 - I have said repeatedly in the parliament and elsewhere that Australia is well served by its financial regulators. Can I also say to the Leader of the Opposition, in response to his question - and I listened carefully to his remarks before and his statement to the parliament about the previous government's robust response to recommendations on better regulation of the Australian financial system - what did the previous government do about recommendations over many years for the establishment of a deposit insurance scheme in Australia? In June 2000, the FSF study group on deposit insurance recommended:An effective deposit insurance system can promote public confidence and contribute to the stability of the financial system _What did the previous government do about that? Nothing. In September 2002, APRA's submission to the HIH royal commission called for a financial claim scheme to protect insurance policyholders and creditors, including deposit holders in the financial system. What did they do about that? Nothing. What happened with the government's previous adviser, Professor Davis, when he recommended:Internationally, deposit insurance and insurance policyholder protection schemes are becoming widespread. Australia is one of only two Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries without some form of explicit deposit insurance.What did they do about that? Nothing. And so the list goes on.I noted very carefully the Leader of the Opposition quoting his new ideologue of choice, Mr John Taylor, someone who is a well-known supporter of - if not somewhat infatuated with - Milton Friedman, the father of deregulation, together with Friedrich Hayek. What did Taylor say when he was asked about Milton Friedman? Taylor - the person who the Leader of the Opposition has quoted extensively, not just today but elsewhere; the person who idolises Milton Friedman - says:I keep asking myself, 'What would Milton say? What would Milton do?' _If you want a clear statement of the right-wing deregulation, antiregulation agenda to which you have linked yourself, out of your own mouth, I simply draw your attention to the full text of what Mr Taylor has said. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her very important question, because the Nation Building and Jobs Plan announced today is very important to support jobs. Of course, the good news today is that this plan is backed by a further decision by the Reserve Bank board to reduce rates by a further 100 basis points. What we have is fiscal policy and monetary policy moving very strongly in the same direction. I also welcome the decision of the Westpac bank to pass that on in full, and I repeat what the Prime Minister said earlier: we do expect other banks to pass this rate cut on in a timely way. Because of the global financial crisis and the global recession that it has caused, we need fiscal policy and monetary policy working strongly together. And they are - they are working in tandem - and the Reserve Bank board have acknowledged that in their statement today. The challenge that we face is so serious that we do need all elements of policy, all elements of government, all regulators and everyone in the community working together to support jobs. This plan will support 90,000 jobs over two years.I want to talk about a couple of elements of this plan, because the Leader of the Opposition, in his comments before, was simply all over the place. The first point of the plan is that we are going to spend $28.8 billion to build the schools and roads and homes and communities and to have the energy efficiency we all need for a future economy. These are measures which will make Australia a better place. But, most importantly - and this is the dual benefit we get from this sort of investment - it will create jobs directly. I was gobsmacked when the Leader of the Opposition was talking before about the building of schools. He was somehow unaware that that involved the private sector. I do not know where he has been for the last 20 or 30 years, but this program will support thousands of jobs in the building and construction sector of this country, not only across our capital cities but in just about every community in this great nation. That is why it deserves the support of those opposite. Why do we have a measure like this? It is because the global recession has produced a collapse in private business investment, so what we are moving to do is to put in place public investment. In so doing, we have the full support of the private sector in this country - but, apparently, not the Leader of the Opposition.The second part of the package is a $12.7 billion boost to consumption so we can support jobs now. The Leader of the Opposition, that disciple of Milton Friedman, is out there with an argument that somehow, instead of making lump sum payments now, what we should have done was to bring forward the 1 July tax cuts. That is his argument. Is that correct? Is that what the opposition's position is? - Let us just say theoretically that, if we were to take the decision to bring forward the 1 July tax cuts, what that would deliver to a taxpayer on $30,000 is $150. What our proposal delivers is an additional $800, making $950. That is fiscal stimulus. It is the fiscal stimulus which was recommended by authorities right around the world. The IMF said again on the weekend that if you wanted to stimulate demand directly the best way to do it was through direct payments as soon as possible. But of course the Leader of the Opposition somehow thinks that delivering $150 to someone on $30,000 is a fiscal stimulus. We all know that he lives in a different world from the rest of us, and he has proved it here again today. He made the remarkable statement that consumers or taxpayers out there would either save or spend their payment. That was a blinding truth. It is obvious. The trick here - and the important thing for Australia - is to pay the money to those people who have the highest propensity to consume, and that is exactly what we are doing. Of course, it is exactly what the government did in the package of last October, which was delivered from 8 December. We had it from one over there -  - It all went through the pokies, did it? Note their contempt for working families on low incomes. Note their contempt for pensioners on low and fixed incomes. They do not have a clue what it is like to survive on a low income, but what we know is that if we can give a break to people who deserve a break we will do it - and if we can benefit the Australian economy and create jobs on the way through, all the better. That is exactly what we are doing. Of course, the evidence that is coming out does show that, through December and January, that consumption was strengthened. And so it needed to be, because as it turned out the month of December was a horrible month in the global economy and there was a very sharp contraction of demand right around the world. Our Economic Security Strategy, delivered in payments from 8 December, just arrived in time. Those opposite said at the time that they supported it. They said it on day one, and they have opposed it every day since then. They are not fair dinkum about being bipartisan at all. They are not fair dinkum about anything.We had the other blinding truth from the shadow Treasurer. Two days ago she said, 'You could give broad, generalised tax cuts and raise revenue.' How do you work out that magic pudding? What we want and what we would like is for there to be agreement in this country - not just across the parliament but across the whole community - because this is a national economic emergency in the middle of a global recession, and we in the Rudd government intend to do everything we possibly can to strengthen growth and to support jobs.When those opposite oppose these measures, as they appear to be doing, they are opposing jobs. That is what they are doing with all this point-scoring and rubbish about Professor Taylor. Professor Taylor does not represent the mainstream thought in the economics profession on this question - far from it. He is an extremist, and at the recent conference of economists in America he was virtually run out and his position was not supported. So they are trying to find some bogus evidence to justify a bogus political position because they cannot support measures they ought to support in the national interest. So we on this side of the House will continue to work responsibly to put in place plans which support jobs and do it in a timely way.The thing about this package that is so important is that it is timely and it is temporary, because we also understand that these measures should not be put into the budget forever. The Leader of the Opposition indicated before that they should. He wants permanent tax cuts. We are putting in, for the time being, a temporary stimulus. We have tax cuts coming through on 1 July this year and next year, but somehow I think he and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, favour big, generalised tax cuts, which produce bigger deficits in this environment. So they do not know what they stand for. Do they stand for deficits or not? All they stand for is their own miserable political hides, because, if they were really genuinely interested in supporting the 90,000 jobs that this package will support, they would give it their full support right now.</DOC>

 - I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to comments I made in a press conference just before question time, which I will repeat here for his benefit. That is that, on the question of supporting jobs through fiscal stimulus, obviously that means that jobs can be created through direct government investment. It also means that it helps retain jobs which currently exist in the private sector. The second part of the honourable member's question goes to the impact of the Economic Security Strategy. That strategy, as you know, was announced in October; the payments were delivered in December. In terms of an early response to the questions raised by the Leader of the Opposition for which the data is obviously nowhere near complete, we have an Australian company which is able to provide comparable data for the period. Westfield today released figures which show that spending in the month of December 2008 was up 2.5 per cent from the previous year.If spending is up in retail, I would have thought that small businesses employing people in retail may be benefited by that. Or the alternative is that those opposite think that somehow there is the dead hand of socialism out there doing everything. Or is it the same logic as the Leader of the Opposition was arguing before that, if we invest in infrastructure and schools, some government monolith descends and builds all those schools and houses? It is the private sector - in retail, in construction - that actually does these jobs. That is why we are spending; that is why we are investing. We are supporting the private economy in order to fill the gap which has been left by the withdrawal of private sector activity.To return to the point of contrast which those opposite, I think, find difficult, it is this: Westfield, an Australian supermarket chain, which operates globally in terms of shopping centres around the world, has produced figures today which demonstrate that spending in the month of December was up 2.5 per cent from the previous year. This is in contrast to their overseas sales, which were down by 14 per cent in the US and seven per cent in New Zealand. This is a clear contrast, and if those opposite deride and scoff at the role which private sector retail plays in providing employment in Australia it shows how far out of touch they have become. - Those opposite like to scoff. They like to simply carp from the sidelines. They want to engage in political point-scoring. This government is determined to invest in public infrastructure to support jobs. It is determined to invest also in supporting families who, through their consumption, support retail efforts across the economy as well and the employment which is generated within it. This government is determined also to invest in and support, through government effort and action, the continued stability of Australian financial markets. It is all these measures taken together which add up to appropriate support for continued growth and jobs in the Australian economy. The alternative, which at its heart of hearts is left exposed by the speech just given by the Leader of the Opposition, is to do nothing other than one thing he has suggested: bring forward tax cuts and somehow intellectually reconcile permanent tax cuts with a strategy which they also would be advocating, which is a rational approach to eliminating deficit in the future.An incident having occurred in the gallery - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for her question. I know she is deeply interested in education and the circumstances of schools in her electorate. Each and every day since the Rudd Labor government was elected we have been delivering an education revolution, including $2 billion for the Digital Education Revolution, $2½ billion for Trade Training Centres in Schools and more than $60 million to support cooperative projects between schools.Today we move to a new phase, with a $14.7 billion investment in Building the Education Revolution. This is an investment in all 9,540 schools in this country. Primary schools will be invested in under our Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition might mock that title, but I can assure him that it is not very funny for those teachers and students who work in the 19th century facilities that they were left with after the 12 long years of the Howard government. Primary Schools for the 21st Century covers primary schools, special schools and combined primary and secondary schools, and schools will be able to get grants to build the new learning spaces that they need, particularly 21st century libraries and 21st century multipurpose areas for performing arts, assemblies and indoor gymnasiums. These are the things that schools are crying out for. This investment enables schools to get the assistance they need, and depending on school size the amount of assistance can be up to $3 million.Then there is our Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools program, enabling the construction of 500 new science laboratories or language learning centres - of course, key skills for the 21st century, where you need 21st century infrastructure. Then there is the Renewing Australia's Schools program, a $1.3 billion program to refurbish and renew infrastructure in schools - for the maintenance and small projects that schools need. Under this program schools will be able to receive up to $200,000, depending on their size. This is building an education revolution in each and every school in this country. In addition, we are bringing forward an extra $110 million as part of our very successful Trade Training Centres in Schools Program to enable secondary schools to have access to 21st century facilities to learn trades so that students can choose that life path and not be forced, as they were under the Howard government, to learn in facilities better suited to the 1950s than the 21st century.We are investing directly in the formation of skills during this global financial crisis. In particular we are investing more than a billion dollars in our training and learning bonus. This investment is to give assistance to eligible students, such as people who have youth allowance as a benefit, to enable them to be compensated for the costs of education. In addition, it enables eligible social security recipients to receive a one-off payment to enable them to meet the costs of returning to study. We know that continuing to train and continuing to form skills during economic days such as these is very important. The history of past economic times has told us that if there is a lack of skills and training then, inevitably, when the economy grows that leads to skills shortages. We want to avoid that cycle by maximising our training effort in these difficult days. - I know, and now the shadow minister for education is verifying this, that the sort of attitude the Liberal Party will bring to this will be one of contempt and mockery. We have already seen the Leader of the Opposition start that. The school children in schools across the country, the teachers who teach there, the principals that lead them and the parents who send their children to those new facilities will be looking forward to these new investments as part of an education revolution because they want their children to get the very best education possible, and this infrastructure is part of delivering it.</DOC>

 - In developing its response to the global financial crisis and the unfolding global economic recession, the government has continued to examine the full range of options as to what provides the best basis for stimulus in the economy to continue to support positive growth and therefore to support jobs. What we have concluded through those deliberations is that the one measure which the opposition advocates - that is, to bring forward generic tax cuts or, depending on the day of the week you are talking about, to initiate a new set of generic tax cuts - would simply not work in delivering the employment impact which we all desire to see in this country.In fact, if we look specifically at the measure which has been advocated by those opposite, which is either a new set of tax cuts or bringing forward an existing set of generic tax cuts, we have been guided entirely by the overwhelming body of evidence which suggests that in fact it is through investment in infrastructure, short- and long-term; measures to support consumption; and, critically, investments to support the stability of private credit markets to ensure the flow-through of credit to the private economy which are most effective in supporting activity through these extraordinary times.I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that we have been careful and deliberative in examining all these matters. We are acutely conscious of what is bearing down on Australia from the global economic crisis and the global recession over the next year or so. As a consequence, we have embraced the set of measures which are outlined in today's document. We are confident this forms a core and continuing part of the strategy we embarked upon at the end of last year - a strategy which will see Australia through this crisis. I commend it again to the opposition for their support.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question. The government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan includes some $890 million for short-term infrastructure projects in transport, regional development and local government. This, of course, comes on top of the $4.7 billion nation-building program that we announced at the end of last year and our record funding of rail and road projects. This package provides for $500 million - half a billion dollars - for local capital works delivered through local government. This comes on top of the $300 million that we announced in November in conjunction with the Australian Council of Local Government. I will be meeting with the Australian Council of Local Government steering committee here in Canberra on Thursday.Applications closed last Friday for the $250 million component of the $300 million package that we announced in November, for which each and every council around the country was eligible. Every single council in the nation - every one; no exceptions - submitted an application for those grants. If they are all approved, some 3,605 local projects will be funded. Those are local jobs in local communities, providing stimulus to local economies - real jobs with real benefits on the ground.This morning, my department submitted the first tranche of projects to be approved - projects that had satisfied the criteria. Those 10 projects were from Burnie City Council in Braddon in Tasmania; Cloncurry Shire Council from Kennedy in Queensland; Coffs Harbour City Council from Cowper in New South Wales; the District Council of Coober Pedy from Grey in South Australia; Exmouth Shire Council from Kalgoorlie in Western Australia; Frankston City Council from the electorate of Dunkley in Victoria; Fremantle City Council in Western Australia; Goondiwindi Shire Council from Maranoa in Queensland; Katherine City Council from Lingiari in the Northern Territory and Moree Plains Shire Council from the electorate of Parkes in rural New South Wales.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: when he is considering what their position will be on this latest program and on the $500 million increase in this package, which projects is he against? Which local communities should not be given support for these local capital works? We know that if you are serious about providing stimulus in the short term - projects that are 'shovel ready', to quote the shadow minister for infrastructure on Fran Kelly's program this morning - then the priorities determined for local capital works by local communities are the way to go forward. But what we are seeing from the opposition once again is the Turnbull shuffle. Once again, in principle they are sort of for things, but when it comes to the crunch they just nitpick and oppose without putting up anything constructive. We at least have missed the middle phase, which is usually that they claim credit for the ideas that have been put forward by the government.These projects are added to by the other initiatives in the area that I have responsibility for - practical programs such as $150 million to improve safety at level crossings through the installation of boom gates and other safety mechanisms, something that has not been prioritised before, something that we know has real impact, particularly -  - By state governments - they go back to the blame game. We are actually getting on with the job of delivering here, and I say to the Leader of the Opposition: is he opposed to that initiative? Or is he opposed to the initiative of $150 million being spent on road maintenance this financial year for our regional roads? The previous government ignored the issue of maintenance in terms of our national highways when it delivered the former AusLink program. All of these initiatives are characterised by the fact that they will create jobs, they can do it quickly to stimulate the economy and they can have long-term benefits in local communities.</DOC>

 - I think the shadow Treasurer has just shown yet again how out of her depth she is. We are in the middle of a global recession which has been caused by a global financial crisis, which has seen the International Monetary Fund revise down their projections of growth three times in the last four months, which has seen global growth go from the strongest that we have seen in 30 years a bit over a year ago, at five per cent -  - So Gough caused that too, did he? This is just the sort of -  -  - This is a very serious debate, and we are quite happy to have a discussion with the opposition about the best way to respond to a global recession which has now imposed on Australia very substantial deficits out across the forward estimates. That is exactly what has happened. Revenue was written down by $40 billion over the forward estimates in MYEFO, and by a further $75 billion in the statement today. That is not just a very substantial hit to the government's bottom line but reflects the damage that has been done to this economy by these global events. It reflects the damage that has hit people who have super. It reflects the damage that has been done to people who are investors in the stock market. And for the opposition to carry on in that vein is an insult to all of those people who have been hurt by the global financial crisis and the global recession -  -  - The rest of the world has imposed a temporary deficit on this country, and it has been left to this government to decide the course that we will chart ahead. And we have decided, in line with recommendations from international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund, to fill the gap created by this very sharp contraction in private demand and to do that in a couple of ways, which I explained earlier. Of course, that means the deficit is a little higher as a consequence of the decision to put this package forward, which we have taken in the national interest to support jobs. What we have done is the responsible thing. What is coming from those opposite is utterly irresponsible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Australia has received quite a bit of bad economic news over the last couple of months. China's growth rate has virtually halved, the IMF is predicting global growth of 0.5 per cent - the lowest level for many decades - and, of course, we have seen a $115 billion hole blown in our forward projections for revenue over four years. In response, the government is taking decisive action to stimulate economic activity in our economy, and today we have put forward a package that is carefully crafted to ensure that we have the maximum stimulus and the maximum effect across the widest possible range. The package includes temporary tax bonuses, one-off payments and investment in infrastructure, energy efficiency and schools.It is inevitable that in the lead-up to this package and also in its wake there will be debate about the design of the stimulus and about exactly how it should occur. I want to deal with a couple of the key themes that have emerged in recent weeks about this issue, particularly from the opposition but not just from them. These themes were reiterated by the Leader of the Opposition today. The first is the suggestion that much, if not a majority, of the package that was put forward in December would be saved and that it was therefore of no benefit to the Australian economy and of no benefit to jobs. There is a huge fallacy in this view, and that is the fact that, even though some people will save some of that money for a period of time, much of it will in effect be replaced by spending in a week's time, in a month's time or in three months time. If you owe $2,000 on your credit card and the government gives you a one-off payment of $2,000 and you use that not to spend immediately but to pay down your credit card, guess what? The answer is that you are probably not going to be paying down your credit card from your next pay packet - or the one after that, or the one after that - because it will be zero. So the stimulatory effect of those one-off payments will be partly immediate and partly in the ensuing weeks and months; and even that money which is saved in the long term - such as for paying down the mortgage - will effectively liberate an equivalent amount of money available for bank lending, because of course the bank is lending you, the individual, less money than it otherwise would be. There has been a lot of confusion about this, reiterated by the Leader of the Opposition today when he indicated the great flash of genius that these payments could be either spent or saved.That confusion has also been reflected in the commentary from the opposition in the lead-up to today's package. There has been a great deal of confusion and, as usual, first prize for confusion goes to the member for Curtin, the shadow Treasurer, who said on Sunday that the government should pursue 'broad and sweeping tax cuts that will increase the tax base and increase tax revenues.' Does that sound familiar? Like almost everything we hear from the member for Curtin, there is a familiar ring about this. It is extremely reminiscent of the theories of the now discredited Professor Arthur Laffer, the progenitor of the Laffer curve - the great theory that has produced massive ongoing budget deficits in the United States and has left President Barack Obama with a giant budget deficit to deal with. The theory is that, if you cut taxes, people will work more, they will spend more, they will generate more activity, they will pay more taxes and, magically, the hole in the revenue that has been created by cutting taxes will somehow be filled. This theory has been discredited even, I suspect, amongst Republican economists - with the exception of the one the Leader of the Opposition follows - in the United States. But apparently it is not discredited for the opposition.The opposition's suggestions that somehow they are credible on the question of the budget going into deficit is directly contradicted by their advocating blowing a huge permanent hole in the revenue base that would supposedly be filled by the completely discredited analysis of this Professor Laffer. They are picking up the dregs of failed US Republican policies because they have got no ideas of their own.The government have not chosen to head down that path, partly because we already have very substantial tax cuts built into both the current financial year's budget and the forthcoming financial year's budget. The government are committed to getting the budget back into surplus as quickly as possible, and there are three things that will enable that: first, the natural growth of tax revenues back to the ceiling of tax as a proportion of the total economy that we committed ourselves to prior to the election; second, that once the economy resumes normal trend growth rate we will not increase spending beyond two per cent real per annum; and, third, that new policy proposals will be subject to the clear objective of being offset by either spending cuts or equivalent offsets from that portfolio.The opposition's approach, to the extent that it is possible to get any coherent position from them, is simply a recipe for huge deficits into the indeterminable future. For them to argue that they are the solution to the temporary deficit problem that the world is imposing upon us and, at the same time, to put forward their solution is completely fallacious. The government has got a balanced package that will deliver substantial economic stimulus and ensure that growth and jobs are supported in the immediate term and will invest in productivity and wealth-generating infrastructure in the medium and longer term.</DOC>

 - The government is proud of each of the measures that it has taken so far in response to the global financial crisis. The reason for that is that they all represent an overriding discipline to do whatever is necessary to continue to support growth and jobs. We have embraced the measures that we have introduced, including: firstly, the Economic Security Strategy of $10.4 billion last year; secondly, the COAG payments underpinning both health and education reforms of some $15 billion spread out over a four- to five-year period; thirdly, the $6.1 billion long-term plan to assist with the retooling of the Australian automobile industry and associated industry components; fourthly, last year's decision to embrace a one-off injection of $300 million into local government; and, fifthly, the $4.6 billion nation-building document released at the end of last year, which included within it not just infrastructure packages on roads but also an announcement in response to the recommendations of business for a one-off investment allowance of some 10 per cent. On top of that, we have the $42 billion package that we have announced today.Each of these measures, in the immediate, short and long term, is necessary to continue to generate activity, growth and jobs in the economy. As the honourable member would know if he were being intellectually honest about the question that he asks, there is no magic in any of this. The alternative which those opposite in their own scoffing way recommend is, in effect, for government to do nothing other than the one proposal that has been put forward, which is a set of tax cuts brought forward - or the lack of proposal, eloquently described by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation in his last answer to the House. In fact, building on that, we have a statement by the member for Curtin. Just the other day, when asked why she was advocating such tax cuts, she said, 'Well, the fact that the Treasurer has ruled out tax cuts is the reason I'm putting them forward.' - If you go through that list of five sets of measures last year, each of them has a specific timeline attached to the injection of funds. The COAG package - as the honourable member, if he were being honest about it, would know - involves funding agreements with the states over a four- to five-year spread, depending on the nature of the individual agreement concerned. He knows that, and he seeks to stand at the dispatch box and make a political point about the jobs impact now. He knows that to be untrue. He is just interested in making a retail political point in order to get himself a headline. The bottom line is that each of those measures has a different delivery point and the cumulative impact in terms of overall job creation will be seen over a course of time.The alternative recommended by those opposite - if you listen carefully to everything, leaving aside the Turnbull three step, adequately described before by the minister for infrastructure - is to claim the idea as their own or initially support and then oppose. Leaving all that to one side, in substance they have opposed each of the measures we have put forward so far - each and every one of them. We have there an avalanche of negativity. The only proposal they have put forward is one about bringing forward generic tax cuts, and the intellectual consistency of that argument, against the point just made by the minister for finance about bringing a temporary deficit back into surplus over time, speaks starkly to everyone present. The whole point of a stimulus is for it to be temporary and targeted. That is what we have embraced. You recommend the reverse. Our strategy is clear. Yours lies in tatters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. I know he represents the families in Lindsay with great dedication and he understands just how important it is that the government takes the strong action that it is taking so that the jobs of his constituents are protected. Today is a very important day for the mums and dads around Australia and also for those hardworking Australians - thousands of them - in the housing and construction sector. These are the people who do understand just why it is so important for the government to take the decisive action that it has today in the face of this very serious global financial crisis.A critical measure of the actions that we are taking today is the $6.4 billion investment in social housing, which will see support for thousands of jobs in the housing and construction sector and will also make sure that we see 20,000 houses constructed. Of course, many of those houses will go to those in considerable need in our community: old-aged pensioners, disability pensioners, Indigenous people - all people who will be put under more pressure with this global financial crisis. The Minister for Housing and I have just this afternoon spoken to the state and territory housing and community services ministers, and we will be working very closely with them to make sure that these 20,000 homes are built as quickly as possible.We, of course, understand that we are not going to be able to confront this global financial crisis with this measure alone. As part of our $12.8 billion of support for taxpayers, families will receive extra support as well. There will be just over $4 billion provided through the family tax benefit system. Families with school-age children will receive a $950 back-to-school bonus to help with costs over the school year. That is going to go to those families who receive family tax benefit part A and, as of 3 February, today, have a child aged between four and 18 years of age. These are the families who will receive this one-off payment. We anticipate that is around 1½ million families. We will also complement the tax bonus by providing support to around 1½ million single-income families. This will be done through a $950 single-income family bonus paid to families who are eligible for family tax benefit part B as of 3 February, today.I just want to say to the opposition that the chief executive officer of Centrelink advises us that it is their strong preference for these bills to be passed this week to enable system changes to be made so that payments can begin in March. The opposition, as we have just heard today, is threatening to derail these payments by suggesting that we should continue this debate into next week. I just want to say to the opposition: for the sake of Australian families and for the sake of the economy, pass this legislation this week so that Centrelink can get on with making sure the money gets into people's pockets.</DOC>

 - The cumulative impact of the measures taken by the government last year and this year will be delivered over time. That is clearly reflected in the statement that we have produced for the parliament today. That is our clear position. Secondly, when it comes to the question raised by the Leader of the National Party in relation to this package of measures, can I just say how isolated this Liberal Party and National Party are from where the country now stands. The Australian Primary Principals Association has just put out a statement which says:This is a fantastic win-win for all Australians. The Government's $12.4 billion Primary Schools for 21st Century -  - I thank the member for Sturt for his eloquent intervention. He seems to belong to the same school of economics as the Leader of the Opposition, which suggests that building a school or a school building does not create jobs. That is the most nonsensical proposition to be advanced in this debate so far. Not only are the measures announced by the government today good for the economy and jobs, they also deliver necessary infrastructure. So we have the Australian Primary Principals Association stating that this is a fantastic win-win for all Australians -  - As I indicated to the Leader of the National Party before, the cumulative impact on employment of the government's measures will be delivered over time. In response to the question from the member for Goldstein before, one of the principal measures released last year was for additional payments through COAG to the states for education and health reforms. As the honourable member himself knows, if he is being intellectually honest about it rather than just playing party politics, that is a funding investment delivered over a four- to five-year stretch of time, which was explicitly stated at the time. He knows that; he is simply pretending it is something else. Talking about the Leader of the National Party's own constituency, I have here a release from the National Farmers Federation. 'Farm stimulus to spark economic jump-start,' says the NFF. - Does the Leader of the National Party suggest the government stimulus package is irrelevant to farmers? Is he saying that there are no schools in rural Australia who will benefit from this package? Every small primary school in rural Australia will feel the benefit of investment through this package. - I am responding to the most recent point of order by the Leader of the National Party, who asked the original question. He said that farmers were, in fact, not impacted by any element of last year's package. He assumes that all the Economic Security Strategy measures - $10.4 billion - went to people in cities. Is he suggesting seriously that none of those payments went to people in rural and regional Australia? Is he suggesting that a COAG package of education and health reforms did not extend itself to rural hospitals or to rural schools? The Leader of the National Party should reflect carefully on the $300 million worth of measures announced by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government to local authorities, a large slab of which exists in rural and regional Australia. The Leader of the National Party does not have a clue what he is talking about. It is quite clear that the government's package of measures, both last year and this year, are designed to support the economy, growth and jobs. Each of these packages will be delivered over the spread of time which is indicated by the investment profile attached to each of them. We have a strategy for seeing Australia through this crisis; those opposite seem to content themselves with opportunistic short-term politics. The people of Australia will make up their minds.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Dobell. I know that the construction industry is a very significant employer in his part of the Central Coast. Not only are the tradies up there servicing the Central Coast area but many of them travel to Sydney and further afield to work in the building and construction area. The Nation Building and Jobs Plan includes $6.4 billion for social housing. This is a very significant investment that will help many Australians - homeless Australians, age pensioners, disability support pensioners and women and children escaping domestic violence. This plan builds on our previous housing measures - the first home owner boost, the National Rental Affordability Scheme and others - and will see more than 20,000 new homes built between now and 2012, the majority of them built before the end of 2010. Those homes will be built with $6 billion from this package, and a further $400 million will be spent on urgent repairs and maintenance, bringing forward 2½ thousand homes and making them habitable again.We are also aware that this extra spending will be very important for small businesses right around the country - those small businesses in the building and construction sector that will be doing these repairs, maintenance and building. It will make a huge difference to the lives of many Australians, like the 28,000 pensioners who are in the private rental market paying more than 50 per cent of their pensions on their rent each week, like the 16,000 Australians who are sleeping rough every night and like the thousands of women and children leaving homes where there is domestic violence. This package helps us meet our targets on homelessness. It helps us assist the most poor and disadvantaged Australians. It contributes to the growth and reform of the social housing sector in this country and it supports jobs in construction and maintenance. It has been very well received by the housing industry and by people working with homeless Australians. National Shelter has said:This is the biggest postwar public housing investment this country has seen and is one the Rudd government should be proud of. After 10 years of reduced funding from the Howard government this is an unbelievable result for the people doing it toughest in this country.The HIA says:By unlocking a number of residential projects in the pipeline there will be a substantial multiplier gain to housing starts and jobs.The Government's recovery plan appropriately spends for jobs in the short-term and invests for future prosperity.Because the backlog of residential building projects is spread geographically, the stimulus will generate jobs in cities and towns across the country _The Nationals might remember: this will include jobs in the country. The Master Builders Association says:Boosting the building industry is a proven formula for reviving economies and stimulating jobs growth.The Property Council of Australia, who are very enthusiastic, say:The development industry has the capacity to turn this much-needed injection from the government into bricks and mortar very quickly. This will not only increase supply of public and community housing, but will also keep the industry going, maintaining employment in the sector and ensuring that apprentices are retained and skills are not lost.Anglicare, Catholic Social Services, the Salvation Army and Uniting Care Australia have put out a joint press release welcoming this, saying it:_ will make a real difference on the ground for Australians struggling to meet their accommodation needs.The Salvation Army; Homelessness Australia - the endorsements go on, because this package meets a number of needs. It meets the needs of homeless Australians and people struggling to put a roof over their heads, and it meets our needs to keep a strong construction sector in this country.</DOC>

 - The correct response by an economic conservative is this: in the presence of a virtually unprecedented global economic recession, the government must act and intervene. That is opposed to the radical approach advocated by the Leader of the Opposition, which is to let the free market run loose. That is what he said. Earlier in today's debate he made reference to the Australian Business Investment Partnership. It is the government's resolve to intervene in the private commercial property market to avoid an asset-stripping exercise which would be engaged in by hedge funds of the type that we have seen causing so much of the mayhem in recent times.Our government says intervene. The Leader of the Opposition says, 'Let the free market rip.' I suggest to those opposite that if they continue to embrace this ideology of unrestrained greed, which has been supported and encouraged by unfettered markets around the world, including in financial and property markets, they should learn from history. This government believes that a proper approach of economic conservatism lies in the government intervening where the private market has failed in order to provide stimulus when there has been a contraction in private demand. That is the mainstream economic conservative approach and it is one of which this government is proud.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for that question. The fact is that today's announcement by the Rudd government will produce energy efficiency on a scale that we have never seen in Australia and produce support for green jobs as well. This is a $3.9 billion commitment to energy-efficient homes to provide cost opportunities for householders around Australia, to stimulate those industries which can produce energy efficiency, particularly in ceiling insulation, and to provide additional environmental benefits as well. This announcement is about helping Australians, at a critical time, to meet cost-of-living pressures. It gives them the opportunity to make substantial greenhouse gas reductions and it complements our approach on climate change.Insulation typically provides the most cost-effective household energy efficiency improvement, so the centrepiece of the Energy Efficient Homes program is the rollout of insulation to some 2.7 million Australian homes. This is about maximising energy savings for households, helping with cost-of-living pressures and providing the opportunity for major greenhouse gas reductions. Through this program, Australian households will be looking at possible savings of some $200 on their energy bills, reducing heating and cooling by as much as 40 per cent. The program also includes rebates of up to $1,000 to install insulation in rental homes. That doubles our previous commitment to the Low Emission Plan for Renters.We will be ramping up one of the most cost-effective household energy efficiency improvements. We will be increasing the solar hot water rebate from $1,000 to $1,600, and the rebate will not be means tested. Solar hot water is one of the most efficient ways of harnessing Australia's abundant sunshine and using it to slash home energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is a true solar revolution for Australia's suburbs, taking solar hot water into the mainstream. It is clean, it is green and it is about jobs for Australians.I heard the Leader of the Opposition say that some of the proposals, and now the announcements that we have made, are controversial. The controversy is why the opposition did not do anything about insulation in all the years they were in government. It was sitting there waiting to be done and they did absolutely zip. The fact is that the Energy Efficient Homes program will support jobs in installation and manufacturing, and the government will work with the industry to ensure that job benefits are maximised. The enhanced solar hot water rebates will also support manufacturing and installation jobs.I announce to the House that the programs will be available immediately, with interim arrangements for the Energy Efficient Homes program until it ramps up on 1 July. The Nation Building and Jobs Plan shows that the government are committed to energy efficiency as a key plank in our commitment to tackling climate change. But this single measure will do more for energy efficiency in Australian households. It will provide the opportunity for Australian households to reduce their costs, it will provide the opportunity for Australian householders to do something about reducing greenhouse gas emissions and it will provide support for green jobs. That is what decisive, real action at this time is all about and that is what we are delivering.</DOC>

 - I refer to yet another extraordinary question from the member for Curtin. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Curtin, would be aware that the government last year, acting in concert with the Reserve Bank and reflecting global economic circumstances at the time, moved both fiscal and monetary policy in the same direction, given the challenges which existed at the time. I say to those opposite that one of the challenges we face - and I would suggest to those opposite that they be mindful of this - is that, as we respond to the global financial crisis and embrace the series of fiscal measures which are contained in this package, the packages last year and whatever further action we may take, it is equally important that we have a clear-cut strategy to exit from deficits and a clear-cut strategy to avoid problems at the other end of the economic cycle in terms of what then happens with inflation long term. The problem with previous responses by governments around the world is that they have not been appropriately sensitised to where they are in the economic cycle and therefore how to respond appropriately over time. We have seen that reflected most recently.I would suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, again consistent with the position taken by the government today on fiscal policy, she peruse the formal statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, which says:In making its decision, the Board - of the Reserve Bank - took into account the package of measures announced by the Government earlier today. The combination of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies now in place -  - The intervention by the member for North Sydney is about as ridiculous as the question asked by the member for Curtin.The combination of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies now in place will help to cushion the Australian economy from the contractionary forces coming from abroad.This is a serious debate for the nation - how we respond to a global economic crisis beyond the control of a single national economy, deploying all instruments of policy to rise to the challenge which now confronts us. The government have embarked on that strategy, we will not be deterred from it and we believe that we have charted a strategy which will see Australia through. Again, I would say to those opposite: will they support the strategy that we have advanced - will they support the package of measures contained in the policy put forward today - or will they not? That is the simple question around which they are twisting and turning in this debate. The answer will be delivered soon, when these matters are voted on. I would suggest to those opposite: stop sitting on the fence, start exercising appropriate judgement and support a course of action which will help see Australia through rather than take your traditional course of action over the last 12 months plus, which was to sit on the fence and carp from the sidelines.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I can advise the member for Robertson and also the member for Dobell that the package announced today will be of great benefit to all those small businesses operating on the Central Coast of New South Wales, who have so strongly built the economy and prosperity on the Central Coast. Right around Australia - in outer urban Australia, in regional Australia and in South-East Queensland - small businesses are big winners out of this package announced today.When the government have been designing various initiatives we have had small businesses firmly in mind. We had small businesses firmly in mind when we were designing last October's fiscal stimulus package. We had small businesses firmly in mind when we were designing the tax measures that were announced in December last year and, similarly, when we announced the financing arrangements for car dealers, because in fact most car dealers are small businesses. We had small businesses firmly in mind in designing the $4 billion Australian Business Investment Partnership. Who builds commercial property? It is small businesses - it is contractors - and they will benefit from this initiative. Small businesses will benefit greatly from the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, announced by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer today.It is a huge fiscal stimulus. Small businesses are big winners from it. One particular component of it is a boost in the investment allowance, which was announced in December last year, from 10 per cent to 30 per cent. That means a lot more incentive for small businesses to invest and, of special relevance to small businesses, we have reduced the threshold for eligibility for capital expenditures under this initiative, from $10,000 to $1,000. One consequence of that is pretty obvious: if you bought, for example, a coffee-making machine or a laptop computer, it might not cost $10,000 - you would not think so for a laptop computer; it would have to be a ripper - but somewhere between $1,000 and $10,000 is ordinarily the cost of a laptop computer, so it now qualifies for the 30 per cent investment allowance. That is great news for small business. It will encourage small businesses to bring forward investment and it will encourage small businesses to undertake investments that they otherwise might not have undertaken.Importantly, during the earlier debate, the shadow minister for small business said, 'But how's this going to boost small business cash flow?' I can tell him. Imagine a $20,000 piece of capital equipment for an office or a factory. Through this investment allowance, a special tax deduction of $6,000 becomes available. If you get a tax deduction of $6,000 that you did not otherwise get, what does that do? It boosts small business cash flow. Is there any wonder that the opposition does not understand basic economics and does not understand basic tax law? I can report that the Australian Industry Group is at odds with the shadow minister for small business, because, just today, in response to the package, it said:The nation building and jobs plan announced by the Federal Government today _ will provide a big stimulus to help keep the economy moving _The package targets consumer spending, which is absolutely critical to our near-term economic prospects, and boosts capital expenditure - looming as one of the real casualties of the downturn.I draw the attention of the House to this statement:In particular, business welcomes the $2.7 billion investment incentive. This measure will help sustain business investment and support jobs and productivity improvements.There you are, Mr Speaker: the endorsement of the Australian Industry Group. I have spoken to many small business organisations. They are thrilled about this boost in the investment allowance and the increasing availability of it. It builds upon the 20 per cent income tax instalment discount, which will be available from 2 March this year. We know this: for small businesses, cash flow is king. We are boosting the cash flow of small businesses, supporting the Australian economy, supporting our great entrepreneurs and supporting the nearly four million Australians employed in those businesses.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question, the government's position in terms of pass-through is consistent across all banks in relation to interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank - that is, there should be full pass-through as rapidly as possible. I am particularly concerned about the impact on small business borrowing and the availability and the price of credit. The government is also particularly concerned about the impact on other vehicles of credit, including credit cards. The government is monitoring both these areas very closely.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He understands that there is no silver bullet, but the government's tough decisions in response to the global recession strike a responsible balance between supporting jobs now -  -  - Presumably, you will support what I am about to ask you to support - that is, the building of homes, schools, roads and communities that we need for future growth. We know that the Prime Minister has announced this $42 billion nation-building and jobs package. I know that the member for Solomon would say that this is strong and decisive action to support jobs and the economy in the face of the worst global recession since the Great Depression. I also know that the member for Solomon has a large number of Defence Force personnel in his electorate, as do other members in the chamber, and I include of course the member for Herbert over there. He would know and support the view that it is important that we look after the interests of all Australia's Defence Force personnel.One aspect of looking after Australian Defence Force personnel is making sure we have appropriate housing and the best quality housing available. As a result, the government will provide $251.6 million to the Defence Housing Authority to construct 802 dwellings for Australian defence personnel in metropolitan and regional centres. Building will commence in April of this year and continue until mid-2011. The construction, importantly, will be in addition to the DHA's existing plans for new construction.I want to amplify the remarks made by the Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women in talking about the importance of the construction industry to the Australian economy. It is important to comprehend that these new houses will be developed in 17 regions across Australia. There will be 100 homes in Adelaide, 103 in Brisbane, 185 in Darwin, which I am sure will be supported by the member for Solomon, and 118 in Townsville. I am assuming the member for Herbert will be saying to the Leader of the Opposition, 'You must support this initiative,' and be saying to the opposition, 'You should be supporting this package of proposals.'For the DHA this will mean a building activity increase of approximately 74 per cent over the period. The additional building program, I am told, will support up to 2,000 jobs. I say to the members of the opposition, particularly those who have Defence Force personnel in their electorates: make sure that your leader supports this package.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because this is a serious matter for all those who hold credit cards. I am advised that Canstar Cannex data indicates there are about 342 credit cards on the market provided by some 78 different providers. Credit cards offer interest rates, I am advised, ranging between seven per cent and 21 per cent, with interest-free periods ranging from zero to 62 days. There has been, furthermore, an explosion in credit card debt. In the period that the previous government was in office it increased by 500 per cent from $6.6 billion, where it stood in 1996, to $41.9 billion, which is where it stood in 2007.The impact of interest rates on credit card holders is of deep concern to the government. I say to the banks, in relation to both credit card interest rates as well as interest rates imposed on small-business lenders, that we would expect the banks to provide maximum pass-through of the benefit given by official interest rate cuts to the entire range of their customers, and we will be continuing to engage the banks on this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for the question. He is a member who understands that times of drought and hardship impact not just on the farmers in the area but on businesses in towns. You can contrast that with today being the extraordinary day when the Leader of the Nationals intervened to try to stop the Prime Minister talking about farmers. Years of drought, rising input costs, fluctuating commodity prices and now a global economic crisis have created extraordinary challenges for many of Australia's farmers. Their capacity to have a disposable income affects not just their families but their entire town. By providing farmers within EC declared areas with the hardship payment announced by the Prime Minister today, the government is taking a further step to boost economic activity in rural and regional towns and cities.The $950 payment to assist farmers experiencing hardship within EC declared areas due to drought conditions will be made in addition to other payments that those farmers may well be eligible for under the plan. That not only provides assistance for those farm families but provides assistance for the towns that, like the farmers in those areas, have been suffering through the period of drought.There was an opinion on the plan - different from the National Party's opinion, I have to say - released today by a group known to some of the members opposite: the National Farmers Federation. Whereas those opposite have tended to oppose these payments and have gone down their normal path of carping, whingeing and complaining, the response from the National Farmers Federation has been somewhat different. They described the farmers payment as 'a much-needed fillip to families and regional economies'. When those opposite ask, 'Where will the jobs be?', the opinion of the NFF is simple. When they referred to the infrastructure spending in the package, they said that this 'will see a major revamp of country services and shore up jobs in local communities'. In considering the small business payment, the view of those opposite has been made clear. The view of the National Farmers Federation is that that small business payment will be greatly appreciated by small, family owned farms. On those farms with annual turnovers of more than $2 million, we had the comment from the NFF that farmers are 'continuing to invest in new equipment, which can help to keep the economy ticking over'. Australia's farmers know the benefits that lie in today's package, even if those opposite do not.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member's question: he will be familiar with a couple of facts. The first is a collapse in government revenues over two periods now. This was first announced at the time of MYEFO, where revenues collapsed at $40 billion. Since then, there has been a further collapse in revenues of $75 billion. Secondly, in terms of additional borrowing requirements for the government, there are, of course, the other costs, including enhanced social security payments, which flow from increased unemployment and other associated social security payments. So that is the second factor. The third factor goes to the actual cost of funding the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which the government announced yesterday. If you aggregate the three measures that I have just referred to, it requires borrowing. I would challenge the Leader of the Opposition to identify in this chamber which individual measures, of all those referred to, he chooses not to support, because he knows, as everyone else knows, that in these economic circumstances they can only be financed by borrowing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because it goes to the heart of how this nation responds to a global financial crisis, which is becoming a global economic crisis and, in turn, a global employment crisis. As I have said to the House before and will say again, there are two strategic choices for the national leadership of Australia: either to take a concrete course of action to seek to reduce the impact of this global recession on Australians - who did not cause this crisis - or to simply sit on the fence and carp. Those represent the alternatives for the leadership of the nation. The Labor government has decided on a course of action. Those opposite have decided to remain firmly sitting on the fence carping because they have concluded that it is to their political advantage so to do.In relation to the content of the package that we have put forward, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Education and I today went out and visited a school: St Gregory's parish school in Queanbeyan. It is one of 7,400 primary schools in Australia - Catholic, independent and government - right across the country, where this government has resolved to invest, together with the secondary school program and maintenance programs, nearly $15 billion. When I was at St Gregory's this morning, they outlined to me how they were currently in the business of building a new library resource centre. It is costing them $1½ million through the renovation of a building that has been there since the 1960s. They pointed out to me at that school that they have demountables in which the kids are still studying, and for a school of 600 kids they have actually no assembly hall - none whatsoever. When I spoke to the principal -  -  - This is a Catholic school. -  - Those opposite just interjected something about state schools. It is a Catholic school. The principal said, 'What we really need in this school is an assembly hall in order to bring the kids together.' In the stinking hot days in which the kids went back to primary school last week, and in the depths of winter here in this part of Australia, it is pretty hard to bring the school together in a single place. So what that principal said to me - and I imagine he will resolve this with the Catholic education authority - is that he wants to see projects like that advanced within his school. It is a school of 600 in our neighbourhood, and I was out there this morning with the member for Eden-Monaro. -  - I would suggest to those opposite that on behalf of each one of them right across the country - each one of the primary schools in each one of your electorates - what you have embarked upon today is to vote against the biggest building program in every primary school in the nation -  -  - In the electorate of North Sydney; in the electorate of Curtin; in the electorate of Wentworth; throughout Adelaide; throughout Brisbane; throughout Queensland - in every state of the country you are voting no against what the schoolteachers, the P&amp;Cs and the P&amp;Fs of this nation are demanding. And you are doing so for one reason and one reason alone: rank political expediency. Because I suspect that -  - I notice that the member for Higgins up the back has a quiet chortle to himself. I think he knows what my reference is, as yon Higgins has again a hungry look when it comes to questions of Liberal Party leadership. There is always a backward glance to see what Higgins might be up to.Can I just say this: when the Leader of the Opposition in effect said, in a statement today, that building school infrastructure was not the highest infrastructure priority of the nation -  - Ah! So he says that school infrastructure -  -  - We have it confirmed from the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Liberal Party, that building school infrastructure is not an infrastructure priority for the nation. That is what he said. On the question of hospitals, as they twist and turn and have to deal with every P&amp;C and P&amp;F in each of their electorates who comes and says, 'Why are you voting against a building program for the primary schools in your electorate?' what this Leader of the Opposition then seeks to deflect to is the necessary investment in hospitals. Following 12 years of Liberal government, they are talking to us about the priority of investment in public hospitals - after they gouged $1 billion out of public hospital expenditure. I have seen it all!In our first year in office, at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments in this building in December last year, what did we agree on? A $4.8 billion plan with the states and territories to reinvest in public hospitals, a $1.1 billion plan to invest in the future human resource needs of the health system, further investment when it comes to emergency services of $750 million and further investment when it comes to elective surgery of $600 million. We have done all these things in one year, and those opposite have the absolute audacity to stand here and challenge whether we regard public hospitals as an infrastructure priority. The truth is that in their 12 years in office what characterised those opposite was that no infrastructure whatsoever was a priority. You ripped and gouged at public hospitals, you failed to invest in our universities, you failed to invest in our TAFEs and now you refuse to invest in our primary schools. I say to those opposite that the contrast in terms of nation building is clear.I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that his and the Liberal Party's opposition to the biggest nation building and school modernisation plan for Australia demonstrates how out of touch they have become. The Liberal Party are out of touch with P&amp;Cs, P&amp;Fs and mums and dads seeking to have decent buildings for their kids in primary schools, out of touch with mums and dads struggling with paying back-to-school costs and out of touch with small business, who want the measures that we foreshadowed yesterday by way of the accelerated investment allowance. You are out of touch with the needs of tradies, carpenters and plumbers, who are desperately seeking new project work. You are out of touch with the real needs of Australians. Instead, his prescription is this: stand to one side and allow the Australian people, Australian tradies and mums and dads to face and endure the full brunt of this global economic recession without government stepping in to help. That is the alternative.I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House that the challenge for the nation at a time of unprecedented global economic challenge is clear-cut: either you act and government intervenes to help stabilise financial markets, to help increase growth, to help support jobs and to help families deal with the consequences of this global recession, or you vacate the field, as recommended by the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is out of touch with mums' and dads' basic needs right across country. This government will get on with the business of seeking to protect the Australian economy and families as much as is humanly possible from a global economic recession, which they did not cause and which free market fundamentalism has rammed in their direction.</DOC>

 - Just occasionally there is a question from the Leader of the Liberal Party which really takes your breath away. Uniquely across the world, in terms of what has happened to the world in the global economic crisis, we have positive news in terms of retail sales in December - and those opposite want to simply cry foul and say it is not good enough. Across the world, retail collapsed in December. In the United States there was a massive collapse in retail. You saw it also in the data I referred to yesterday from Westfield in New Zealand and other sources. The retail sales data produced officially today demonstrate that we have, through the measures provided by the government at the end of last year, investment by consumers in consumption which helps support all the businesses employing people in the retail sector.Those opposite - who claim from time to time, depending on the season, to stand up for the interests of small business - fail to understand how much small business is concentrated in the retail sector. Are you seriously saying to the government that the investment which we made through that allocation to families last year, the impact which it has had on retail sales and the flow-through effect which it has had on the small retail businesses of this country is of no consequence? That statement demonstrates one thing: those opposite have embarked upon a campaign of negativity, negativity, negativity. We are in the business of embarking upon a positive course of action to see the nation through, and the Leader of the Opposition should think better of the retail sector in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question; I know how interested she is in the circumstances of schools in her electorate. We have had reaction to the announcement yesterday from all of those who are in touch with the needs of Australian schools - those who work in schools, those whose children go to school and those who represent schools in the public debate. Those in touch with the needs of Australian schools have, of course, welcomed the government's historic Building the Education Revolution package and its historic $14.7 billion investment in primary schools, special schools, schools that service primary and secondary students together, K to 12 schools and secondary schools. To give you just a flavour of the responses, Mr Bill Daniels, who represents the Independent Schools Council of Australia, welcomes this substantial investment in capital infrastructure and said that it 'will greatly benefit independent school communities across Australia'. The President of the Australian Primary Principals Association, Leonie Trimper, said:Today's announcement is fantastic news for Australia's 7,500 primary schools _ This is a fantastic win-win for all Australians _ it is also a lasting investment in Australia's future - our primary school students.I could, of course, go on to a host of other supportive comments, but perhaps the sentiment was best caught by Mr Bill Bird, the Principal of Kingsgrove Public School, who was quoted in today's Australian. He described the package as 'brilliant' and said that he looked forward to replacing the demountable library, which has been there since the original building burnt down several years ago. He said:It will give them a new sense of permanence and purpose _ That is extremely important. Not only that, it will result in an environment that is actually conducive to learning.These are the voices of people who are in touch with the needs of schools.Then, unfortunately, we have also heard the voices of those who are completely out of touch with the needs of schools. First and foremost is the Leader of the Opposition, who in his contribution earlier today rhetorically asked, 'Is the most urgent infrastructure deficiency requirement in Australian primary schools assembly halls and libraries?' Well, I suggest that he walk into any school in this country and talk to the principal, talk to the teachers and talk to the parents in that school and ask them what they think is important to the future of this nation. What they will say is important to the future of this nation is having a 21st century education system that invests in primary school students. The Leader of the Opposition wants to play some funny game about priorities. Well, the government are very proud to say that we think this nation's priority is its children. We think that this nation's highest priority is the next generation of Australians - our highest priority for economic prosperity, our highest priority for equity. We will unashamedly say that in every school in this country. Presumably, members of the Liberal Party will be walking into those schools saying, 'Kids aren't a priority,' because that is what the Leader of the Opposition believes.The Leader of the Opposition was not the only Liberal voice putting this position. We had the member for Higgins describing this $14.7 billion investment in Australian schools as a 'poor quality spend'. The only poor quality in relation to this announcement is the completely out of touch reaction of the Leader of the Opposition and his Liberal Party. They do not understand the importance of schools to Australia's future, they do not understand the importance of a first-class education for Australian school students to this nation's future and they are completely out of touch with principals, with teachers, with parents and with all those Australians who care about our future and who, most particularly, care about the education of Australia's kids.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition just cannot get it right. We project trend growth in that year; we do not forecast it in that year. Let us be very clear about that.An opposition member - What's the difference? - There is a very big difference. This is a very important time in the history of this nation. - One is a projection; the other has been modelled, of course. The economic illiteracy of those opposite is truly stunning. For the first time in the history of this country we have had a major political party and its leader come into this House and say that they intend to deliberately vote for higher unemployment. That is exactly what they have said. - The opposition do not believe that we need an economic stimulus, despite the fact that there has been such a substantial contraction in demand. They do not think, for example, that we need bonus payments targeted at lower income earners to boost consumption precisely at the time when this country needs it, when the world is throwing the worst that it can possibly throw at us. What this government is going to do is act to support jobs, and to do that we do need to have a temporary deficit, and that is provided for in the forward estimates. Our commitment to fiscal rigour over the long term remains. We have made it very clear in the UEFO that we intend to return to surplus as soon as we possibly can, consistent -  -  - It sounds like all those opposite know the date when world global conditions are going to normalise. Do you know that date? Of course you don't. So when growth returns to trend terms we will begin to move back to surplus. That is the responsible thing to do. Of course, moving back to surplus would not be helped by the approach of those opposite. We have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggest that the way to get future growth and future tax revenue is to give even bigger tax cuts. She said that bigger, permanent tax cuts would increase revenue. We would suggest that is a recipe for higher and higher deficits and for higher and higher borrowings. That is exactly what it is. It is interesting to look at what the Leader of the Opposition has had to say about her position on this. This is what he had to say this morning on ABC Radio. Interviewer: 'Can you explain Julie Bishop's suggestion on the weekend that you can increase your tax revenue by cutting your tax take?' Mr Turnbull: 'Well, this is um, this is um, um, a point. It's like a lot of economic, um, points. It has merit, but it isn't right, you know, in an extreme fall.' - The interviewer went on: 'Do you agree with Julie Bishop?' Mr Turnbull: 'Well, it, it, it, I simply, rather than, I'm not going to, to' -  -  - I was merely making the point that the opposition has a policy to send the budget into deeper deficit permanently. What we are doing, with a targeted stimulus, is to support jobs right now when they are needed. And we have made the point and we have made it publicly in the documentation that we published yesterday that, as soon as the economy recovers, as soon as the economy grows above trend, the government will take action to return the budget to surplus. That is as it should be.</DOC>

 - The Nation Building and Jobs Plan that we announced yesterday and, of course, the Economic Security Strategy that we put in place last October do demonstrate how Australia can get through this global recession in better shape than most other advanced economies, because we can use our strengths in fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate demand in this economy and to support jobs. That is precisely what we are doing, and that was precisely the intention of the Economic Security Strategy last October. If these retail trade figures today demonstrate anything, they demonstrate how out of touch the Leader of the Opposition and his entire frontbench are with what is actually happening in Australia, because, contrary to the Orwellian language of the Leader of the Opposition earlier, what these retail trade figures show is that the Economic Security Strategy gave a significant boost to demand in December last year, supporting employment, particularly in the retail sector. The December retail trade figures show that retail sales increased by 3.8 per cent in December. You know, that is the biggest monthly increase since August 2000. - But consider the backdrop to this, because it goes to the core of the inaccuracy of what the opposition has been saying in this place over the last 48 hours. - The backdrop to this is, in December, the sharpest contraction in global demand seen in the history of the modern market economy. In other countries around the world, what you saw were substantial falls in retail sales. If you go through them, in the US retail sales fell by 2.7 per cent in the month of December, in Japan sales fell by two per cent in December, in Germany they fell by 1.2 per cent and in the UK they fell by one per cent.It is also instructive to look at the data as to where the sales were biggest or where they increased the most, because there is this allegation from the other side that Australian families are out there wasting it; that is the implication of what they are saying. Let us just look at where it was spent: department stores had an increase of 8.3 per cent; clothing, 5.8 per cent -  - and other household goods, 9.9 per cent. This is occurring in the midst of the carnage on global stock markets and the collapse in demand and growth right around the world. This is a very substantial achievement, and it has been a very big boost to employment in this economy at a critical time for so many Australian families. I would say it certainly demonstrates the wisdom of the government's approach in targeting our assistance, particularly to those who are credit constrained and who are on lower incomes, and it demonstrates why most of the economists around the world and most of the official bodies back our view that making these payments to people who are credit constrained and on lower incomes, and doing it in a lump sum, works. It works. Of course, we get this from the IMF most particularly. Just look at what John Lipsky had to say on 17 November - he is the deputy chief of the IMF, the former chief economist. He said:For example, measures to support low-income households would be particularly helpful in boosting demand, and would be targeted at those most in need.You can even go to the Business Council of Australia and their budget submission, and I could go on and on -  - quoting economists around the world, including Nobel laureates, who provide a very sensible source of advice which common sense tells you is correct: if you target your support at those who need the assistance most then their propensity to spend will be highest. Of course, that is the orthodox position. It is not the position, of course, articulated by the Leader of the Opposition or by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It now brings us to this point, and it is very important to consider it in this light: by refusing to support the package that we have brought forward and by being so critical of the consumption measures that we have put in this package, if they were successful in their endeavours, they would leave a gaping hole in our economic defences against the contraction in demand that is occurring on a global basis. This government does not intend that to happen. We are intent on putting in place this jobs plan - this package to support employment in the Australian economy for Australians right now - and anyone who will not support it is simply supporting higher unemployment and is utterly irresponsible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question, and it does bring back into stark relief the Leader of the Opposition's proclamation of the Turnbull doctrine yesterday - that the thing about money is that you either spend it or save it, those essentially representing the two strategic options which are available. This government is not in the business, and can never be in the business, of forcing any individual consumer or taxpayer to deploy their funds in a particular way. What we can do, however, is assist the family budget by the practical measures that we outlined last year in the Economic Security Strategy and again as a part - one-quarter, in fact - of the nation-building plan that the government released yesterday.If individual households and consumers elect to spend then, of course, that directly assists sectors of the economy - such as retail, but other sectors as well - and therefore that supports employment directly. That is why there is such a strong body of advice from organisations around the world as to the virtue in employment terms of such measures. Secondly, however, if consumers elect to save in part, as many of them will, then that can have the effect of offsetting later decisions to return to spending. To give you a practical example, if someone is now electing, for example, to take part of the $950 cash bonus to make a temporary down payment or reduction in their credit card bill, that is a matter for them, but if that is their decision anyway then what that provides is a greater opportunity for that person to return to other levels of spending a little later on. These things do not exist as stark alternatives to each other.That is why a proper and rational response to the global economic recession and its impact on Australia is to have an entire armoury of measures, including those designed to support households, those designed to support consumption and those designed to support private residential construction - hence the first home buyers boost of last year and many of the construction related issues we announced yesterday, including the one-off extraordinary investment in 20,000 units of social housing. That is why we must also embrace, as part of our strategy, encouragement of business to resume decisions on private fixed capital investment - hence our decisions to bring in an accelerated temporary investment allowance. That is why, on top of that, we must also push the throttle into fast forward in the direct government investment in critical public infrastructure like schools, roads and other elements of transport and related infrastructure. A rational response to the impact of the global recession on the Australian economy must embrace all the elements that I have just referred to. It is not one or the other. That is the only way we can reduce the impact of this global recession on Australia. The alternative, as the member for North Sydney knows full well, is simply to let the free market rip. That is the alternative that the Australian people are confronted with. Our strategy is clear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and for the very hard work that he does for the families in his electorate, in that part of Tasmania. Yesterday there was some new hope for Australian families. Mums and dads can breathe just a little easier with the announcement of the government's $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. It is an economy-boosting plan from a government that is determined to take the decisive action needed to support families and jobs. Under the plan, 8.7 million taxpayers get a tax bonus of up to $950, 2.7 million school-age children attract a $950 back-to-school bonus, 1.5 million single-income family households get a $950 single-income family bonus and families relying on the housing and construction sectors could feel a little more confident knowing that 21,000 jobs are going to be supported by the government's investment in the social housing sector - $6.4 billion of investment.The Leader of the Opposition wants to kill that hope and confidence of Australian families. He does not care about the millions of jobs that will be under threat if families do not get these tax bonuses and payments. He does not care about stopping support for the 21,000 jobs in the housing and construction sector. Every single time an Australian parent loses their job, the Leader of the Opposition will need to answer to those parents about why he is opposing this Nation Building and Jobs Plan. All of us on this side of the House and many other Australians know exactly why the Leader of the Opposition is doing this: for base political purposes - no other.It must be a pretty lonely place over there. The Business Council of Australia right through to Anglicare all understand why this plan needs to be supported. The opposition has got this gravely and dangerously wrong. Just this morning - as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said so clearly today - we have got the final nail in the Leader of the Opposition's coffin, with the retail sales figures up by 3.8 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition might not have noticed, but these are the biggest monthly increases since August 2000. The figures do not lie. The economic strategy payments in December did their job, and the Leader of the Opposition should now make sure he supports the government's actions in our $42 billion package so that people can keep their jobs.</DOC>

 - They are so out of touch that they do not know what country they are living in. I can point to the success of the Economic Security Strategy of last October in Australia. I can say to the honourable member that the overwhelming research work that has been done around the world by the expert bodies studying this matter over the years, most notably the International Monetary Fund, is absolutely unambiguous in its recommendation for our approach. Not only do people like Nobel laureate Paul Krugman share this opinion, and not only is there a large body of economic opinion in the United States and Britain; this opinion is also shared by many people in this country. A recent budget submission given to the government said:Measures most likely to immediately impact demand are direct purchases of goods and services by government, and/or transfers directed to members of the community with a high propensity to spend.Who would that have come from? Could that have come from the ACTU? It came from the Business Council of Australia. This is accepted wisdom. The only people who do not accept it are those opposite, who are so terminally out of touch they cannot see the urgency involved here and the need to support Australian jobs and Australian industry.</DOC>

 - It is very important that this legislation passes the House this week. We have been advised by the tax commissioner and also by the chief executive of Centrelink that we do need key legislation through this House if the payments are to proceed through Centrelink in March and if the tax bonuses are to be paid by the tax office in April. That is just a fact. Given the urgency of what is occurring internationally, it is very important that there is no undue delay.I have seen the Leader of the Opposition today talk about what we should be doing instead of, for example, providing the tax bonus and some of the other payments. He suggests that what we should do instead is bring forward the 2009-10 tax cuts. That was one suggestion yesterday. If you were to take the Leader of the Opposition's suggestion, that would deliver $150 to a taxpayer on $30,000 - only $150. There is no stimulus there. That is $800 less than our tax bonus that we will deliver in April. If you are talking about someone on $65,000, he only wants to deliver in that period $150 - once again, $800 less than the tax bonus that we will deliver in April. Of course, he would deliver, through his proposition, $2,150 to a taxpayer on $200,000. That is a real indicator of the priorities of the Leader of the Opposition.I think because I pointed out this mistake to him yesterday he changed his tune in the House today. I think in the House today he suggested that they would be in favour of bringing forward the tax cuts from 2010-11. I think that is what he said in the House today. If his proposal were to be adopted, that would result in $300 to a taxpayer on $30,000 - $650 less than the bonus that we would provide in April. But, for somebody on $200,000, that would deliver $3,450 to that taxpayer - $3,450 more than they would receive through our temporary bonus.But it is worse than that, because it goes to the point that I made to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition earlier, because they are arguing in favour of permanent tax cuts. If the proposition to bring forward the 2010-11 tax cuts were put and implemented by the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition's proposed tax bring-forward would cost $11 billion, on a permanent basis - hence my observation earlier that they are in favour of higher deficits permanently.</DOC>

It is the case that we do have reciprocal social security agreements with other countries and payments are made to Australians living overseas, and other countries have payments made to their residents living here. I do have a long memory, because I have a memory of a time when the member who asked the question was actually a minister for social security in this House. I think you will find he might have negotiated some of those agreements. I think that is the case.

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question and her ongoing interest in transport and infrastructure development, including in her electorate. The package that is before the House today provides an additional $90 million for the Black Spot Program. The Black Spot Program improves safety right around the nation. For every dollar spent, there is a far greater saving due to the fall in health costs from accident reduction and in terms of efficiencies on our roads. This will fund an additional 350 projects. It brings spending on black spots to over $250 million over the next two years, more than double what the former government was planning to spend over the same period.We are also providing an additional $150 million for repairing and maintaining regional roads. In order to do all this, of course, we need to get the package that is before the House passed. You would expect the National Party to at least be supporting regional road projects. If nothing else, you would expect them to be supporting that. But the Leader of the National Party, the shadow minister for transport, has already made his contribution to this debate and he has dismissed the $150 million. Indeed he has called it 'a paltry effort'. He has said:You could spend all of that on one road in my electorate and you still would not have caught up on the maintenance backlog just for that road.Who was the minister who presided over the maintenance backlog? Who was the minister for transport in the former government? He and his Nationals colleagues presided over massive cuts in road funding, including a cut of 35 per cent. In 2005-06 it was $4.3 billion, down to $2.8 billion in 2006-07 - a cut of 35 per cent in road funding. So out of touch are they with people who used to be a part of the constituency that they engaged in. This is what people in the sector have had to say about the package put forward under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Wendy Machin, President of the NRMA, said yesterday:The NRMA warmly welcomes this additional funding, particularly the fact that a substantial proportion of the money will be immediately available to be spent this financial year.Trevor Martyn, of the Australian Trucking Association, said:We are very pleased the Government has looked beyond tomorrow's headlines and is putting money into fixing the roads and making them safer.Every road user will benefit from the Government's plan.The fact is that the opposition are just so out of touch. It is all about them; it is all about the politics. The Leader of the Opposition is more concerned about protecting his own position as Leader of the Opposition than he is about defending the interests of the nation. The default position, because his party room is just so divided, is to come in here and simply say, 'We will oppose the whole package.' They stand condemned, they stand isolated from their own base, they stand isolated from their own communities, and over coming days, weeks and months there will be a real political price to pay for the political opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. The answer to the shadow minister's question is in fact obvious. The government is engaged in the economic security strategy in this Nation Building and Jobs Plan to promote economic activity and to support jobs. As the Prime Minister has said on more than one occasion, we are in difficult times. But what we can certainly say about the economic security statement and about this Nation Building and Jobs Plan is that it will support economic growth and consequently support jobs. Whilst we are in difficult economic times, clearly the nation will be in a better position with this stimulus in our economy than if the nation followed the lead of the Leader of the Opposition and the members of the Liberal Party, who have taken a conscious decision today to come into this parliament and to vote for higher unemployment - to come into this parliament and vote against nation-building propositions, including the biggest historic spend on our schools in this nation's history. That is what the Liberal Party have chosen to do.The Treasurer, during the course of question time, has taken the Liberal Party to the evidence from the retail trade figures about the difference that the Economic Security Strategy made. If members of the Liberal Party are so economically naive, so economically incompetent that they cannot reason from those figures into understanding that stimulus packages make a difference to economic activity and stimulus packages consequently make a difference to and support jobs, then really I do wonder what hope there is for them. I would have to say to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he cannot explain that basic economics to his frontbench, one does wonder what skills you need to be a merchant banker.</DOC>

 - The government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan is designed to push back hard against the very powerful negative economic forces emerging from overseas that are causing major problems for the Australian economy and at the same time to leave a legacy of new and upgraded infrastructure for the future of Australians. The individual payments that we are committed to will hit the Australian economy first in March and April but will continue to flow through for some months thereafter because people may in some cases save initially and spend subsequently. The investment in insulation of Australian homes, in schools and in housing will ensure that we rebuild the infrastructure of this nation, both the community infrastructure and the productive infrastructure, for the benefit of future generations.It is legitimate to ask what exactly across-the-board permanent tax cuts favouring wealthy people would do for future generations in terms of productive infrastructure and community infrastructure. How are they going to improve the productivity of this nation? Yesterday I reminded the House of the infamous statement by the member for Curtin on Sunday where she advised that the coalition's response was 'broad and sweeping tax cuts that will increase the tax base and increase tax revenues'. As I have already pointed out, this is based on the discredited theory of Professor Arthur Laffer that if you actually cut taxes that will mean tax revenues grow. I note the Leader of the Opposition's response to that in a radio interview where he stumbled, he bumbled, he weaved and he ducked but he was unable to avoid saying that he kind of agrees sometimes with his own deputy leader, his own shadow Treasurer. There were lots of, 'Well, it, it', 'Simply this' and 'I am not going to' -  - There is another element in the statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that warrants some examination too. That is the reference to 'increase the tax base'. Increasing the tax base means one thing, which is that you start taxing things that currently are not taxed. That is what the former government did by introducing the GST. That is what 'increase the tax base' actually means. I note that the opposition, who are today making such an issue of deficits, are saying that their alternative strategy outlined this morning by the Leader of the Opposition involves a stimulus package of $15 billion minimum. When on radio today the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked, 'If you were going to spend $15 billion in a recovery package, would that send the Australian economy into deficit?' her answer was: 'It would balance it in fact at this point.' Not only has she not caught up with the $115 billion collapse in government revenues that the Prime Minister announced on Monday, but even if you measured this against the projections in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook paper published in mid-November you would see that this statement is 100 per cent wrong. She cannot even add up, because the stimulus package they propose would take the budget into deficit even without the recent updated analysis of the collapse in tax revenues.The statements from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition lead to one of two conclusions: either the opposition has a strategy to impose new taxes, perhaps by broadening the GST and putting it back on food as it always wanted to do, or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has absolutely no idea what she is talking about. Those are the two options. I concede that there is quite a bit of evidence to support the second hypothesis, but having been in this place for a while I am a bit of a cynical type and I am a bit more suspicious. I tend to believe that, in politics, where there is a little bit of smoke there is going to be fire.I note with interest that in late January the Deputy Leader of the Opposition also said that one of the first things the opposition would do in response to the global financial crisis was revisit industrial relations laws. I wonder what that is a reference to? I believe in watching what people do in politics. What we have really seen hinted at by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and walked away from to a degree for public presentation purposes by the Leader of the Opposition, is the real traditional Liberal Party strategy, which is tax cuts for the wealthy, an increase in the GST's scope and bringing back Work Choices. That is the strategy of the opposition.The government reject these approaches because we are investing in the long-term infrastructure needs of this nation. We are getting spending moving into the pockets of ordinary families to ensure that the retail sector and the ordinary small businesses of this country can continue to grow to sustain jobs and growth.</DOC>

 - The government stands unapologetically for an education revolution in Australia. -  - I thought that would get them going! We stand for an education revolution in terms of what we build in our schools - our primary schools, secondary schools, TAFEs and universities - and in our research. We believe in that because we need to equip this nation for the 21st century economy.I said yesterday that when I said at the last election we needed to prepare for that day when the mining boom was over those opposite when they were in government scoffed and laughed. That was a little more than a year ago. Guess what? The mining boom is over. What they did for 12 years was turn their backs on developing the knowledge base of the economy to deal with the challenges of the 21st century. This seems to have escaped the attention of the member for skirt -  -  - that is, the member for Sturt - in the midst of what I think must be an interesting set of arrangements at the moment in terms of his loyalties between the member for Wentworth and the member for Higgins. We will just think about that for a minute. - A key part of the education revolution is to ensure that our kids have access to the digital education revolution of the 21st century. That means that all kids, not just those in the richest and flasher schools, have an opportunity to participate in the information economy of tomorrow. That means that we have to work hard to do it. What those opposite did, when they had 12 years to act, was simply push it all into the too-hard basket. Nothing happened on high-speed broadband; nothing happened on a rollout of effective computer access within our schools.When it comes to trades training centres in schools, as we have gone around the country we have seen capital infrastructure in our secondary schools which has not been updated for 30 or 40 years. This is a disgrace. We need to invest to fix it. Adding to that, we have sought, with the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which we outlined yesterday, to add language laboratories, science wings, 21st century libraries and multipurpose halls to our schools. This is part of building the best education system that this nation can possibly have. We will honour our pre-election commitments on trades training centres and on computers in schools as given.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and make the point that the global financial crisis is having a huge impact on trade flows around the world and, despite the fact that Australia posted a strong trade surplus yesterday, we will not be immune. The reason for that is that six out of our top 10 trading partners are already in recession. The IMF is forecasting that trade flows will decline this year by 2.8 per cent, and we are seeing very worrying trends in terms of reversion to protectionist policies, most evidenced by the dairy decision in the EC and the 'buy America' campaign emanating from the US congress - both measures which we have strongly opposed.Because we are not immune, we as a government have to act decisively here as well as in international fora in arguing and taking action for a positive and constructive path forward. That is why yesterday's $42 billion jobs and nation-building package is an essential part of our response not just for what matters here in this country but also in terms of a global call for those countries that are in a position to spend and inject a fiscal stimulus to do so. The IMF has called for countries that are in that position to spend at least two per cent of their GDP. Yesterday we also saw the Reserve Bank responding not just to the circumstances here but also to the urgings of banking authorities for the central banks to ease interest rate pressures.Our endeavours in international fora to free up trade are so important to this coordinated approach. The reason for that is simple. It is because trade itself is a stimulus. That is because historically world trade has grown faster than world output. Each time that there has been a successful conclusion to a trade round, that multiplier has increased. So the point that we make is this: what is the point in a coordinated approach to fiscal stimulus unless you are prepared to work on the multiplier as well? That is why we have been advocating the conclusion of the Doha Round not only in the forums of the WTO but also through the G20.This is a government that has responded and acted in terms of a coordinated action. But who is standing against that action in this country? Those who sit opposite, because they would oppose the stimulus message and the stimulus calls from the international organisations to which Australia has responded. The opposition's action is irresponsible. It not only flies in the face of what has been called for globally but also condemns Australian working families to the worst excesses of what will happen out of this global recession.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question because it allows us to take the opportunity to remind the House about the very significant investments that have already been made in health in the last 14 months, in contrast to the approach taken by the previous government, which used to rip money out of the public hospital system. So let me just recap in case any members have forgotten over the Christmas break about the $64 billion of health investment - a 50 per cent increase on the previous government in this healthcare agreement.I do not hear anybody saying that a 50 per cent increase on the previous government's healthcare agreement is an underinvestment in health. I did not hear any criticism about $1.1 billion going into the workforce. I did not hear any criticism when we put $750 million on the table for emergency departments across the country - something those opposite never did. I did not hear any objection from constituents in the electorates of those opposite and in the electorates of our members when we committed to putting $600 million into elective surgery. I can report to the House that 35,000 procedures -  - I will get to the question of the Dubbo hospital in a moment. Let me first report to the House that I have not heard people complaining about the extra 35,000-plus procedures - hips, knees, cataracts - that were paid for by this government's investments in its first days in office, which have now been delivered across the country. That is more than was promised.Let me go particularly to the question of the Dubbo hospital, because it is a very bad situation. In answer to previous questions in the House I have made clear that we do not apologise and are not apologists for what is clearly an inadequate situation at that hospital. I would like to read a quote to the House, because it seems that sometimes those opposite do not like to hear my views on these things, but I wondered whether they might like to hear the member for Dickson's view and his comments last week on 2SM. - It will be very interesting for those opposite, because he said:The issues at Dubbo hospital of course have been around for a while. The hospital and the public health issues in general have been around, frankly, for the last 10 years.We have done more in the last year than you ever did! - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I know that he is deeply interested in education in his electorate. Can I say to the member for Moreton and to all members in this parliament that our investment of $14.7 billion into our new program, Building the Education Revolution - a historic investment in every primary school, every secondary school and every special school in this country - offers opportunities for those members who are in touch with the local schools in their community to assist. Of course, members who are in touch with their local schools know what their local schools' infrastructure needs are and they know that local principals, teachers and parents have seen yesterday's announcement and now want to start working it through. Members of parliament who are in touch with their local communities can play a role in getting that information to school communities. I would recommend that those members visit the Building the Education Revolution section of my department's website, where they will find fact sheets to assist schools to work out how they will benefit from this program.The benefits of this program for local schools are enormous, as are the opportunities for supporting local jobs as people go about the construction, repair and maintenance activities that will be financed by this historic new investment in schools. The government are anxious to work with in-touch local members on this program and we are anxious to work with those who want to assist with the rollout of the program. In that regard I would refer to the statement by the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Mr Colin Barnett, who said:The Federal Government's plan - that is, our Nation Building and Jobs Plan - emphasises the areas of housing and education, two areas that I am confident the Western Australian Government can help to deliver _The Liberal Treasurer in Western Australia, Mr Buswell, said:That type of stimulus, whether it impacts on consumption expenditure or investment, is something that the state government welcomes.Those people are clearly prepared to work with the federal government in delivering these new investments for Australian schools and more broadly through our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Of course, there are those members of parliament who are so out of touch with the needs of their local school communities that they are opposed to this $14.7 billion investment in schools to make sure that they are able to meet the needs of the 21st century and offer a world-class education.Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition was inviting members of parliament to imagine what they would say when looking into the eyes of schoolchildren as they talked to them about Australian politics and about matters that involve the Australian nation. In-touch members of parliament will be able to say that we are making a historic investment in their schools and their future. Out-of-touch members of parliament from the Liberal Party, who are voting against it, presumably will say that they were members of a government that used to have a program called Investing in Our Schools, which they brought to an end by way of prime ministerial press release on 19 February 2007, and that they then contested an election in 2007 without promising one dollar more to that program. In his response today, the Leader of the Opposition floated an idea that maybe $3 billion could be put into that program but failed to explain that that is an 80 per cent cut on what the Rudd Labor government is committed to - a Nation Building and Jobs Plan for every school in the country as opposed to the Liberal Party's Investing in Our Schools Program, brought to an end by the then Prime Minister by way of media release on 19 February 2007.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government has been working its way through a range of options to try and assist the small business community across Australia, who are bearing the brunt of this global economic crisis. Small business is extremely important. It generates employment of a large order of magnitude across the country. There are millions of small businesses. Each of our communities is well represented by the men and women of small business who are out there, often putting their houses on the line in support of their small businesses and generating jobs for themselves and incomes to support their families.These small business men and women have not caused this crisis - not one bit. It has been caused by other factors which have been the subject of debate here and elsewhere. The practical question we face is: how can we support those businesses? What we have done so far is implement a range of measures which assist - they do not remove or eliminate the impact on them of the global economic recession but they assist - in reducing that impact. One of those measures has been derided almost universally by those opposite, and I refer here to the measures that we have taken to support private consumption. Small business operators, as the honourable member will know from the Gold Coast, are very much concentrated - not exclusively - in the retail sector. Therefore, when you provide direct stimulus to consumption, it flows through in large part to retail.The statistics referred to by the Treasurer before, about what happened with the retail sales figures at the end of last year, reflect therefore a direct flowthrough to small business operators. It is not the end of the story. It means that more measures must be taken, but we are acutely conscious that small businesses, out there at the front arm of retail, are bearing so much of the brunt of this impact, and therefore our direct support for consumption last year and this year is of direct relevance to them. Secondly, when it comes to the stability of the financial system and the ability of banks to provide credit at all - and I will go to the question of the extent to which banks are properly providing credit to small business in a minute - the first and foremost responsibility of this government, given the extraordinary events of last September and October, was to ensure the continued stability of the financial system, period. In this country, our overwhelming focus has been on what we need to do to make sure that Australia's main commercial banks remain viable into the future. If you look across the world at what has happened with the mainstream banks and other major Western economies as they have fallen like ninepins, you will see that 30 of them either have collapsed or have had to be bailed out by governments. That is of fundamental and continuing concern to this government, hence the actions we took - which were, in large part, opposed by those opposite - in the double guarantees that we provided both to depositors and to banks for interbank lending. Why we provided support for interbank lending -  - I will come to the measure announced yesterday, which relates to the accelerated investment allowance, once I have described the impact of supporting banks and their ability to provide credit, period. You see, the debate in this parliament about what we do on stimulus is important. It goes to the questions of government direct action in supporting jobs and also government direct action in building necessary infrastructure in our schools and elsewhere. But, in the overall global scheme of things, what happens with the normalisation of private credit markets is of fundamental importance. If we do not get that right globally then stimulus can only do so much - even macroeconomic global stimulus, including both fiscal and monetary policy measures. It is getting global credit markets operating again which is so fundamental to allowing credit to flow again at a reasonable price to small business borrowers as well. That is why we are so actively engaged in the whole exercise of ensuring the continued stability of our major banks and our overall financial system.Also, what has been criticised by those opposite is our direct engagement in a measure with the banks to support the private commercial property market. Those opposite need to reflect on this: in the event of the withdrawal of foreign participation in the syndication associated with the commercial property markets - as the Leader of the Opposition audibly groans - what you are effectively signing up to by opposing that is to allow the collapse in asset values of so many of the major companies of this country who have substantial investments in the commercial property sector. That sector alone employs some 150,000 people and a number of small business contractors directly affected by any such collapse in their asset values, of which the 'member for merchant banking', otherwise called the Leader of the Opposition, seems to be completely oblivious and disregarding.On the measure that we announced yesterday, which goes to the investment allowance, we have specifically embraced measures to reduce the overall threshold at which small business can apply for their handling through the measure that we have embraced. Before, the threshold was $10,000; now it has been reduced to $1,000. We have also increased the actual amount from 10 per cent to 30 per cent. We are acutely mindful of the decisions which small businesses must make. On the supply of credit and the cost of credit to small businesses, as I also said yesterday, we will remain heavily engaged with the banking sector to do whatever we physically can to support the proper flow of private credit to small businesses as they need it.Small business, together with other sectors of the economy, is critical and represents a critical focus of what the government seeks to do. We are engaged in a grave debate in this parliament about how Australia should respond to this global economic crisis. What stuns me about the debate today and the position taken by the Leader of the Liberal Party is that the Liberals, demonstrating how much they have lost touch with the Australian community and economy, are now threatening in the Senate to block tax bonuses to 8.7 million Australians, to block the biggest single building program across Australia - 7½ thousand primary schools - and frankly, they should reconsider their position.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Capricornia. I know that she has been very concerned about recent job losses in the mining sector and she is very concerned to keep construction strong in Capricornia. The Nation Building and Jobs Plan, released yesterday, includes a historic investment in social housing which will have benefits right across the nation: in areas like hers; in regional centres; in rural and remote areas; and in suburbs and cities. Right across this nation, we will be building 20,000 new homes and renovating another 2½ thousand run-down homes in order to make them liveable again. This is the largest single investment in social housing ever made by an Australian government. The package will help us meet our targets on homelessness and provide affordable housing for low-income Australians who are struggling in the private rental market. We have had - unremarkably, I suppose - very strong endorsements from the community and welfare sector. The Council to Homeless Persons has said, 'This is great news for the more than 100,000 Australians who are homeless.' The Brotherhood of St Laurence has said:_ we haven't seen this kind of government investment in social housing for decades. Not only will it bring lasting benefit in terms of protecting construction jobs but it will also boost the stock of affordable housing for disadvantaged Australians now and into the future.ACOSS have said, 'We are delighted that social housing has been given a much needed boost.'It is also the fact that this package makes great economic sense. It will support jobs in the housing and construction industry. The Housing Industry Association says:_ the spot purchase of private sector new dwellings will provide a rapid and necessary boost to economic activity. It will activate the commencement of many approved private sector dwellings that have stalled due to a lack of working capital _The Property Council of Australia says:Every dollar that goes into the construction sector has a multiplier effect  -  it is spent three times over in the economy _ This makes for an ideal measure of a well thought-out stimulus package.The Residential Development Council says:In committing this money to the sector, the government is ensuring projects that are already in the development pipeline are built, and more importantly that new projects get off the ground, which is difficult in the current market.This measure is right for our economy. It is right for building our nation in the long term. The opposition's decision to block these measures will be a blow to the many low-income Australians who are struggling to put a roof over their heads, and it will be a blow to the construction sector: to all those tradies, small businesses and building supply companies that are struggling to keep their heads above water and struggling to keep their apprentices employed. The responsible and compassionate thing to do is pass these measures now.</DOC>

 - I guess there are a few things that you can take from that question. The first thing you can take is that the $3 billion cut by the previous Howard government from social housing is their continuing policy. The fact is that, if funding had continued on the trajectory that it had been on under the previous Labor government, we would have 90,000 extra public housing homes in this country today. We have got 100,000 homeless Australians on any given night. If we had continued on the previous trajectory, there would have been 90,000 extra public housing dwellings. We will put that to one side! That does not matter!The honourable member has asked why we would not spend extra money on building private housing. He may have missed the fact that we have set aside $623 million for a National Rental Affordability Scheme. He may have missed the fact that we have set aside $1½ billion for a first home owner boost - increasing the first home owners grant to $14,000 for existing properties and $21,000 for newly built properties. And what do people in the development and construction sectors tell me? They tell me that they are relying on these first home buyers - who are walking in off the street with the confidence to buy, for the first time in many years, because interest rates are low and the first home owner boost is giving them confidence - to keep themselves working. - I will conclude by saying it is ironic in the extreme that a party that ignored housing policy for over a decade, and that presided over a growth in our homeless population at a time of economic prosperity, should raise this issue in this way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. I know that she takes a keen and acute interest in the policy matters that we are bringing forward for people in her electorate. As the House would be aware, as part of the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan, we have committed $3.9 billion for the Energy Efficient Homes program, which will roll out energy efficiency to Australian suburbs on an unprecedented scale, providing immediate support for green jobs and driving demand in clean and green industries through insulation and hot water. Critically, the Energy Efficient Homes program will also help relieve cost-of-living pressures for nearly three million Australian homes because it will reduce people's energy bills for years to come. There will be a significant saving of 49 million tonnes CO2 equivalent by 2020, akin to taking one million cars off the road. I was asked what support there is for the Energy Efficient Homes program and am pleased to say that the response has been overwhelmingly positive. One insulation fitter on ABC Radio yesterday said:Our own company had to lay off a shift in one of our plants just before Christmas. We'll be putting that shift back on.That is exactly what the Energy Efficient Homes program is about. I am also happy to read what the Clean Energy Council had to say about the package:Insulation saves energy, money, jobs and the environment - so it's a win-win-win-win. These sorts of packages help every Australian by cushioning the cost of transition to a carbon constrained economy.That is exactly what the Energy Efficient Homes program is about. Master Builders of Australia said:This initiative will help support much needed jobs in the building industry, while at the same time assist in reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions and saving energy costs._            _            _Boosting the building industry is a proven formula for reviving economies and stimulating jobs growth.There was this recognition from the Climate Institute:There's no question that insulation and solar hot water are at the top of the list in improving the energy wastage and carbon pollution from our homes _And so the statements of support for the government's announcement yesterday go on. These positive responses show exactly what the Energy Efficient Homes program is all about. This is the right package at the right time, and these programs are already open for business. This is action on an unprecedented scale, with insulation to around 2.7 million Australian households, including half a million rental homes. By increasing the solar hot water rebate from $1,000 to $1,600 and removing the means test, we are harnessing Australia's abundant sunshine for a true solar revolution in Australia's suburbs.We heard another endorsement today not from a third party but, as it turned out, from the party opposite. This is in fact what the Leader of the Opposition said about the government's rollout of insulation:We welcome the government paying attention to _ insulation.We then got some overblown criticism, ignoring the fact that the Liberals did nothing for some 12 years, before he went on to say:The $1,600 subsidy will _ mean that over 90 per cent of jobs would be completed at no cost to the owner.I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that that is exactly the point. The $1,600 subsidy that the Rudd government will provide for ceiling insulation means that over 90 per cent of jobs will be completed at no cost to the owner. That is the point of this particular measure. He went on to say:The subsidy is not means tested. We would support an insulation subsidy of a lower amount, and I would suggest for the government's consideration one that is, for example, $500 for all houses, increasing to $1,000 subject to a means test _ A similar approach could be taken to solar hot water.That is quite incredible. What must the member for Flinders be thinking after spending most of last year asserting the great injustice of a means-test on the $8,000 rebate for solar PV, a rebate that continues to run at record levels despite the member jumping out of an aeroplane saying it was in free fall? The Leader of the Opposition is now trying to means-test a package that is all about value for money, delivering energy efficiency savings for nearly three million Australian households on an unprecedented level and driving demand for green jobs. The opposition has lost the plot. It is time it supported this bill.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I point out to him that this government is providing record funding when it comes to aged care of $41 billion over the next four years. That is in comparison to 12 years of neglect by the previous government. The other side is always talking down the aged-care sector. The honourable member referred to the latest aged-care approvals round, in which we had very healthy and competitive numbers of people applying for those places right throughout the country. Indeed, when it came to high care we had a huge amount. When it came to community care, we had a 10 to one oversubscription. What that shows is there is a huge interest from providers when it comes to applying for those particular places. - So I thank the member for pointing out the latest round of ACAR, in which we have a major oversubscription and in which we are seeing major capital grants to our aged-care providers throughout the country. As I said at the beginning, this government is committed to providing aged-care services for our older Australians. We had 12 years of neglect from those opposite. What we are doing is providing record funding - $41 billion over the next four years. We are doing that to provide services to our older Australians right throughout this country where they need and deserve them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman, who certainly does understand that older Australians who have worked very hard all their lives are feeling the pressure of the global financial crisis. It is the case that older Australians are amongst the millions who will benefit from the government's $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Those self-funded retirees who paid tax in 2007-08 as a result of their investments or other income will receive the $950 tax bonus. Part pensioners who paid even one dollar in tax last financial year will also receive the $950 tax bonus. That means that around 290,000 older Australians, self-funded retirees and part pensioners can expect to benefit. This, of course, is on top of the benefits that were paid to both pensioners and self-funded retirees back in December. Those Economic Security Strategy payments went to four out of five of the 2.8 million Australians aged over 65 - both pensioners and self-funded retirees.Very importantly, many pensioners who are suffering in the private rental market will benefit from the government's $6.4 billion investment in social housing. Many pensioners in the private rental market are under severe housing stress, and we certainly hope that some of them will be able to benefit from the 20,000 extra homes that will be built. This support builds on many other initiatives that the government put in place last year for older Australians. These figures are very important for everybody to be aware of. In total - and this is excluding the normal indexation that pensioners receive - the government has provided an additional $2,337 of assistance to single pensioners and $3,537 to pensioner couples - all that in the year since we came into office. We are also committed to delivering long-term pension reform, and that has been recognised by the National Seniors chief executive officer, Michael O'Neill, who yesterday said:I think the relief has come already, and there will be a further lot of relief with the reform in May in the budget.Unfortunately for older Australians there is only one thing standing in the way of them benefiting from this Nation Building and Jobs Plan, and that of course is the opposition. It is the opposition that is going to prevent self-funded retirees and part pensioners getting the tax bonus that we have proposed. They also seem to want to stop those pensioners who are under severe financial stress in the private rental market from getting the help that they need. That demonstrates just how out of touch the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party are. They have no intention of making sure that older Australians get the help they need.</DOC>

 - The question just asked by the member for Dunkley reminds me of all of the questions on national economic infrastructure posed today by those opposite. It begs one fundamental question: what did you do for 12 years? What did you do on broadband for 12 years? What did you do on building our schools for 12 years? What did you do on building our hospitals for 12 years? What did you do when the investment in our universities went backwards rather than forwards? What did you do to make sure that our research infrastructure was in fact world-class? The answer to the above: nothing, nothing, next to nothing, nothing and nothing. - On the question of infrastructure, including broadband infrastructure, the government will stand by each and every one of its pre-election commitments. These are vital to the nation for the 21st century. Our vision for the nation is to ensure that we have 21st century infrastructure.This government stands for nation building; those opposite are for sitting on their hands. That is the alternative. Again, I say to those opposite, including to the leader of the Liberal Party: the Liberal Party, by its decision today to block this nation building plan in the Senate, has demonstrated how out of touch they have become with all Australians and with the needs of the Australian economy and Australian families.So out of touch have they become that they have no mind whatsoever as to who will pay the price of this global economic recession. I will tell you who will not be paying the price: the merchant bankers. Who will be paying the price will be those who are out there depending on this government to act, in order to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of private sector activity, by assisting with the measures that we have announced. We have already underlined, through the statements the government made yesterday, those who will benefit from the package the government has put forward. But those who will pay the price for this action taken by the leader of the Liberal Party today are the mums and dads who, every day, are facing the challenges of paying back-to-school expenses, those out there who are waiting for decent primary school facilities and those out there who expect their governments to act, not just to waive through the recession onto their shoulders.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question and for her ongoing support for the Business Enterprise Centre in Launceston and the small business community more generally. I can advise the House that the response of the small business community to the plan announced yesterday has been extremely positive. Indeed, the Council of Small Business of Australia described the plan as:_ a confidence boost for small business that will provide benefit to many small businesses and to the communities in which they live and operate.We have heard from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia. What do they say? They describe it as, 'A timely shot in the arm for small business.' They say:The $2.7 billion tax bonus - that has been criticised by the coalition - is an important and timely investment in the lifeblood of the Australian economy - small business.The New South Wales Business Chamber has said that this is 'a shot in the arm for the New South Wales economy'. It said:New South Wales businesses will particularly welcome the $2.7 billion package of tax breaks for business.What do we hear from the Master Builders Association of Australia? They have said:The building industry is predominantly made up of small businesses which should benefit from the Government's $2.7 billion Small Business and General Tax break _The point they are making is that this is a plan for tradies. This is a plan for the tradespeople of Australia. As the Prime Minister said during question time and again this morning, 'What have you got against the contractors and the tradespeople of Australia?' You are supposed to be supporting small business - the tradies and the contractors - but you are opposing each and every one of these measures.What do the National Farmers Federation have to say? In support of the package, they say:Further, the $2.7 billion tax break for small businesses _ will be greatly appreciated by those small family-owned farms.Well, it would be appreciated if we could get the legislation through the parliament. The Restaurant and Catering Industry Association has said:The small business tax break _ may just be what our small businesses need to convince them to buy that new piece of equipment in the market.There you go, the member for Moncrieff! Very importantly, on the question of spending, it also said:Consumers now spend nearly 10 per cent of their household income on meals out, on average, and these additional payments, which will come just prior to the next school holidays - if we can get them through the parliament - will be spent in restaurants and cafes.So there is the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association. The fact is that the only critics of this plan are members of the opposition. The criticism was led last night by the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, who formally began his campaign for the leadership yesterday and last night. Members of the opposition are always taking an each-way bet, a bob each way. I will bet that there is a very big chance - and I will back it on the nose - that the member for Higgins, the former Treasurer, will be the Leader of the Opposition by -  - I am responding to the decision of the opposition to oppose this package. The temporary opposition leader is condemning the Australian people to more hardship, to more job losses, to more people losing their homes and to more people losing their businesses. He is completely out of touch with the needs of the Australian people and he is completely out of touch with the needs of small business. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to put aside his personal short-term political interests to support the small business community of Australia, to support the Australian people and to support the Australian national interest by passing this package.</DOC>

 - They really are a bunch of beauts, aren't they? On infrastructure? In 12 years, nothing; one year, fix the lot. That is terrific. One year, fix the lot - cranes out across the country. But there are a few things that you have to go through. One is called the tendering process. - On the question of infrastructure, let us all bring close to mind the absolute debacle in the Senate last year when those opposite sought to vote on the nation-building legislation. Do you remember that? I notice the honourable member who has just interjected, who is from the great state of Western Australia. I thought that, after 12 years of umpteen studies by those opposite about partnering with the Western Australian government on the future development of the Ord, this government, uniquely, has now said to the Liberal government of Western Australia, 'We're going to be partners with you in that development.' That is why I went up to Kununurra with the Liberal Premier of Western Australia - because we are going to get on with the business of developing the great north-west, as opposed to those who twiddle their thumbs year on year on year.Furthermore, I would say to the member for Goldstein in answer to his question: on two occasions last year we advanced two blocks of half a billion dollars to the universities of Australia to advance much-needed capital works. That work is now underway - from planning processes and the rollout of project work. We did the same in the stimulus package last year - half a billion dollars released also to the TAFE sector of the country to do the same. I would suggest to the member for Goldstein that he also pay attention to the other contents of the $4.6 billion nation-building program that we released last December, including the massive investment in the Australian rail freight corporation, and to what will happen to the Australian rail freight network across the country. These are decisions which have already been taken, and we support each one of them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for the question. He is a member who is well in touch with the farmers in his electorate. It is critical that the government invest in long-term nation-building projects in rural and regional Australia in order to support jobs and boost long-term growth. We referred yesterday to the reaction from the NFF as one of the first farmers organisations to explain their view of how this would affect farmers in need. They said:The Government's $950 tax-free bonus for all drought-affected farmers - reaching some 21,500 farmers in need - will be a much-needed fillip to families and regional economies.But the most extraordinary thing has not been the positive reaction from the farmers; the most extraordinary thing has been the reaction from some of the people within this chamber - because, while the member for Flynn understands that there are 550 farming families in need in his electorate who will receive the $950 payment, I think people were astonished when the member for Wide Bay decided to announce that the more than 130 farming families who would receive the $950 payment in his electorate were going to be told that he would come in here and vote against the $950 payment for those 130 farming families in his electorate. But maybe it is because he did not consult fully with the other members of the National Party and Liberal Party in this chamber who have many more than 130 families who will receive the benefit but who have now been committed to come into this chamber and vote against them receiving that benefit. Did he consult with the member for Parkes, who has more than 800 farming families in his electorate for whom he is going to walk in here and vote that they not get the $950? Did he consult with the member for Murray, who has more than 1,900 farming families in her electorate and who will come in here and vote against it? Did he think for a moment about the electorate of Mallee and the extraordinary challenges that are evident in areas like Mildura, where there are more than 2,150 farming families who will receive the $950 payment - yet he will vote against it? But the members for Flynn, for Blair, for Eden-Monaro, for Wakefield, for Ballarat, for Bendigo and for Corangamite will come in here and defend the farming families in their electorates?Did he think about the member for Gippsland, who campaigned during his by-election that he would support the upgrade of the Maffra Secondary College - yet, when money is going to come forward to help fund an upgrade at Maffra Secondary College, he has been committed now to come in here and vote against it? Maybe the member for Gippsland ought to have a look over his shoulder at someone who was elected in the by-election in another part of Australia on the same day, because the member for Lyne campaigned vigorously for the upgrade of Laurieton primary school, and he will be able to come in here, defend his local primary school and vote in favour of it. There are three political parties in this room. The political party in this room that represents the fewest country seats is, without surprise, the National Party. There is a reason for that.</DOC>

 - When it comes to leadership from the Australian Liberal Party, it seems we must turn to the Liberal leader of Western Australia alone, who, today, with every Premier in the country and the chief ministers of the two territories, agreed to a new national plan to implement this national stimulus package and, furthermore, decided to pitch in and do their bit to support this economy, families and jobs, given the global economic recession which is unfolding.I would say this to the Leader of the Opposition: that is what leadership is about. And I would draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the following: that on votes relating to legislation, which occurred on 116 occasions during the last term of the Howard government, the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard, was absent on 110 occasions.</DOC>

 - What we have seen in the last 24 hours are two approaches to national leadership - one which says that we should put aside our party political differences, put aside the differences between federal and state governments and work together in the national interest. That is what has been at work since nine o'clock this morning over there at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments - governments, federal and state, governments, Labor and Liberal, agreeing on a course of action to deal with the impact on Australia of a global economic recession, which Australians are not responsible for. That is one model of national leadership. The other model of non-leadership is what we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party, who have, instead, decided to stand to one side and simply consign all Australians to have to deal with the impact of this global economic recession on their lives, their jobs, their businesses without any protection from government. That is what those opposite have decided to do.Why have they decided to do that? Because the political interests of the Leader of the Liberal Party have been put first and the national interest has been put last. The political interests of the Leader of the Liberal Party are along these lines. He really does hope that the global economic recession - a recession which he has already hauled up the white flag on - worsens so that in a year's time he can turn around and say, 'Well, you couldn't fix that.' That is what this political opportunism is all about. It is not national leadership; it is simply an exercise in political tactics. If it were just electoral political tactics that would be one thing, but what is worse about it is that it is also internal party politics, directed at the impending challenge from the member for Higgins for the leadership of the Liberal Party. Not wishing to expose himself to an attack from the right of his party, what does the Leader of the Liberal Party do? - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The member for Sturt will indeed be challenged by the events which come his way in a few months time and as to where his loyalties, to the extent that they exist, will lie. Real leadership consists of putting aside differences, in the national interest. A failure of leadership consists of putting your own personal political interests first, your own personal political survival first and that is what we have seen worked out in the 24 hours that has unfolded since the events of yesterday morning.What the governments of Australia have done today is agree on an implementation strategy for this nation-building plan for the future. What the governments of Australia have done is sit down around a table and work out a timetable for delivering stimulus to 7,500 primary schools across Australia. They have worked out a timetable for implementing a program to deliver additional funding for science wings and language laboratories in 500 secondary schools across the country. What the governments of Australia have done is sat down and worked out a timetable for implementing $6 billion worth of new outlay for 20,000 new units of social housing across the country. What the governments of Australia have done today is sit down and agree on a timetable to roll out what we will now do about black spots and about the recovery and repair of regional roads, together with additional infrastructure to be delivered to local governments across the country. That is what the governments of Australia have been doing today - sitting down, working out the best way we can advance this core challenge, dealing with the immediate impact of how we go about generating jobs in the near term and how, through that, we support the construction of infrastructure which the nation needs for the long term. That is what governments have been doing.The other thing governments have been doing today is agreeing not just on the timetable but on the machinery for doing it as well. I have confirmed the appointment of a coordinator-general for the Commonwealth, Mr Mike Mrdak from the Prime Minister's department, a public servant who has served both sides of politics well previously in the transport portfolio. Also, there will be coordinators in each of the principal program areas which the Commonwealth is funding through this unprecedented nation-building plan. State premiers and chief ministers have agreed to appoint their own coordinators-general of works, together with separate coordinators where necessary for each of the program areas. This is the practical business of government. Furthermore, what premiers and chief ministers have agreed to work on now is: how do we best bring together the various labour market programs, training programs, education programs and other programs, including those associated with regional development, to support those who will lose their jobs as a consequence of this global economic recession? That is what leadership is about - leadership we have seen from the Liberal Premier of Western Australia; leadership we have seen from the other premiers and chief ministers; leadership which has been conspicuous in its total absence in the politically self-serving strategy embarked upon by the member for Wentworth seeking purely to save his own political hide.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Liberal Party asks a question about confusion. When it comes to confusion, what is the current posture of those opposite about either the amount of stimulus they recommend, the type of tax cuts they recommend, the duration they might be for or the latest exercise in this, which is the recommendation in relation to the small business sector and the deferral of compulsory contributions to superannuation - depending on whether that is for two years as in your statement or unlimited as in his statement? This is an opposition in complete policy disarray. If you speak about confusion, speak to those opposite, led by the person who has just asked the question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. The government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan is about supporting jobs now and delivering lasting investments needed to strengthen the economy, to support jobs and to support business. Of course, the measures introduced in the House yesterday are critical and they are urgent. It is the strong preference of the tax commissioner and the chief executive of Centrelink that they pass this week. - It is not a bureaucratic timetable; it is a timetable for the Australian people to support jobs. Those opposite just do not get it. They do not understand that, because of the global recession, there is an immediate need to boost demand right now. They simply do not understand that, and without these measures more Australians will be out of work. For the first time in the history of this nation, we have had a Leader of the Opposition come into this House and intentionally vote for higher unemployment. That is what they did in this House last night. This is not a time for half measures. This is a time for governments to get cracking, to roll up their sleeves and to do what needs to be done.What is the position of those opposite? This morning on radio the shadow Treasurer had this to say about the plan from the opposition. She was on with Fran Kelly this morning and, in answer to a question about what she would do, she said that what Australia should do is 'sit and wait and see' how the global recession pans out. Talk about putting the white flag up! Sit and wait while the developed world moves into recession? Sit and wait while growth halves in China? Sit and wait while Japan, the United States and most of continental Europe go into recession? That is the white flag of surrender, and it just shows that those opposite do not have a clue about what they are doing - or maybe they do, and that is even more damning of their actions last night.I want to quote the chief economist of the IMF, who had this to say only on 29 January:Above all, adopt clear policies and act decisively.He went on to say:Delays _ in financial packages have cost _ a lot already.He went on, and everyone on that side of the House should listen, to say this:Further rounds of debate _ will stoke uncertainty and make things worse.That is what the chief economist of the IMF said only a couple of weeks ago, but the opposition do not take that advice seriously. They do not take the advice of the Business Council of Australia. They do not take the advice of most reputable economists. They do not take the advice of anybody who clearly understands the magnitude of the challenge facing this country, because what they are on about is pure politics.Of course, when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition, it is his ego that has come to the fore here. He is playing politics with the national interest because it is in his self-interest. That is exactly what he is doing, as the Prime Minister said before. He thinks he can score a cheap political point out of this and he is going for broke, and it is at the expense of the national interest. He has put his ego before our country. That is exactly what he has done. He has let the cat out of the bag again. This morning, on ABC radio, the Leader of the Opposition admitted that we do need to borrow to fund a collapse in revenues. Did you say that? Did you? - If you admit that it is the responsible thing to borrow to make up for a collapse in revenues, why are you opposing the measures here? It is just too much - is that the objection? -  - So you now say it is perfectly legitimate to borrow to make up for the collapse in revenues. Let everybody note that is what the Leader of the Opposition has said: it is legitimate to do that. It takes us to the most important point that has been fudged by the opposition right through this debate, because in excess of two-thirds of future deficits are caused by a collapse in revenue. That is the whole point. What we are doing is the responsible thing - putting in place a stimulus package to make sure we can strengthen growth. That is the responsible thing to do in these circumstances. So I wonder why he is opposing what we are doing. When he thinks it is a responsible thing to do to borrow, when he thinks it is okay to have a stimulus package - just not one as large - why wouldn't he come to the same conclusion that the Business Council of Australia, most other business representatives, most economists right around the country and the IMF have come to? I will tell you why: because he puts his ego and political interests before our country.</DOC>

 - The really disappointing thing about this debate is that it is like watching high school debaters struggling. There is a real economic crisis out there. It is about how we actually seek to prop up demand in this economy now, at a time when it is collapsing globally - net export incomes are going through the floor, private sector investments are contracting and small businesses are contracting - and the real debate is about how you bring forward activity now, and you are having some esoteric debate about a transcript here and a transcript there about legislated tax cuts. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is time we saw real leadership from someone on that side of the House. We have seen some this morning from the Liberal Premier of Western Australia. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, as he laughs nervously as the member for Higgins plans his dispatch, that he should focus on the national interest - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I note that her electorate has 64 schools - 51 primary schools, six combined schools and seven secondary schools. I note that she is someone who supports the schools in her electorate. She supports the schools in her electorate by supporting the government's $14.7 billion plan, an historic investment in schools right around the country.This plan has been supported today by the leaders of each state and territory in this nation, including the Liberal leader of Western Australia. Despite the Liberal Party being opposed to this plan and opposed to any assistance for our schools, the Liberal leader of Western Australia has said today that he endorses this plan and that he will be working with the Rudd Labor government to deliver it. And no wonder, because endorsements for this plan are flooding in from around the nation. I refer to one endorsement from a school principal at Milton North primary school - a school principal in the federal electorate of Barker. He has written in to say that he was so ecstatic when he heard the news, he burst into tears. He said:We are ecstatic about this opportunity not only for the students and staff but also for the wider community.He goes on to say:There are many flow-on effects for the community from a project like this. There will be work for our tradespeople, creating an atmosphere of optimism about the future. A facility like this in a country town will also offer opportunities for other organisations in the town. - The school is Milton North primary school. The school motto is 'Be the best you can', and a facility like this will help them to be the best they can. The member for Barker of course runs out to check on the schools in his electorate that he does not support. But in this simple statement, the truth of this program is unveiled: it is an investment in the future of Australia's children and their education, but it is also an investment today in the jobs of their parents. The Leader of the Opposition is very fond of saying -  -  - If I have mispronounced the name of the school, if I should have said it differently, then I apologise to the member for Barker. I am happy to make the email available to him or to have it supplied during question time, and then he can ring the principal and explain why he does not support the program. In this simple email, the principal is making the point that the Leader of the Opposition fails to understand -  - As I have said, I am happy to supply the email to the member. I presume he concedes that there are schools in his electorate, and I presume he concedes that he has voted against assistance for those schools, and I presume he concedes that this is a program -  -  - I am a bit bemused that people in this parliament who voted against a historic opportunity to invest in Australian schools and voted against jobs for Australians involved in those construction projects would be carrying on the way that they are. -  - Could I make this point to members of the Liberal Party who are catcalling in their contempt for Australian students and the jobs of their parents: the Leader of the Opposition is wont to wander around saying, 'We should be looking into the eyes of children and talking to them about the future.' I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, firstly, international studies show that world-class facilities make a difference to the quality of education. In that regard, I refer him to the study of the UK Department for Education and Skills, Building better performance, a report which indicates that school outcomes and the quality of school facilities are related. So if we want Australian kids to get a world-class education today so they can have a fair chance of getting the high-skills, high-wage jobs of tomorrow, then we need to be investing in our education system. And that is precisely what this program does.I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that, when he is talking about looking into the eyes of those children, there is nothing more important to the future of those children than their parents having a job. This program is about supporting and sustaining employment in this country with a historic $14.7 billion program. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, given that he has voted against this investment in schools and given that he has voted against the jobs that it would support, what his solution is. We know the Leader of the Opposition has no solution, but I was interested to see today that the member for Higgins - who is obviously taking every appearance he gets offered this week - made an appearance on ABC Radio and verified that the Liberal Party stands behind Work Choices. Now we do know what their solution is -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. This historic investment is about responding to the global financial crisis, investing in world-class education and supporting jobs. Of course, the only Liberal Party solution is the member for Higgins' solution: Work Choices - make it easier to sack people and cut their pay. That is what the Liberal Party stands for. The member for Higgins has made it perfectly clear.</DOC>

 - I have said on multiple occasions in this House that the government's legislated tax cuts proceed. There is nothing remarkable about that. The debated question here is about tax cuts versus stimulus now. I draw the honourable Leader of the Opposition's attention to comments from the chief economist of the IMF who said that tax cuts are not the most effective stimulus. He says - and he is the economist - that taxes 'tend to have less effect in the short run than measures which increase spending'. The Business Council of Australia says:A significant body of research highlights that additional tax cuts, unless very _ targeted, tend not to be the most effective measures for stimulating demand in circumstances of rising unemployment and poor confidence.Greig Gailey of the BCA says:Well our concern with tax cuts other than the offset taxes for low income earners which we absolutely support, our concern on tax cuts is that the tax cut will actually be saved when in fact we want to stimulate the economy.Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group says:The higher level income tax cuts are more likely to be saved. We are in no hurry to see those brought forward.The body of advice internationally and nationally from the credible business organisations is that, if our task is to provide stimulus here for the economy, it is to take measures such as the government is currently supporting: investing directly in infrastructure - and, together with the premiers and chief ministers, we agreed this morning on the type of infrastructure and an implementation plan - and providing support for households, about which there has been some debate in the House in the last 24 to 48 hours.As to the decision of those opposite, I seem to recall the Manager of Opposition Business said that it was unanimous within their party room - though Fran Bailey seemed to have a different view on radio this morning and various press reports seemed to indicate that various members may have had a different view. But let us just say that they resolved that this was the right course of action for them politically. What they need to answer in their own minds and in their own communities is this: what will you say to each one of those farmers who will not receive a one-off hardship payment? What will you say to each one of those families who will not be assisted with their back-to-school bonuses? What will you say to each of those families who are doing it tough and may, in fact, be suffering from the prospect of unemployment, when you, by your action, are seeking to prevent them from access to those one-off tax bonuses? What will you say to each school across the country when they come forward with each of their proposals for an assembly hall, for a new resource centre, for a new library, for a language laboratory or for a science laboratory, when each one of you is saying, 'No, no, no; we can't do that'?If the policy reasons advanced added up to something, maybe we could have a discussion. But if you look at every piece of serious advice from every credible economist, from every credible business organisation, from the international monetary and financial authorities themselves, there is no policy argument. There is no argument in terms of helping people who are doing it tough and schools that need the help. Do you know what this is all about? This is one man's personal political interest and his struggle against the member for Higgins.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for the question. As a member representing a key regional seat, he understands the importance of tourism to areas such as the Whitsundays, Mackay and Bowen, which featured so prominently in the film Australia. He also understands that the tourism industry is doing it tough at the moment as a result of the global financial crisis. It is interesting to note that the World Tourism Organisation has predicted that global tourism this year will decline for the first time since the Second World War. That is important because both international and domestic tourism are important to Australia. The government is about doing everything we can to try and assist the tourism industry in Australia to get through these tough times. That means we have to continue to invest in overseas markets so as to maintain a market presence. The industry understands that if we walk away it is going to be tougher to get back into the international tourism sector. It is also important that we understand that 75 per cent of the tourism industry in Australia is of a domestic nature. It is about time people on the other side understood that tourism is about competing for the discretionary dollar.I was pleased to note in the Herald Sun today an article including the member for McEwen speaking out against the opposition's determination to bomb this package in their party room yesterday. While she might have described their opposition as political suicide, I hope that in her contribution to the party debate yesterday she was actually thinking about the national interest. The debate about the Nation Building and Jobs Plan is a debate about what is in Australia's national interest. When you think about Australia's national interest, you should actually think about those small business operators and the 480,000 Australians directly employed in the tourism industry in Australia. You should also remember that a lot of those people are actually employed in small businesses in rural and regional Australia. Unlike the opposition, they understand that the Nation Building and Jobs Plan builds on the 2008 Economic Security Package of the Australian government, which was about putting more dollars into the pockets of Australian consumers to maintain employment. Small business operators are concerned about cash flow, and putting dollars in the hands of consumers is about putting cash through those operators' tills, which may assist them to take up the government's initiative particularly aimed at small business and claim the additional 30 per cent deduction for eligible assets to assist them in this tough economic environment.For those reasons, I think it is about time the opposition joined with the tourism industry and gave the government the support it deserves for trying to do the right thing in Australia's national interest. In that context, I refer to solid support given to the Australian government in its endeavours. I refer, for example, to a statement by Matt Hingerty, a key tourism representative known well to the member for North Sydney. Mr Hingerty said on Tuesday in response to the government's package: 'The timing of the cash bonuses was well positioned just ahead of the school holidays and Easter break.' He said that because he understands that there are 121 million days of accumulated annual leave in Australia. He understands that these payments link up with the Australian government's endeavours with key employer organisations such as ACCI to encourage Australian workers to have a holiday. - It is about time the member for Moncrieff stopped talking down the Australian tourism industry and stopped talking about a crisis. It is also about time members on the other side of the House joined with members such as the member for Dawson, the member for Lyons, the member for Leichhardt, members on the Central Coast and members in Wollongong and Newcastle - key tourism areas - and supported this package. Perhaps the members for Wide Bay, Herbert, Kalgoorlie, Flinders and Forrest, for example, should start thinking about key tourism areas such as Noosa, Townsville, Broome, Mornington Peninsula and Margaret River and join with the member for McEwen, because she understands the importance of tourism to the Yarra Valley. If when they return to their electorates this weekend they go and put their feet under the table of a local restaurant or cafe, they should think about what Peter Doyle, the President of the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association, and John Hart, its CEO, said in a media release on Tuesday of this week:The stimulus package also contained a number of cash payments that will see their way into the hands of restaurant consumers.They went on to say:_ consumers now spend nearly 10% of their household income on meals out (on average) and these additional payments, which will come just prior to the next school holidays, will be spent in restaurants and cafes.But perhaps more importantly - because this debate is about the national interest and keeping Australians in employment - they concluded with this remark:The hospitality industry is a very labour intensive industry. Spending in restaurants is a very efficient way to create or maintain employment.I leave the opposition with that thought. Back a winner - back the national interest, not the opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. We are increasing the borrowing limit because we have to fund the accumulated deficits over time and, if she knew anything about this process, she would know that it is not all done at once. So we are seeking to put in place an ample amount of money to cover those accumulated deficits - deficits which flow principally from the collapse in revenues imposed on this country by the rest of the world because of the global recession. There is nothing unusual about this; it is normal practice. -  - There is nothing unusual about borrowing on financial markets and the issuance of Commonwealth government securities. Even the member for Higgins engaged in that practice. The catcalls across the chamber just demonstrate what is motivating the opposition. It is not good policy, it is naked political advantage which stands in the road of the government doing the right thing by Australia to put in place vital measures which will stimulate demand - as the Minister for Tourism was just saying - and to provide for vital investments that will support jobs and growth over time.Of course, you can contrast that with the approach of the opposition. I was referring earlier to the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when she said this morning on Radio National's Breakfast program that we should wait to see how this global recession pans out and how it affects Australia. That is what she said. In the face of all this evidence, she thinks that we should just sit around on our hands and do absolutely nothing. That is the doctrine of calculated neglect. That is what it is, and it is dangerous. It is a dangerous approach that we are having from this opposition, because it adds to uncertainty. As the chief economist of the IMF said in those remarks that I quoted earlier, that is a dangerous thing to do in these circumstances. In these circumstances it is a time to be bold. In these circumstances it is not a time for half measures. In these circumstances it is a time to back the national interest and do the right thing by the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. At the COAG meeting chaired by the Prime Minister this morning, all state premiers and chief ministers agreed to sign up to the new nation-building program by 1 March - and I thank the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who is here today, for being a part of that. They therefore will be eligible for funding under the government's $150 million increase in road maintenance, available and intended to be spent this financial year for economic stimulus and to make our roads safer.This program, the nation-building program from 2009-13, is the biggest road and rail investment program in the history of the Commonwealth. The investment is $27 billion, with the Commonwealth contributing $22.3 billion. It means that we can get on with the job of working together - the Commonwealth and the states and territories - to build our road and our rail network and to provide jobs and economic stimulus around the nation. And we are getting on with the job. I announced, through a media release earlier today, that construction work has now commenced on the 36 kilometre southern ydney freight line. That is a $309 million project. I have been asked about how many jobs. There are 500 direct jobs and 1,000 indirect jobs. This is a 36 kilometre dedicated freight line that will unclog the single largest bottleneck on New South Wales's interstate rail network.Last December, as part of our nation-building package, we announced an additional $1.2 billion through the ARTC for 17 rail projects to be rolled out across the country to enhance freight movement and to create local jobs. This will see freight times along the Melbourne to Brisbane corridor reduced from 37 hours to 26 hours - a 30 per cent improvement. Our largest investment is in the Hunter - $1 billion. - This will directly employ - since you ask for the figures - 650 people in the Hunter. That is 650 people, and it is supported by the member for Hunter, supported by the member for Charlton, supported by the member for Newcastle and supported by the member for Shortland. The member for Paterson, however, votes against jobs in his local community.We are investing $125 million to replace old wood rail sleepers with new concrete rail sleepers in order to increase efficiency on the network, creating local jobs in factories and employing extra people right now as a result of our commitment in December. Those people are being employed in Geelong, in Wagga Wagga, in Grafton, in Mittagong - these are jobs for regional Australia. And we are not only doing it through road and rail; we are doing it through community infrastructure.As COAG was meeting, there was also today the inaugural meeting of the steering committee of the Australian Council of Local Government. Regardless of political colour, background and ideology, it came together with an absolute consensus: that we need to get on with the job of nation building and providing jobs in local communities. Every single one of those mayors has welcomed our $800 million community infrastructure package - the package that those opposite voted against - with those local programs being delivered around the nation. They also agreed that local government will play its part in assisting the COAG agenda that was being debated at the same time, making sure that the development applications for local schools get fast tracked and that we get those jobs on the ground in those local communities. But much of that funding, of course, is in jeopardy due to the reckless attitude of those opposite - the reckless, opportunistic attitude of those opposite, who, at the same time as they were voting against it, were lobbying me around the corridors of the house yesterday, asking for programs in their electorates to be funded. That is the hypocrisy that we see from those opposite. We will see whether they support these programs put forward by local government in those communities.Of course, they are confused. Their strategy is dazed and confused. Yesterday, the Manager of Opposition Business said this on 2UE: 'We're not blocking it; we're voting against it.' It got better. Today, on Sunrise, he said: 'If it's too good to be true when people receive all these handouts, it is not true. It is not real.' Well, when the Senate passes a program of $950, they will know that it is real. I do not think the Manager of Opposition Business can ever make an interjection like that again. But it gets better, because, on radio 2UE on 5 February, he said this: 'When somebody holds a gun to my head, you know, maybe it's a bit silly, but I say, 'Well, mate, pull the trigger.'' I say this to the member for North Sydney: your leader has done it. Your leader has done it to everyone along the front bench and along the back bench by opposing community infrastructure, by opposing nation building, by opposing jobs in local communities. That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition has done, because he is not interested in nation building; he is just interested in himself.</DOC>

 - The honourable member, I think, asked a question in three parts. One was the impact on jobs of last year's ESS. -  - No, I am coming to it; I am just getting it right. The second was the current package and the -  -  - No, I have got that. And the third one was the interest rates. First of all, the government's Economic Security Strategy was announced last October. It was delivered in December. As the honourable member would know, the full employment impact of that would not be known for some time. But, as the honourable member struggled yesterday with the most recently produced retail figures for the nation, to their collective dismay and disappointment, this country outperformed practically every other country in the world in terms of retail sales at that time. Obviously there will be some form of spillover of that investment into the support packages for households into the year 2010 as well.Secondly, as the honourable member knows, the package that the government announced two days ago of some $42 billion represents, as we have said, a total employment impact in terms of supporting jobs of up to 90,000. On the breakdown of the individual components of that: I will of course provide those to the Leader of the Opposition later. I do not have them with me, but I will be happy to do so.Thirdly, he asked a question about debt. On the question of the impact of the borrowings which would flow, I am advised that the interest payments would equal something in the vicinity of an additional 0.2 per cent of GDP at the time that they begin to be paid. If there is any variation on that, I will come back to the honourable member before the end of question time.Could I also say to the honourable member who has asked the question that, as they seek, as is their democratic right - and they are members of this parliament -  -  - I know those opposite do not wish to actually debate that which is real here, which is: how do you deal with providing the stimulus which the Australian economy needs because of the global economic crisis? We have a program put forward. It is costed. The assumptions have been backed by the Treasury, and we stand by those because they represent for us a credible strategy to see Australia through this crisis.The alternative is not just sitting on the fence, not just carping from the sidelines, but an avalanche of politically opportunistic negativity from those opposite. But here is the ultimate irony for those opposite. There they are, representing the forces of neoliberalism around the world. There they are representing the forces of unrestrained greed. There they are, representing the forces of unrestrained markets, representing the forces also represented by unprincipled merchant bankers operating with under-regulated markets - their entire ideology, which has brought this crisis about - and yet they are unprepared to lift a political finger to support this government's efforts to deal with the consequences of that crisis. This is the ultimate irony, the ultimate hypocrisy of those opposite: the unrestrained greed, unprincipled merchant bankers, under-regulated financial markets - at the absolute core of neoliberalism - causing this crisis worldwide, and there they stand back, smugly, seeking to take political advantage of this government's attempts to deal with the consequences of that crisis for working people. Those opposite have contested whether in fact they are really neoliberals. Remember, as the Leader of the Liberal Party has said in response to this debate on unregulated financial markets: 'Let us simply let the market run its course.' - The Leader of the Opposition has said on multiple occasions, 'Let the market run its course.' That is the very heart of the neoliberal agenda which has brought about this mayhem on markets worldwide, with impacts on working people, who now pay the price through the loss of jobs right across the world and in our country as well. The Leader of the Opposition reinforced that in the debate in the parliament on Tuesday when he began citing as his new authority on fiscal policy Professor Taylor from Stanford University in the United States, who is himself one of the archdeacons of neoliberalism. Remember what Professor Taylor said? He always asks himself each morning: 'What would Milton do next?' - that is, what would Milton Friedman do next? And then you have not just these statements of ideology but also the action itself of ideology, which is to block this government's efforts in the Senate to actually deal with the stimulus needs necessary to repair growth, growth which has been undermined by neoliberal wanton behaviour around the world which has brought this crisis about in the first place.So there you have this extraordinary contradiction - their ideology wreaking havoc on the world economy and them refusing to support any course of action to deal with the consequences of their ideology's spectacular failure. How about, I say to the Leader of the Opposition, you just stand up one day and say, 'Maybe this neoliberalism, maybe this market fundamentalism - maybe we just got it wrong.' How about a word of apology about all of those investment bankers around the world who creamed it, who scored tens and hundreds of millions of dollars out of this? How about just a word of apology which said you might have got it wrong? And how about a word of action to support a government's efforts to clean up the wreckage after you? That is the moral challenge here, a moral challenge which has been failed by the Liberal Party corporately and by the Leader of the Opposition personally.</DOC>

 - The government is dealing with an unprecedented economic crisis consequent upon the global economic challenge, and naturally the government has sought advice. The government has sought advice from Treasury, from the IMF and from the financial regulators, and it is paying close attention to the opinions of market economists, to industry organisations and to governments of other major developed nations. Naturally in an economic crisis, Mr Speaker, you would expect that a government would pay attention to the advice, to the opinions, of people who know something about economics. Amazingly enough, this is not a universally held view - that in an economic crisis you might ask people like economists what they think about how to deal with it. In fact, the opposition believes that that is the last thing you should do - actually talk to economists. Twice yesterday the member for North Sydney said that the last people you would talk to about dealing with an economic crisis would be economists. He said on 2BL:Economists will always go to extremes. Economists will say in downturns, 'Spend, spend, spend.'And then in the MPI he backed it up with:They should not be listened to in those good times, just as surely as they should not always be the bible during bad times.This is the guy who has just become the frontrunner for the member for Curtin's job as shadow Treasurer. His view of economic advice is that, in order to be the Minister for Finance - and Deregulation - or indeed the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, the last thing you do is actually talk to economists, the last thing you do is seek advice from people who have got some expertise in that area. You wonder who in fact he would consult - maybe some faith-healers would be the idea, or numerologists or astrologers. I see him there in his office late at night with the lights off, with a ouija board out there, going: 'Milton, Milton, are you there, Milton? Tell us what to do, Milton.' 
Government members - He said Milton, not Wilson! - I was mentioning Milton Friedman to make the point that in fact what the member for North Sydney said yesterday was not literally accurate, not precisely correct, because there are indeed a few select economists that he and the opposition do listen to - a few people like Arthur Laffer, John Taylor and Milton Friedman. And they just happen to be the people who believe that tax cuts for wealthy people and knocking over the rights of working people in the workplace are the solution to every economic problem. It does not matter what the issue, it does not matter what the debate, the answer is always: tax cuts for the rich and knocking over the rights of working people in the workplace.It is not surprising, therefore, to hear the views of the member for North Sydney on Sunrise this morning, where he stated:Broadly based tax cuts will provide long-term incentives for people to continue to work.I wonder which people that would be. For the ordinary working people I know, their incentives to continue to work are to eat, to pay the rent and the mortgage. They do not need big tax cuts for the wealthy in order to have an incentive to work; they have to work.It is hardly surprising that the Leader of the Opposition and his troops cannot make up their minds about whether Australia is going to have a recession or not. The Leader of the Opposition says that a recession is avoidable, that it may not happen. And yet we have had within the space of a couple of days the member for Sturt, the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the member for Warringah all saying that it is a red-hot certainty that Australia is going into recession. It may well be just a coincidence, but I think all three of them are Costello supporters; I think they may all be supporters of the member for Higgins. The government in turn is interested in expert advice -  - I will indeed, Mr Speaker. The government is acting in accordance with advice from Treasury, from the International Monetary Fund and the vast bulk of opinion both in Australia and around the world from expert economists, from industry organisations and all people with expertise in these areas. We are interested in taking action to protect and to sustain jobs and economic growth in this country, not to fight the obscure ideological and class-based battle for the rich which is the preserve of the opposition. We are facing in this country a global economic crisis that has largely been caused by investment bankers. The investment banker running the Liberal Party is so arrogant that he thinks he can run Australia from opposition in the middle of that crisis.</DOC>

 - When I stood here a year ago the first time I answered a question and mentioned that I came to this portfolio with very little background knowledge, it never occurred to me at the time that the leadership of the National Party came to this parliament with even less. As we conclude this week in parliament, the member for Ballarat will be able to go back to Ballarat and, when asked by any of the more than 200 farmers who will be in receipt of the farmers' hardship payment what she has done, she will be able to tell them that she has defended it for them. In the same way, she will be able to explain to them that hardship and drought have an impact not just directly on farmers but on entire towns and that projects such as the upgrade of schools have an extraordinary impact not just on the students and teachers themselves but on employment opportunities for construction workers, the transport industry and subcontractors. All of that feeds into local retail as well.The leadership of the National and Liberal parties have put the people who sit behind them in this chamber in the most extraordinary position this weekend. While members like the member for Ballarat will be able to go back to their electorates and answer questions very easily about how they have defended and tried to help their constituents, when the member for Barker is asked, 'Which schools are you going to support an upgrade of?', he will already have the list of every school he is trying to prevent from having an upgrade. When people opposite on the backbench go back to their electorates and are asked in good faith by their constituents whether or not they are eligible for any of the bonus payments, they are going to have to say, 'Oh, no, the leadership of the Liberal and National parties is trying to prevent you getting any of those bonus payments.' When people ask whether or not they are going to be eligible for the farmers' hardship payment, while the member for New England will be able to say to more than 350 farming families that he has defended it for them, the people sitting in the back rows on the other side of the chamber are going to have to say, 'Oh, no, we are trying to stop you from getting any of that money.'I deliberately blame the people who sit on the front row of those seats opposite because there are people who sit behind them who actually have understood for some time the importance of a package like this. I quote with great authority - and I was impressed to hear the words - back to 23 October last year the member for Gippsland because he said:Investing in regional infrastructure will help local communities to withstand the worst of the global financial crisis and I encourage the government to act quickly in this regard.I table that press release. The people who sit in the front row opposite have sitting behind them people who actually understand and are now going to be forced into the humiliating position all weekend - it might only last two days but it will be a very long weekend - of explaining why they are not supporting a plan that they know is in the national interest.</DOC>

 - The member for North Sydney, the Manager of Opposition Business, has asked me a question about the Australian Business Investment Partnership. This investment partnership was put together with the cooperation of the major banks and the support of the property sector across the country for one very good reason. It is not just the employment intensity within that sector, some 150,000 people; it goes to what happens to the value of property assets across this nation if there is a retreat from this nation of foreign bank syndication of current Australian bank loans to that sector. The consequence for the whole economy of a collapse in asset values in this sector would be catastrophic. The quantum of the refinancing due in 2009 across the Australian economy - and there are varying estimates of this - is somewhere in the range of $50 billion to $75 billion. The question arises: what is the proportion of that represented by existing bank syndication from abroad which could be withdrawn, as you see evidence around the world of that happening? The answer to that flows into the category of some tens of billions of dollars. Therefore, you have two courses of action. The Liberal Party is saying let the free market rip -  - I will return to what I was saying before, because the honourable member raises an important question: why have we embarked on this course of action and what are the consequences that flow from it and the consequences that would flow from not doing it? If you have a withdrawal of foreign bank syndication, what would happen therefore is that there would be a further factor fuelling the collapse of asset prices in this country. If that occurred - and all serious economists and economic writers are concerned about this - the flow-on effect to the general economy would be huge. That is why, based on the advice we received, this was the most prudent course of action.I say to the honourable member that when the joint vehicle, the Australian Business Investment Partnership, is activated, of course it will involve the Commonwealth in the acquisition of assets. Therefore, assets will appear on the Commonwealth government's overall ledger. That is a key point that he should bear in mind. The further point I make is this: as the Liberal Party embarks upon what is plainly its political strategy, which is about deficit and debt, those opposite think that they are onto a real political winner. Their political strategy is clear for all to see. They do not care about the consequences on the property sector in Australia, they do not care about the consequences for families who are struggling with the impact of the financial crisis -  - and they do not care about the collapse in construction, which we seek to deal with through the construction program that will come off the back of the primary schools investment program. They do not care about any of that, because they are driven by a political strategy that is all about deficit and debt. Those opposite need to reflect on this in a moment of intellectual honesty, which is getting harder and harder for them to do.Firstly, as the Treasurer indicated, there has been a $125 billion collapse in government revenues. Given that that has occurred and that it is a global phenomenon, I ask those opposite if they would borrow to fill that gap? If you say you would not borrow to fill that gap, there are two courses of action available to you: to cut government expenditure by that equivalent amount - that is, $125 billion - or to increase taxes by an equivalent amount. Which is it - you can borrow it, you can increase taxes or you can cut expenditure? Those opposite refuse to provide an honest intellectual answer. If you are going to balance your budget, every government in the world has those three options in these economic circumstances. - This is quite critical to where we are going. The first huge impact in terms of the borrowing requirements of the Commonwealth was the collapse in Commonwealth government revenues - $125 billion. We have said how that has occurred; we have detailed the tax categories. That is happening right across the world. Is Mr Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, going to say that he would not borrow for that? - I would be very keen to see an unequivocal statement in writing from the Leader of the Opposition as to whether he would do that or not. That goes to the core of the intellectual fraudulence of the substantive case that they are arguing. Secondly, what further addition is there to government borrowing? Further additions occur as a result of having an increase in social security payments, which are a consequence of people becoming unemployed. That also affects the forward estimates and therefore that becomes a second area of unanticipated expenditure. Then you come to the third area. The third area goes to the quantum of the stimulus. We have said upfront what the quantum of our stimulus is. We have said that it is $42 billion. That is what we regard as being necessary to support the economy now. -  - I hear again the avalanche of intellectual honesty coming from those opposite! How much stimulus do they support? One moment they say that it is about $15 billion, then at a different moment they say it might be $20 billion. I looked at the member for Aston's statement earlier today where he talked about $20 billion plus, because that is Treasury's estimate of the cost of the proposal that he has put forward. His proposal is for small business not to pay the superannuation guarantee levy for two years. That would therefore be met by the taxpayer. Therefore, when you put all of their costed stimulus packages together -  - The question asked by the Manager of Opposition Business goes to the question of debt. What I have sought to do in going through this in some detail is to expose the intellectual fraudulence of their argument. There are three components here: (1) will they borrow in order to meet the collapse in Commonwealth government revenue - that is, a $125 billion collapse, most recently added to by the quantum of $75 billion; (2) there are other unanticipated expenses which arise from social security payments; and (3) there is the quantum of the stimulus package. Those opposite call for a stimulus of about $20 billion, more depending on whether you listen to the member for Aston or not. We say $42 billion. What is the difference in the overall quantum? It is something in the order of $20 billion. What I would like to see is some intellectually honest accounting from those opposite about what they would support by way of borrowing or otherwise. Instead, they have embarked upon a political strategy.I conclude my remarks with those that I began question time with today - that is, this is all directed by the leader of the Liberal Party against his uncertainty about the member for Higgins. It is politics pure and simple.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Corangamite for his question. He is a very keen and hardworking local member. The government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan includes an historic investment in social housing - $6.4 billion to build 20,000 new homes for needy Australians, including pensioners, homeless Australians and low-income families. There is also money to repair 2,500 homes. We know yesterday that the HIA suggested that this package would support 35,000 jobs in the construction industry in towns, suburbs, cities and regional areas.The construction sector is one of the largest employers in this country. It accounts for about nine per cent of all jobs, which is almost one million workers. If these measures pass, work can start almost immediately, building and repairing homes right across Australia. States and territories have repair and maintenance backlogs. They can call tradespeople in to start that work straightaway. But there are also whole new projects ready to go. The land is set aside, the plans are drawn up, approvals have been given. It is all systems go. What they have been waiting on is funding. If this funding flows then we know that local builders, plumbers, tilers, electricians and carpenters can be employed. These people are facing less work otherwise and some of them are facing no work.I have asked my state colleagues to tell me the sorts of proposals that they will be putting forward in our first tranche of building. The Victorian Minister for Housing, for example, has given me a few proposals that he would like to bring forward. I know that the member for Corangamite and the member for Corio will be very interested to know that it is proposed to build 89 homes in their area of Geelong. I know that the member for Ballarat will be very happy to know that 45 homes are to be built in Ballarat and Horsham. It would be very good to see the member for Mallee supporting this initiative to support those jobs in his local area.The members for Indi and Murray might be interested to know that tradies in their electorates could be employed to build 51 new homes in their areas. That includes a 10-unit development for aged pensioners in Wodonga. Would you like to see that built? Would you like 10 units for aged pensioners in Wodonga? Each of these projects will support vital jobs in regional areas, keep tradespeople employed, keep apprentices busy and keep money in local communities.The government has a plan to support jobs to build our nation for the future. It is a shame to see the Leader of the Opposition playing a political game when jobs are at stake, when small businesses and contractors are already doing it very tough. I am very sorry to see members opposite voting against construction jobs in their electorates, voting against work that will keep builders busy through these tough times - 2009 will be a very tough year for the construction sector, anyway. And what the opposition wants to do is make that year even tougher.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. It is the case that Australian state governments do borrow on financial markets and, most particularly and most importantly, they borrow to finance critical economic infrastructure. They have been doing that for some time because it builds the nation, it creates jobs and it expands our productive capacity. So the states are borrowing. I could not give you the figure that they have out there at the moment, or what the total amount of state government borrowings is, but they do that and they do it with the approval of the Australian Loan Council. If the member wants to know what the total amount of state government borrowings stands at today, I could not give her that final figure, but I would be more than happy to supply it to her after question time. I am quite happy to supply that. But I would make a more general point about debt, and this is very important because -  - What is? - The state governments borrow different amounts at different periods of time. That is what they do. -  - I would like to make this point, because those opposite have now admitted that they would borrow to make up for the gap in government revenues which has been caused by the global financial crisis. We are going to borrow to do that. Governments in the past have borrowed to do that. The federal government has a AAA credit rating. We have a very sound balance sheet, and net debt in this country is very low by international standards. It is very low, and that is a good thing, and it is one of the things that gives us the capacity to respond to the global financial crisis. Net debt, as the shadow Treasurer would see in the papers that we have published this week, is expected to be about five per cent of GDP at the end of the forward estimates. That compares to 45 per cent across the OECD. So we have a strong balance sheet, a strong capacity to borrow to support jobs and economic growth in this country, and that is the responsible thing to do.The states do the same, and they did the same under your government, the Howard government. They borrowed for critical economic infrastructure. It was ticked off by the Loan Council, just as it is ticked off by this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley for his question and acknowledge his advocacy and support of the 38 primary schools, nine combined primary-secondary schools, 18 secondary schools and one special school in his electorate, all of which will benefit from our Building the Education Revolution program, which is there to benefit every school in this country. This program, of course, is supported by the people who care about education, particularly the Australian Primary Principals Association, which said:The education package provides much needed support for our building industry but more importantly it is a long term investment for Australia's young children.I table that press release. Of course, it got strong support from the Australian Special Education Principals Association, who have talked about how it is 'a shot in the arm for special schools around the nation who have been struggling to provide quality learning environments for students with disabilities'. They go on to talk about the problems of teaching those students in temporary, fabricated, non-purpose-built classrooms that are up to 30 years old. I table that press release.In view of this endorsement from the education community, what we know at the end of this sitting week, as parliament draws to a close, is that members of parliament on this side of the House will be able to go back to their local communities saying that they have a Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Members on that side of the House will go back saying that they have no plan. Members on this side of the House will go back to their local communities saying that they are united in their determination to work with Australians as they face this global financial crisis. Members on that side of the House will go back deeply divided, as the cracks in their position already show, with members like the member for McEwen and the member for Menzies not endorsing the foolish strategy being pursued by the Leader of the Opposition. Importantly, members on this side of the House will be able to go back to their communities saying that they are pursuing the national interest, whereas members on that side of the House will go back trying to defend their rank political interest. Members on this side of the House will go back to their local schools able to talk to them about new investments, meaning new jobs, in their local communities. It really does amaze me what members on that side of the House are going to say to those local schools.To give you some indication of the kinds of twists and turns members on that side of the House are going to have to engage in, I have, of course, received correspondence from members on that side of the House about the circumstances of their local schools - schools they now say should not get a cent from the Building the Education Revolution program. I refer to correspondence from the member for McEwen, who said, 'Healesville High School is in desperate need of better facilities,' and I table that correspondence. What is she going to say? I am the minister with a program that you voted against that could assist Healesville High -  -  - Exactly! I have the correspondence of the member for Parkes, who wrote to me about the circumstances of Gulgong High School. He wrote:I am writing on behalf of Gulgong High School, who are in great need of further capital and maintenance works to school facilities.I table that correspondence. What is he going to say to that local school? On the same day he wrote to me again, saying that he was writing on behalf of Moree Secondary College Student Representative Council, who had great concerns over the terrible state of a number of student facilities at the college's Carol Avenue campus. I table that correspondence. What is he going to say to that local community?Then I refer to correspondence I received from the member for La Trobe, who raised with me the circumstances of Sassafras Primary School. He wrote:Minister, I have very strong concerns about the need for funding for upgrades to Sassafras Primary School.What is he going to say to that local school? I table that correspondence.On the question of the school communities of the member for Barker, which was raised in this parliament earlier today, I table for the House the list of 104 schools in the Barker electorate that are eligible to benefit from the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program of the government, a program he is opposed to. - I am coming to that. I table for the benefit of the House the list of 127 schools in his electorate that would be eligible to benefit from our national school pride program, a program he is opposed to. I table for the benefit of members in the House the list of 19 secondary schools in his electorate who would be eligible for our 21st century science and language centres program, a program he is opposed to.Finally, for the benefit of members in the House, I table an email. I am going to apologise: it has been the sort of week where the name 'Milton' has been on the brain. But, yes, this is a piece of correspondence from the headmaster of the school at Millicent; undoubtedly the Leader of the Opposition would like it renamed 'Milton'. But, because of the Rudd Labor government, this is a school eligible for our Building the Education Revolution program, and I would be interested to see what the member for Barker has to say to them when he gets home, seeing how excited they are about this program. I table this piece of correspondence. Members of the Liberal Party are opposed to building an education revolution, they are opposed to local jobs, they are acting in their rank political interest, and now they are going to have days and days back at home trying to explain that to their local community members. It is going to be an interesting sight to see.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As the Leader of the Opposition will be aware, the government's plan for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme has been outlined in a white paper. The government's plan and intention remain unchanged on that - that is, to legislate consistent with the white paper. On the question of the proposed House of Representatives inquiry to which the honourable member refers, the concern of the government was that in this chamber there were early indications that the opposition would politicise the inquiry. For those reasons, we assume that if there is to be a parliamentary inquiry into these matters it will probably occur in the Senate as a matter of course.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo. I note, in particular, the impact of the fires on the communities in his electorate - the houses lost and the other suffering that has occurred there, as it has occurred in so many parts of Victoria. In answering the honourable member's question, and with the indulgence of the House, I would like also to respond to some of the matters just raised by the member for McEwen. I thank her for the way in which she presented the concerns of her constituents here today. I think the way in which the member for McEwen has engaged in the debate on the condolence motion and the way in which she has put matters forward for the House's and the government's consideration reflects parliament working at its best. I listened very carefully to the matters raised by the member and I will come back to discuss more broadly how the government proposes from here on to deal with the challenges in each of the bushfire affected areas, because we are in this for the long haul.All of us have been stunned and saddened by what has happened in Strathewen in particular. I listened very carefully to what the honourable member said about that. In our country's history it is probably incomparable, perhaps including the First World War, in its effect on individual small rural communities, that one in four members of a town, of a community, could simply be killed. That community can never be the same. The honourable member spoke also of Marysville and the impact there. Again, I simply say to the constituents of McEwen, through the honourable member, that the searing impact that this has on rebuilding community life when such a huge part of each community is no longer there is beyond each of our imaginings - but it is no longer beyond hers.I acknowledge also the contribution yesterday during the National Day of Mourning of the Leader of the Opposition, as all of us in this place try to come to grips with our responsibilities from here. We, all of us in this place, are not just struggling with the dimensions of what happened both personally and emotionally but also struggling with the burden of history that the member for McEwen presents us with. The burden of history is this: there have been many inquiries before about many fires. I hate to think how many of those recommendations have not been acted upon by governments of whichever persuasion, of whichever level and at whichever point in history.So what do we now do to make a difference? I have listened carefully to what the honourable member for McEwen has said about certain practical matters. My undertaking to you is that on each of the matters you have raised, your new best friend, Sarah - who has been my best friend in my office for quite some time - will come back and work these matters through with you over the course of the year.I will take those matters in sequence. The question of safe shelters: we have been looking at this in recent weeks as the debate has inevitably re-emerged. In the days ahead, together with other affected members, we would like to begin a conversation with you about how this can be examined properly in terms of what scientifically might work in the future, and, if it will work, how we then do it on the ground. On the question of the basic provision of telephone services, the honourable member's contribution is very cogent - that is, you have to have a mobile telephone service to get a message out. We need to do better across the board on this. We know - and in particular honourable members on the other side of the House representing a number of rural and regional areas know full well - the huge gaps that exist in the system across the country.Debate will now unfold on vegetation management. I say to the honourable member for McEwen that my experience is perhaps a little like hers - that is, it is useful, once we have agreed on the course of action, to provide specific incentives for it to be achieved in practice on the ground. But let us wait for the resolution of the 'what', in terms of the content of any future regime on vegetation management, and then there will be the question of the 'how'. Let us deal with that, again, as a matter of practice.The honourable member for McEwen also referred to the question of immediate employment in her community. Certainly, in my discussions with many of her constituents, this is of immediate and real concern. As the honourable member herself said to me in conversations, with communities devastated and there being, for various reasons, a delay in the return to communities, how then do businesses normally operating have enough clientele to keep their businesses going? An example I ran into in Kinglake the weekend before last, from memory, was the baker, who said to me that he normally employs 12 people - I do not think anyone here will hold me to account if I do not have the number exactly right - but, given what has happened to the community, what will he do when currently his sale of bread can support a staff of perhaps four to six? Those are people for whom he has a deep sense of commitment. You are right; I am about to throw this matter into the in-tray of the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, because it is not just this example; it is a very practical example of similar small businesses spread right across that community and other communities.The honourable member for Bendigo also spoke about the reconstruction authority. The honourable member and I have had discussions about this and about the need to have confidence in that authority over time. I will certainly be attentive to the honourable member's views as we work our way through this in implementing the work of the reconstruction authority.I say to the honourable member for McEwen that, on the matters she has raised, and on the matters which her constituents may not yet have raised with her but will do so in the course of the year, the offer that I have extended to her and to other honourable members remains valid. When the honourable member runs into the inevitable obstacles which will occur along the road, that resource remains available to her, and I say that formally in this place.More broadly across the state of Victoria, to other affected communities - and this goes to the core of the question asked by the honourable member for Bendigo - as the Leader of the Opposition and I said yesterday in Melbourne, the resolve of this place is to rebuild each of these communities until it is done. As I said yesterday, that is easy to say and hard to do, because we know what will happen in three, six, nine or 12 months time when there is some local bunfight over something or other, as we have to wrestle between the conflicting interests of one local authority and a state government over what should happen on one block of land or another. We are all experienced in this place; we know what it is like. I believe that my commitment and that of the Leader of the Opposition are the same. As each of these things is raised, and through the agency of the reconstruction authority and the community reference committee which will advise it, let us together continue to work through each of these challenges. We do not even know the full list yet, and it will not be known for some time. But I believe it is absolutely important for all of us here to make clear to the people in each of those communities our resolve that we as members of this parliament - Labor, Liberal, National and Independent - will stay with these communities until the completion of the task in each of them.Finally, I said previously when this tragedy unfolded - and I will repeat it here for the House again today - that the Commonwealth's contribution to this reconstruction effort will be uncapped. I say that again for the benefit of all members. Therefore, as we embark upon this challenge in each community, let there be no doubt that this government, through this parliament, will honour that commitment in terms of the supply of funding necessary to restore these communities to where they were.To the honourable member for Bendigo, and to the people who have suffered in his area, could I simply say this. My understanding from discussions over the weekend is that many houses, some 50 or 60 houses, have been destroyed in his city of Bendigo - and he may correct me on this. Can I say that the destruction of a person's house in Bendigo is as important to this government as what happens in Indi, McMillan, McEwen, Mallee or anywhere else. I think there is enough goodwill in this place - let us all be honest with each other in holding each other to account on this and see this one through. I thank the House.</DOC>

 - As all honourable members in the House will be aware, we are now confronting a global economic recession, and that has consequences for the Australian economy, has consequences for Australian workers and has consequences for Australian jobs. The practical challenge, therefore, before all governments is what to do about it in both the short and the long term, and that brings us to the debate about the appropriate form of stimulus to be used in the short term. The government's policy on this is absolutely clear-cut and articulated in the nation-building plan that was legislated by this parliament in recent times. The part of that nation-building plan which deals with one-off tax bonuses and other consumption measures, as the honourable member will be aware, is specifically designed to provide stimulus to the economy in the near term in order to provide extra support for growth and jobs until such time as the global economy recovers and, in particular, until global private financial markets recover and private credit flows recommence.The other part of the government's strategy is this: apart from adding to consumption in the economy by those measures in the short term, and to get the effect of that out into the economy as quickly as possible, we have accompanied that with investment in schools and in public housing as well as other investments in energy efficient housing. The purpose of this $42 billion nation-building plan, in both of its arms, is to be temporary and targeted in order to support growth in calendar year 2009 and into 2010. It stands, therefore, in complete contrast with entrenching longer term tax cuts, which of course make the task of returning the government to budget balance and budget surplus in the future more difficult. Those are the reasons the government has embarked upon the strategy it has implemented and now legislated through the parliament. It is a strategy which the government stands fully behind.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question and, through her, I thank the people of Ballarat for their enormous contribution. Many of the areas around the electorate of the member for Ballarat have been threatened by fire, and if she could thank those people on behalf of the House we would appreciate that. It is the case that, even though we are now two weeks from the 7 February fires, Victoria remains on bushfire alert. While the rest of the nation was mourning yesterday, many firefighters were out doing their very important tasks, and, once again, today they are battling extreme weather conditions.Even though the fire threat continues, what is positive is that the rebuilding has begun. As the member for McEwen has so eloquently said to us all here today, that is exactly what people want to do. Even though it is a massive task they have in front of them, let me just say to the member for McEwen, the member for McMillan, the member for Bendigo - all those who have been so devastated by these fires - that so many of the people I have met over the last couple of weeks have said to me clearly that they want to rebuild their own homes and they want to rebuild their communities.If I can inform and update the House: the Australian government and the Victorian government today have made a very significant step forward to assist individuals and families, businesses and communities to do that. One very important step that we have announced today is that, together, the Australian government and the Victorian government will fund and deliver a site clean-up and demolition program that is crucial to rebuilding the lives of individuals and communities. It is also vital for public health and safety. We have all seen the horror of the wreckage: the corrugated iron, the dangerous trees and the mounds of ash and glass. We have been informed that there are many places where there are dangerous chimneys and trees, asbestos and other contamination. All of this needs to be dealt with quickly but it does have to be dealt with safely. It is also important for people to be able to deal with the emotional confrontation of what they have faced over the last two weeks, because it is only when this clean-up is done that people will be able start rebuilding the bricks and mortar of their lives.The demolition program is expected to run for approximately six months, and I think that gives us some idea of the dimension of what we face. There are key steps that need to be followed in this demolition program and the clean-up that follows. First and foremost, we still have a major coronial period of time in front of us, so people will not be able to begin the clean-up until the coroner and the police give their permission, and I think everybody understands that. Sites will then be assessed for safety and hazards will be removed. But I think what is very important to say to everybody is that everyone's constituents in the fire-affected areas need to know that time will be given to people to go onto their sites to retrieve any remaining items that may have escaped the inferno, and that will be a very important time for people. Then the sites will be cleared by licensed contractors. Can I just say to anybody who is affected that this is an entirely voluntary offer by both the federal and the state governments. If people want to organise this themselves, they can and it will be paid for by the federal and state governments together, but this is a way of enabling it to happen quickly and in a safe manner.Let me say, particularly in response to a concern raised by the member for McEwen and by many people I have spoken to, that even though this will be organised by the Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority with a project manager that they will appoint, local contractors will be employed, because we do understand just how important it is to make sure that local people have the opportunity for work. They will need to be licensed contractors because many of the materials they will be removing are dangerous. We will be advised very shortly of the person who will be appointed by Major General Cantwell to the reconstruction and recovery authority. As I said before, all costs from this clean-up and demolition will be met by the federal and state governments. That will not depend on whether or not anybody has insurance. We think this is one very important way in which we can help people begin this critical process of reconstruction and recovery.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. This is a serious issue and it deserves a very serious and considered answer because we are in the middle of a global recession which is impacting severely on this country. We have seen European growth contract by 1.5 per cent, we have seen Japan contract by 3.3 per cent in the December quarter and we have seen Taiwan, in recent days, contract by something like six per cent. We have seen the impact of this on the national budget to the tune of something like $115 billion since the last budget, we have also seen the fact that the stock market has lost something like $600 billion in value and, of course, we have seen the impact on the super accounts of Australians. What we are now seeing in Queensland, a resource rich state, is the impact of the global recession and, most particularly, the impact that flows through to this country, including our resource rich states, of the halving of growth in China. - Certainly, Mr Speaker. We have seen, for example, that coal prices have halved in the last six months. All of that has had a dramatic impact on the Queensland budget. We have seen that the Queensland government, along with other state governments, has borrowed in recent years to build critical economic infrastructure. Of course, one of the reasons they have borrowed to build critical economic infrastructure is that those opposite would not make any of those investments precisely at the time they were needed, particularly in the resource rich states. So it is the case that Australian states have borrowed in recent years to finance critical economic infrastructure.Indeed, the member for Higgins ticked off on much of this when he was in the Treasury position. He, as Chairman of the Loan Council, ticked off on much of this borrowing by state governments in recent years. Something like $13 billion worth of borrowing by state government in recent years was ticked off by the member for Higgins. Of course, the other thing that state governments had to do, particularly in areas like health, was borrow, because the federal government at that time did not come to the party and, instead, seriously cut health funding. So, yes, state governments have been borrowing responsibly to fund critical economic infrastructure, and that was signed off by the previous government through the member for Higgins as Chairman of the Loan Council at that time.This country, nationally and at a state level, has been hit by a global recession. That, of course, has had a dramatic impact on our budget revenues and on state government budget revenues, and that has led to a decision by a rating agency to downgrade the state of Queensland. It has certainly had that impact, and the cause of that is the global recession. What we see in the House today is a sharp difference between the Rudd government on this side and the Turnbull led opposition on that side, who say: 'Nothing should be done about that. You should just sit and wait and see.' On that side of the House, their attitude to this situation is very simple: governments should not act - in our case, have a temporary deficit so we can create jobs and cushion the Australian economy. In the case of the Queensland government, the opposition are saying it should not be borrowing -  - There is a very sharp contrast. On this side of the House we believe, in the face of a global recession, that governments must act, and our first choice must be to act to support employment. The Liberal and National parties in this House and in Queensland do not support jobs because they are the parties of higher unemployment. In this House, the Liberal and National parties opposed the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, of which $8 billion will go into Queensland to support jobs. Let history record: the Liberal and National parties in Canberra and in Queensland oppose our nation-building plan and the jobs that go with it.What this government will do with state governments, including the government of Western Australia, is sit down with them through the COAG processes and the Loan Council processes and talk to them about their future needs in this new environment. We will do that in a cooperative way. We will do it with the government of Western Australia and we will do it with the government of Queensland. We will do it in the interests of Australia and in the interests of creating jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know of and acknowledge the suffering of many people in his electorate, and I commend him and all representatives in this House who have really shown leadership on behalf of their electorates, including most recently today the member for McEwen.Naturally, my comments are not directed to matters before the courts - I indicate that at the outset - but clearly this inexplicable, most un-Australian and reprehensible of crimes remains a threat to the Australian community in terms of both lives lost and property destroyed. In fact, a recent report by the Australian Institute of Criminology released a matter of weeks before the Victorian disaster, entitled Using crime prevention to reduce deliberate bushfires in Australia, outlined how extensive that problem was. It established that some 13 per cent of bushfires are deliberately lit. It is suspected that up to 50 per cent - half of the fires in Australia - are deliberately lit. The report also indicated, concerningly, that an additional seven per cent are probably attributable to people discarding cigarettes from their car windows - also preventable and a matter that we are looking at. It is estimated that the cost of bushfires to the Australian community each and every year, even before the Victorian tragedy, is about $1.6 billion. I know members of both sides have been concerned about this. Penalties for arson vary from state to state but they can include life in prison. We would think that that is appropriate given the death and destruction that, quite evidently, these crimes can cause.Clearly, arson is a complex crime that requires a multifaceted and cooperative approach to addressing it. A number of good ideas were highlighted in the Australian Institute of Criminology report. These included greater cooperation between firefighting and law enforcement agencies aimed at crime prevention, reducing access to fuel at hotspots, developing effective neighbourhood watch programs in these areas and pursuing education programs to ensure that young people appreciate the tremendous devastation that their actions, if they commit this sort of conduct, can cause their own communities. All of these are worthy recommendations. Around Australia, as you would expect, a number of very successful programs have been implemented which we can draw upon.I can announce today that next month, in March, I will chair a meeting of state and territory firefighting and police agencies, including representations from the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre and other experts from each jurisdiction to bring together expertise in this matter. We will certainly seek to identify immediate measures that can be implemented to prevent arson, and in the coming months we will work at developing and sharing best practice in respect of prevention, education and law enforcement capability in response. I look forward to working with my state and territory colleagues to tackle the scourge of arson that takes such a devastating toll on our community.</DOC>

 - The shadow Treasurer has the hide of a rhinoceros. I will tell you why: because the figures that he is quoting are simply incorrect. - I want to take the shadow Treasurer through those figures. - At the beginning of 2002, official interest rates were 4.25 per cent and the proportion of all new fixed rate loans for dwellings was 7.8 per cent. Between May 2002 and November 2007 official interest rates rose 10 times to be 6.75 per cent. This drove the standard average variable mortgage rate from 6.05 per cent in 2002 to 8.5 per cent in November 2007. In the face of those ever-rising rates, what did people do? They fixed their mortgage rates in increasing numbers. This is a very important figure: by November 2007, 23.9 per cent of all new mortgages were fixed. That was a threefold increase. Think about that for a moment: a threefold increase as their interest rates went up and up and up. - You were in government. Remember? You were there. The Liberal and National parties were there in November 2007 when the proportion of all new mortgages that were fixed was 23.9 per cent. Those opposite would have everybody believe that the Rudd government somehow forced up or encouraged an increase and that occurred under us because more people were taking out fixed mortgage rates. The figures show that that claim is simply incorrect. It did not happen. - By November 2007, 23.9 per cent of all new mortgages were fixed. There was a threefold increase under the coalition. The proportion of new loans that were fixed stayed at around 23.9 per cent of new loans until March, but was never above, before falling sharply from April onwards. So what this actually exposes is the lengths to which those opposite will go to distort any economic fact for political advantage. - So, in fact, 10 interest rate rises in a row were the driver of people moving to fixed rates. That is what the figures show: 10 interest rate rises in a row. And that expectation of rate rises was brought about by the coalition and their failure to fight inflation. That is what it was brought about by: the policies of the coalition - the former Treasurer up the back, who spent like a drunken sailor precisely at the wrong time of the economic cycle. That is actually what happened. -  - Yes, but it describes you. That is the point. So have some decency and tell the truth about the figures, because the fact is that these mortgages were fixed under the Liberal and National parties, which presided over 10 interest rate rises in a row, and that is why so many people, sadly, are caught in the predicament they are in today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. Indeed, I was in Far North Queensland last week, looking at the flood damage that had been caused there. The member for McEwen and other members from Victoria would be pleased, I think, and heartened to know that on the morning of my visit to Far North Queensland I attended a fundraiser for the Victorian bushfires fund held by the Cairns Regional Council. I think it says something about the way that the entire nation has united that, even in communities that have been impacted by the floods in Far North Queensland and indeed throughout western Queensland, they are all kicking in. They all acknowledge the gravity of the situation in which those Victorian communities have found themselves.I was also in Victoria last week, in Alexandra, to meet the Mayor of Murrindindi, Councillor Lyn Gunter, and the Mayor of Mitchell, Councillor Bill Melbourne. I spoke to other mayors and shire presidents from those areas that have been hardest hit by bushfires. Certainly one of those is Murrindindi, with more than a thousand homes destroyed. The numbers are not yet quite clear because, as the member for McEwen indicated, the emergency services are not yet in a position to open up those areas. In Mitchell, some 230 houses have been lost to the fires. In the meetings that I held I was very much struck by the no-nonsense, can-do attitude of these local community leaders. They were interested in sitting down and discussing what the practical measures are by which we could provide assistance.The benefit of sitting down one on one with these community leaders was evident. For example, something that I had not thought about was that they were concerned that some of the donations made out of goodwill that had been given to the communities there - for example, new shoes - would endanger the small businesses that sell shoes in those local communities. It is similar with whitegoods, so we need to be very careful about imposing solutions from outside. I think what that really indicates is the importance of sitting down with those local communities and getting the bottom-up solutions and advice from them, and I am sure everyone in this House is committed to doing that.When I rang the local mayors and shire presidents in the immediate aftermath of Black Saturday, the single thing that they wanted was cash support. They asked in what ways we could bring forward some financial grants to those local communities. I am pleased that today the government has brought forward the fourth quarter financial assistance grants to the communities in Victoria and in Queensland that have been impacted by these natural disasters. That is some $40 million being brought forward in Victoria and some $28 million being brought forward in Queensland. We will have ongoing dialogue with those communities to make sure that we can meet their needs. We have given those communities flexibility, for example, in the way that they receive funding under the Regional Local Community Infrastructure Program. We will be flexible on the basis that we understand that they are not in a position immediately to assess what their immediate needs are.I was very much heartened by the courage and resilience of both the local leaders and some of the other emergency service workers and volunteers that I met during my visit to that shire. If any member of the House has suggestions re that engagement with local government, who will have such a critical role in the rebuilding process, then my door is open to them and I encourage them to make that contact.I also visited Ingham, in North Queensland, with the member for Kennedy. There I met with the Hinchinbrook Shire Council. The Mayor, Councillor Pino Giandomenico, took me around town with the member for Kennedy to look at the flood damage and to talk about the priorities that they have for rebuilding their community and community infrastructure. The Rudd government is committed to working with local government -  - To continue my remarks - which are certainly not partisan remarks, I would have thought - the government remains committed, as does, I believe, this House, to working with these local communities. Local government has a critical role to play. This is an extraordinary country - you can visit flood affected areas one day and those affected by bushfires the next. We all acknowledge in this House the extraordinary difficulties which are being faced by these local communities. My point is very simple: the solutions are best provided by the shires of Murrindindi or Hinchinbrook - by those local communities putting solutions to us rather than Canberra telling those local communities what is best for them. I am committed to that, and I encourage all members who have a similar view - and I know that members such as the member for McEwen and others from affected areas certainly have that view - to be a conduit to me as local government minister during these difficult times.</DOC>

 - I do not concede that those figures the deputy shadow Treasurer was putting forward are in any way accurate at all, and it is simply not possible for him to make the assertions that he has made until we see the full data from all of the departments and until we see their annual reports. Like his previous distortion of the figures when it comes to fixed interest rates and his distortion of a lot of economic research that he has been talking about in recent times, he ought to take the time to get his facts right just occasionally.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the world struggles with the global economic recession, what we have seen in the week or so since this parliament last sat is further disturbing global economic data. First of all, the Japanese economy contracted by 3.3 per cent in the December quarter. This is the largest quarterly contraction in the Japanese economy since the 1974 oil shock. Bear in mind that this is the second largest economy in the world. It is Australia's largest export market. It is of direct consequence to this economy and of direct consequence to the health of the wider Asia-Pacific and global economy. Further, we have seen data from Germany - the world's third largest economy. The German economy contracted by 2.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2008 - the largest quarter-on-quarter contraction since German unification in 1990. These movements in such large economies in the December quarter are of profound significance in shaping the economic environment which this nation confronts in 2009.This House debated at some length our approach to stimulus in both the House of Representatives and the Senate on a nation-building plan for the future. The logic was clear: to provide stimulus in the short term in order to support growth and jobs and, in the longer term, to build the infrastructure our country needs for the 21st century - to build the schools we need for the 21st century; to make sure that every primary school in the nation has the sorts of facilities that make it possible for children to get the best education on offer; to make it possible for people to know that, when their kid goes to a local primary school, they are going to have a 21st century library and they are going to have the best classrooms possible; and, through both those measures, to be able to provide stimulus for local jobs.On Saturday morning I ran into a principal from a local parish Catholic school in Lindfield, which is in the seat of Bradfield. Is it Holy Name Primary School? - Holy Family Primary School. - The member for Sturt tells us that his nephews and nieces went there. I pass on the principal's remarks because they go to the question of local stimulus. He said that, since the announcement, local carpet layers came into the school straightaway to find out what work they could get from the stimulus package. What I know from honourable members on this side of the House - and I imagine the same will apply to honourable members on that side of the House - is that, as various P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs come in the door, they will ask: why is it that those opposite voted this package down? We are seeking to provide work for the carpet layers up in the electorate of Bradfield and across the country and also work for the plumbers, the tradies, the carpenters, those who do maintenance work, the construction teams and the construction companies in order to provide support while we go about the task of implementing the biggest school modernisation program that this country has seen. That is the message contained in our nation-building plan of $42 billion, which was opposed by the Liberal and National parties in a vote in the House and in the Senate.That deals with one part of the problem, while we of course have to deal with other measures as they become necessary in the future. But this occurs in a much wider context, and I go back to the global challenge that we face, and that is the state of the global banking system. Across the world today we have the problem of toxic assets still lying on the balance sheets of many of the principal banks around the world. The problem for Australia is this: if you have bad assets on the balance sheets of globally significant banks, it affects directly not only credit flows to those national companies but also credit flows right across the world - and credit flows to banks and other financial institutions and borrowers in countries like Australia. The foreign participation from globally significant banks in the foreign syndication of loans to Australia is significant in number. Therefore, if we are serious about dealing with the challenges which lie ahead, the world must act on the question of toxic assets polluting the balance sheets of globally systemic banks.For the benefit of honourable members, let me put this into statistical context. So far there has been a debate around the world about fiscal stimulus measures across the OECD, which currently add up to something like $2 trillion. For the benefit of honourable members opposite, the total value and potential losses of US-originated credit assets now ranges between US$2.2 trillion and US$3.6 trillion. The impact which that in turn has on private credit flows to the real economy is huge and therefore has the potential to have a huge impact on further cuts in economic growth.I am concerned, as the Australian government is concerned, that, unless we see effective global action on the question of toxic assets on balance sheets, it will flow through further to the real economy. As others opposite find this enormously distracting, can I say this: until the toxic assets question is dealt with in these banks, we - the global economy and this economy within it - in our fiscal stimulus measures will be dealing with a part of the problem which those globally significant and systemically important banks and the systems which supervise them have not dealt with. As the debate unfolds about action necessary to deal with toxic assets on balance sheets in the United States, Europe, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and elsewhere, this is of direct consequence to small and medium businesses in this country seeking to access lines of credit which will be denied to them if we do not have the resumption of normal credit flows through the participation of foreign banks and foreign banks' syndication of loans.For the benefit of the House, it is important that we are seized by the significance of this. That is why, in the period ahead, action on toxic assets on balance sheets is of critical importance in restoring private credit flows. If we do not see the restoration of private credit flows in the global economy, the challenges that we have faced to date will pale into insignificance compared with those which will confront us in the future. If those opposite regard these remarks as not relevant to the current debate, I would draw their attention to the emerging and serious debate in Washington, in London, in Brussels and in every financial capital in the world that, unless this is dealt with, we are facing the gravest of crises indeed.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. The Treasury is issuing Treasury bonds. It was issuing Treasury bonds, of course, when the member for Higgins was the Treasurer. -  - The head honcho up the back. We indicated in the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook that we would be having a temporary deficit and that we would be increasing borrowings through the issuance of government securities. The proportion of that will depend upon conditions in the market at the time, and that will change over time. The Treasury have been out there in recent weeks issuing securities, raising money. The proportions that they have raised from overseas or domestically will change per issuance, and that will continue. So it is not possible to give you the exact figure right now, today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. It is a very important question; it goes to all of the steps that this government has taken to restore and reinforce confidence in our financial system and to maintain stability in our banking system, including guaranteeing bank deposits and wholesale funding. And, of course, it goes directly to the point that the Prime Minister was making before about our Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which has been put in place in response to events in the international economy in recent times.All of these measures have been absolutely essential for maintaining stability in the wider economy and in the financial system, and this program has had the support of respected economists the world over; certainly, last Friday we had the benefit of hearing the views of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Those opposite have been questioning the rationale for this program. There has been question after question in this House about whether there was sufficient stimulus - too much, too early, too late and so on. I think the governor had a number of very important things to say, and the most important thing that he had to say on Friday was:Growth will be stronger than it would have been without those actions. I do not think there is any doubt about that.We have had the deputy shadow Treasurer, the Leader of the Opposition and others all making points about our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. The first thing that they have been saying is that our Economic Security Strategy that was announced last August did not work. What did the Governor of the Reserve Bank have to say about this last Friday? He said:I think the indications are that the pre-Christmas package did have quite a measurable impact on consumer demand.How many times have those opposite come into this House and said it did not have a measurable impact on consumer demand? Despite the retail sales from December, despite the evidence from Woolworths, Westfield and so on, they continue to say that in this House, and of course it is untrue. You have heard a lot from those opposite about the bank guarantee and how ineffective it was, how bungled it was, how it does not work and how it is not necessary. This is what the governor had to say last Friday:_ the decision, by and large, did what was needed, which was that it avoided any perception of a systemic problem in the Australian banking system __            _            _That is a very much better outcome than we might have otherwise had.And, of course, we have heard from them - we heard it again today, in fact - that the Nation Building and Jobs Plan is excessive. They claim we are spending too much, that there is too much investment in schools. Indeed, the deputy shadow Treasurer thinks the investments in schools are ridiculous. What did the governor say on Friday? He said:_ it does not strike me as obvious that somehow it is grossly excessive.This is another exposure of the naked political point-scoring that has been coming from those opposite. Every time they bowled up another one of their shonky assertions it was exposed for what it was by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Their claims about doing too much were smashed; their claim the ESS did not work was smashed; their claim that the bank guarantee is not needed was completely smashed. The ultimate came when the deputy shadow Treasurer asked the governor a question about whether we were spending too much too soon. This is what the governor said:You can make that argument, but I think you can also make the argument that, the longer you wait, the more ammunition you will end up having to use. These things can get a sort of self-fulfilling momentum behind them and we may or may not be able to head that off. But I think you should try _Of course the approach of those opposite is simply to sit and wait and see, because they do not understand that if you do not act early then you do not avoid some of the catastrophic effects that come down the track, particularly the tragedy of much higher unemployment. There could not have been a more humiliating debut for the deputy shadow Treasurer -  - than there was on Friday before the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It just shows that the shadow Treasurer needs to do some hard work, needs to check his facts, needs to delve into the economic research. You cannot have an approach like the opposition has, which is simply to wait and see. Those opposite have not got a clue about what needs to be done. They do not have any ability to judge the magnitude of the problems that this country is facing, given the nature of the global recession. But the proof was there. It was exposed last Friday by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Those opposite should start doing their homework and get into a position where they can say something that is responsible and helps the country, not hinders it.</DOC>

 - I certainly do stand by that statement, and I understand that the opposition are opposed to our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. They would rather see higher unemployment than see some temporary constructive action that leaves a lasting legacy for the country. The cabinet did discuss this issue when we were considering this tremendous initiative to increase energy efficiency. We did have a look at the capacity of the domestic industry. We had a look at the number of domestic producers, and it is the case that there will be domestic producers who will be substantially expanding their production. They have said that to the government and I am sure they have said that to the minister behind me. They certainly will. There is no doubt there will be some imports. There is no doubt about it at all, but the great bulk will be manufactured domestically. The deputy shadow Treasurer -  -  - The deputy shadow Treasurer was relying on a report from Citigroup. I have not read the report from Citigroup, but there is another report that the deputy shadow Treasurer has been using - from ABN AMRO - on our stimulus package, and I can tell him, 'Don't use it any more because it is just completely wrong.' So it may well be that the figuring in this report is not right, but we will go away and have a look at it and look at the basis on which they made their calculations. But those opposite will take any opportunity to pointscore about what is a very serious initiative to create jobs in this country. The installation of pink batts is labour intensive and we can do it at a time when it will bring a tremendous economic benefit to this country. The installation of these batts is the equivalent, over time, of taking one million cars off the roads. So it is a very important energy efficiency initiative, but it is also a very important job creation initiative. All of these questions are really about them trying to wriggle out from underneath the fact that they are completely opposed to our Nation Building and Jobs Plan - a plan which is absolutely the right thing to do by this country. We have the endorsement of the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, ACCI and other small business organisations, but not of the federal opposition. It just shows you how negative they are and what policy alternatives they do not have.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for his great interest in education. I also note that, despite the recent promotion of the member for Sturt, it is, of course, this side of the House that asks about education, because it is this side of the House that is interested in education. And, of course, on this side of the House, we are committed to ensuring that Australia is investing in its people. What we know from past economic downturns is that as the economy turns down so does the investment in skills and training. As a result, the skills cycle mirrors the economic cycle so that when the economy is turning down there is less investment in skills and training. When the economy moves back into growth then everybody screams about skills shortages because they cannot get the skilled labour that they need. In these difficult days following the global financial crisis, we want to make sure that we are investing in the skills and capacities of the Australian people. Even in these days, Australia cannot afford to not invest in our people and their skills. It was my pleasure to announce some new measures late last week to ensure that we are continuing to invest in the skills, particularly, of apprentices.In this difficult period it is, of course, possible that with the best will in the world an employer, faced with a downturn in demand, may need to put off some apprentices. For those apprentices it might mean that, although they have committed one or two years of their study, unless they can secure a new position to complete that apprenticeship that study will have gone to waste. These special measures are to create incentives so that an apprentice who finds themselves in that position has a better way of securing an opportunity to complete that education and training. Most particularly, on top of all existing incentive payments, we are putting in place an additional $2,800 incentive payment for employers or group training organisations to give an out-of-trade apprentice an option, a possibility, a position to complete their apprenticeship. It would be completion right the way through, with $1,000 of that $2,800 to be paid when the apprentice completes their apprenticeship. In addition, for those apprentices who find themselves out of trade but who are not able to secure a position with a new employer or with a group training organisation that can give them on-the-job experience across a range of employers, we are also investing in training providers in registered training organisations to create new pathways for those apprentices to complete their study even though they do not have the benefit of a connection with an employer or a group training organisation. We believe that these are important measures from a government that is committed to jobs and committed to education.Of course, we do not know what the opposition stands for in this area. We do know, of course, that they voted against jobs when they voted against the stimulus package, and we do know that their regard for education is reckless to say the least, with the newly appointed shadow Treasurer being a man who has said that investing in schools is 'ridiculous'. That was his - Government members - Shame! - Amazing! That was his response to our -  - I would have thought that, given the reaction in the Liberal Party to the appointment of the member for Sturt as the Manager of Opposition Business, he would not be talking about apprenticeships himself at the current stage. I must admit that I did want to see the member for Warringah making a comeback. In a choice between macho and mincing, I would have gone for macho myself, and obviously the Leader of the Opposition, faced with the choice of a doberman or poodle, has gone for the poodle. Presumably he prefers Abba to Cold Chisel, because that is the kind of thing we see on display. -  - I do digress, Mr Speaker, and I apologise to you for that, but we are getting some amusing interjections from the opposition backbench about musical choices now. I think they are willing me on in this comparison between the member for Warringah and the member for Sturt. -  - My point, of course, is about investment in Australian education, and we not only have the member for Sturt clearly promoted to a position beyond his capabilities but we have the shadow Treasurer opposed to investment in schools and now, of course, opposed to funding for schools, because he said that if they had been in government they:_ would not have made the generous $15.1 billion Council of Australian Governments deal with the states announced last December to deliver health, hospitals, education, housing and other services _This is his exact quote. I will await the shadow Treasurer telling the House what bit of the COAG deal he is opposed to. Is it the $600 million of new funds for primary schools? Is it the $1.1 billion of new funds for disadvantaged schools? Is it the $550 million of new funds for teacher quality? Is it the $540 million for literacy and numeracy? As well as being opposed to capital investment in schools, what else is he seeking to rip off Australian school kids and the people who teach them?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. He is right: there is now a legitimate debate about what we do about vegetation management over time and how we deploy effectively what used to be described when I was a kid growing up as 'periodic burn-offs'. I am sure that is a term used around the country. What I would also say to the honourable member is that I am reluctant, from the position that I occupy, to dictate what the answer should be. What I will say to the honourable member is that, once the deliberation is concluded, and it must be within a finite time - and I return to the comments I made in relation to the earlier intervention from the member for McEwen - as a parliament, and the government through the parliament, let us then establish the mechanism to ensure that the action is then taken. The member for McEwen came up with her proposal, which was the tying of particular grants. I think I said in response to that earlier on in parliament today that we should look at ways in which, once agreed action at a policy level is determined, that is then given effect on the ground through clear financial arrangements with other levels of government. Let us get the content of that right.The second part of the honourable member's question goes to the knowledge from Indigenous Australians. I listened carefully, as I am sure the Leader of the Opposition did yesterday, to the comments made by the Aboriginal elders as they provided their sombre welcoming to those attending the service yesterday. Given that our Aboriginal brothers and sisters have occupied this continent for 40,000 years, there is great wisdom to be learned. We also need to ensure that that wisdom is combined with that of early pioneering families and their experience of the new forms of cultivation which have been introduced to Australia as well and what happens as a consequence of the impact on natural vegetation of new forms of cultivation. All these things need to be drawn together. What we cannot allow to happen is for this to drift on into the future without resolve. As a parliament and as a government we need to bring these things together and to agree on a course of action.As a little kid growing up - and I have said this to many of the communities I have been around in the last week or two - my memories of being with my father are of every so often going out with him with the hip burner to burn off. That is what they did in those days. Where that wisdom, applied to that particular part of South-East Queensland, those practices, the repositories of knowledge within the departments of primary industries and pure local knowledge came from, I cannot give the answer. I have seen it and it was part of the local -  - I am trying to answer the honourable member's question as best I can. - To return to the spirit in which the question was asked by the member for New England, my recollection as a kid is that these were the things that were done in that area. I am always reluctant to generalise from my experience of growing up in one part of Australia to what happened and to what is appropriate elsewhere. Let us draw all of this knowledge from settler communities, farming communities and Indigenous communities together through the deliberative processes which have been established by the government of Victoria. Once that has concluded, let us as a government, through the parliament, act in concert with the states and territories and through instruments, including financial instruments, which can make it work in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. As he is the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, which is currently undertaking an inquiry into obesity, I know that the work of that committee will feed into our reform strategy.The Rudd government is committed to significant health reforms as a crucial step in rebuilding our health and hospital system. Frankly, after 12 years of neglect, there is a lot of rebuilding to be done; we have to reverse a lot of the inaction of the previous government. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the foundations are being laid for that rebuilding. Late last year we had the $64 billion investment, through COAG, into health, including $750 million into emergency departments and more than $1 billion into training our health professionals. That is the biggest ever investment in prevention, and they have all been important components to rebuilding the system. That investment was a 50 per cent increase on what was planned by the previous government, had they negotiated the agreement.Not only do we want to invest now in the sorts of things that will help rebuild our system, but we have also increased the reporting measures in COAG to ensure that the states are constantly improving. We know that the states need to improve the provisioning of their services. We have tied that extra funding to changes in the way that the states and territories behave. We have increased GP training places by 250 places, and they are available across the country. That is something that I know is very welcome at least on this side of the House and in the many communities who will receive more trainees in their area.Last week another important step in our investments in health and in our health reform was taken. The National Health and Hospital Reform Commission released their interim report outlining over 100 potential future directions to be taken in health. Many of these directions are common sense. Some of them support existing government directions in health, like our investments in GP Superclinics, and some of these ideas are very ambitious. The opportunity is now there for the community to have a say and to provide feedback at this critical stage of the commission's work. We asked the commission to think big, and I encourage the public, health professionals and service providers to provide their ideas and views at this important stage of the debate.I note that the member for Dickson has admitted that the sluggish approach of the previous government was a problem - and I congratulate him for being prepared to do that. He said:If we look at the history of health in this country we have to be honest and admit we have made mistakes _ That is of course to state the obvious - He went on to say:For instance, in years past, despite some of the best intentions -  - I am finishing the quote. This comes directly from your speech to the General Practice Network.we made mistakes in Indigenous health, in areas like workforce planning and in hospital management.Again, the member for Dickson was out last week saying:Patients as well would have seen a dysfunctional system over the last 10 years, particularly when you talk about public hospitals.Paradoxically, after having been prepared to acknowledge these mistakes, the member for Dickson also said last week:I thought the priority, if you are talking about the here and now of health priorities would be to fix our hospitals and to fix them quickly.So, after 12 years of doing nothing but pulling money out of our public hospitals, he now wants everything fixed overnight. But here is the really puzzling thing about the debate from the other side of the House: we now have the member for Dickson urgently committed to investing in our hospitals. But unfortunately - and I admit that this is the first time that I have ever felt sorry for the member for Dickson - the member for Dickson now has to deal with a new shadow Treasurer who, unlike the Treasurer on this side of the House, does not believe in investing in hospitals. The Deputy Prime Minister has already referred to this quote from an interview with Lenore Taylor, where the shadow Treasurer is reported to have said that:_ all other things would not have been equal under a Coalition government. For example, it would not have made the generous $15.1 billion Council of Australian Governments deal with the states announced last December to deliver health, hospitals, education, housing and other services, although he won't say how much it would have spent.The member for Lyons then left the chamber. - The relevance of this issue is that we are committed to health reform, we are committed to investments in health. The other side has a shadow Treasurer who does not believe in investing in hospitals, unlike our Treasurer, who has already delivered $64 billion into our hospitals, and there will be more of that to come.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for her question. It is the case that, in terms of mortgage rates, there has been a very substantial pass-through by all of the major banks of the 400 basis points cut that has been delivered by the Reserve Bank in the last few months. It is also the case that, for some business borrowers, it has not flowed through at the same rate. I share the same concerns as the member for Forrest. It is the case that a lot of business loans are linked to market rates but some are not. So I would be very interested in seeing the details of this example which has been mentioned by the member for Forrest, and I will take it up with Westpac Bank.I am very keen to see that credit in the Australian banking system flows to where it is needed. It is true to say that, as a consequence of the bank guarantee, and particularly the guarantee for term funding, Australian banks have been quite successful in raising their funding requirements both onshore and offshore in recent months. In fact, they have raised a record amount of money doing that. The government would certainly like to see credit flowing more strongly to some sections of business. It is the case that, at the aggregate level, credit flows do look strong but I, like the member for Forrest, do hear too many complaints from sections of small business where this is not the case. It may be a consequence of a number of factors. It could be a consequence of general economic conditions. It may be a consequence that some of the regional banks are not lending in areas where they previously lent. It is certainly the case that people who are trying to change their bank are experiencing difficulties in this environment. The government is talking to the banking sector about that, and I would be more than happy to look at this example and take it up with the bank.I recently took up another example that had been raised with me, because I was concerned about what was going on, where there was a failure to get credit. The government is quite concerned about this. On that occasion, with that example, there was a successful outcome. Certainly, our response cannot always be on an individual basis. We are looking to a systematic solution that we can put in place to deal with these issues where people are unjustifiably being denied credit when they should get it. Of course, trying to establish that has some difficulties, but the government is serious about it, and I look forward to hearing the details from the member.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question, particularly on behalf of the more than 11,000 age pensioners in his electorate. As he knows, pensioners in his electorate, like pensioners across Australia, are certainly facing very hard economic times. While there certainly remains more to be done, the government has made a start. We made a significant down payment to pensioners by way of the December Economic Security Strategy payments. They went to four out of every five Australians aged over 65.Pensioners will also receive some benefit from the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, so that every pensioner who paid even $1 of tax in the last financial year will get the $900 tax bonus. Of course, many of the 20,000 social housing units will benefit pensioners. That builds on a number of things which we have already put in place - last year - for pensioners. If I can just inform the House, excluding normal indexation the government provided an additional $2,337 to single pensioners and $3,537 to pensioner couples. We have done that since coming to office, recognising the very significant pressure that pensioners are under. These have been significant gains for pensioners, and we know they would not have been delivered by the opposition.It has been made absolutely crystal clear by the member for Warringah that the sorts of theatrics we saw from the opposition last year in relation to pensioners were nothing more than a political stunt. The member for Warringah, who is actually the shadow minister in this area, although nobody in this parliament would know it, actually arose from his usual slumber last week, went on to radio 2GB and said that he did not support an increase in the pension -  - For the benefit of the House, I will just quote what the member for Warringah actually said on radio 2GB. He said, 'A $35 a week increase would be an enormous hit on the revenue.' 
A government member - He says it's true! - And he says it is true again. Plainly, here today, again, he is saying that he does not support an increase in the pension. He does not acknowledge that there is a need for pensioners to get an increase. Of course, we know that the member for Warringah does not think that this portfolio and pensions are the main political game. We know just how out of touch he has become with the needs of pensioners. The new shadow spokesperson for finance apparently backed him in straightaway by saying that he was just stating the bleeding obvious.The Leader of the Opposition might think that he pulled the member for Warringah into line the other day, but I will just let the Leader of the Opposition know that the member for Warringah has been on the airwaves again, this morning, in Melbourne, saying once again that he was just stating the bleeding obvious. The bleeding obvious is that the opposition does not support an increase for pensioners. The government understand how tough it is for pensioners, and we will deliver.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would welcome the question if I thought it was a genuine attempt to seek information and/or -  -  -  - Of course, the shadow minister for defence is getting regular briefings from the Department of Defence on this issue, and he will be receiving another briefing tomorrow. - Like, I am sure, every member of this House, I was distressed last year when I heard that our special forces soldiers were possibly -  -  - Well, there have been briefings. I can guarantee to the House that there have been briefings. - I will leave it for the member for Paterson to explain himself, but there have been briefings, Mr Speaker. He should consult his shadow minister for defence. Again, we are all collectively distressed at the thought that our special forces soldiers could be incorrectly having moneys deducted from their pay. When I heard of this matter, I told the House -  -  - that it will be fixed, and it will be fixed. -  - Unfortunately, the matter is very complex. I am sure there is not one member of this House who would suggest that I or any member of this House would delay in any way the process of fixing this problem. While this problem has its genesis -  -  - While this problem has its genesis in a decision of the independent Defence review tribunal, the real cause is the system we inherited from the former government. Of course, the decision of the tribunal required implementation. The reality is that the ICT and other systems have not been able to deliver. That is the fact of it. - Fixing that is taking some time and no-one is more frustrated than I am.The member for Flinders then left the chamber. - Yes, that is right: the computer says no - the computer system we inherited from you. The fact is that underinvestment in ICT in Defence is causing problems right throughout the Defence organisation. -  - They said this is not about politics but it seems, by their intervention, that that is exactly what this is about. Again, every member of this House, I am sure, wants to fix this problem as quickly as is possible. - I did give a guarantee and I will fix this problem.The member for Forrest then left the chamber. - The Chief of Army has personally taken responsibility for and dedicated himself to - because it is not, in the first instance, a special forces organisation problem - fixing this problem. Yes, I have been critical publicly about delays and the inability to fix this problem more quickly, but if only it were so easy. -  - It is not straightforward; do not be silly. - There is a suggestion that I somehow signed a backdated provision, which is just ridiculous. The tribunal makes its decisions on a regular basis retrospectively. It is required under the act not to make any retrospective decision that could disadvantage a member of the Australian Defence Force. In this case, there should not have been any disadvantage, because what the tribunal had suggested or directed is that allowances be merged with salary, which would have been and should have been of advantage to the soldiers. But, when the computer systems tried to merge the allowances with the salaries, there was an inability to recognise the competencies which are required to secure those allowances. In some cases it was because the competencies were gained or earned informally and sometimes it was because the competencies were just not accepted by the computer system.Some time ago I suggested that a non-reduction period should be established acting both retrospectively and prospectively to ensure that there are no debts and that soldiers have time to gain the competencies required, to establish them formally. The most recent advice the Chief of Army has is that he now has the power to give more formal recognition to competencies which were formerly considered to be informal. So these are very complex issues. They are issues that we have inherited because of underinvestment in these systems over many years. I said I would fix this problem. The Chief of Army is acting in good faith to fix it as quickly as possible. In the meantime we have put provisions in place to ensure no Defence member is financially disadvantaged.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her interest and concern in respect of this case, as I do many members of both sides of the House. I welcome very much the fact that last week the King of Thailand granted Mr Nicolaides a pardon. I am sure all members of the House will be very pleased that over the weekend he was returned to Australia and to his family. This of course has been a deeply distressing time for him and for members of his family; in particular, for his elderly parents, who have found this situation quite traumatic.From the moment that Mr Nicolaides was taken into custody on 31 August last year he received consular assistance from our officials in Thailand, from the ambassador down, and his family members received consular assistance from our officials in Australia. The government strongly supported his application for pardon once the Thai judicial and legal processes had been completed. I raised the matter on a number of occasions with my Thai counterpart, requesting that it be given early and favourable consideration. We are very grateful that the Thai authorities have processed this matter very quickly. Indeed, it is a measure of the good relationship between Australia and Thailand. I am advised by officials that, in the paperwork associated with the pardon, reference is made to the granting of the pardon having as one of its reasons the good and friendly relationship between Australia and Thailand.Mr Nicolaides was sentenced on 19 January to three years imprisonment, his application for pardon was made two days later on the 21st, the pardon was granted on Wednesday of last week, paperwork was completed on Friday of last week and he returned to Australia, as members would know, over the weekend. On behalf of the House, I thank very much our ambassador and our officials in Thailand for their very good work in this matter. Their consular assistance to Mr Nicolaides went from the moment of his arrest until he got on the plane on Saturday.I also acknowledge members on both sides of the House for their interest, for their concern and, very importantly, for their understanding of the way in which the government was seeking to promote, pursue and advance Mr Nicolaides's interests. His case underlines the very important point which I have made to the House before: when an Australian citizen becomes involved in the legal, criminal and judicial processes of another nation there is a limit to what the Australian government can do - not that we cannot do anything, but there is a limit.In the course of Mr Nicolaides's judicial processes before the Thai criminal system I had urgings from members of the Australian legal profession to seek to interfere in those processes, including in the granting of bail. If these suggestions were made by foreign governments in respect of Australian court processes there would be at least the raising of an eyebrow, and if these suggestions were made of the Australian government in respect of Australian bail processes that would either be highly inappropriate or possibly a serious criminal offence.I was also invited on more than one occasion by legal practitioners, academics or historians to be highly critical of the Thai legal and judicial system and to be highly critical of the offence in respect of which Mr Nicolaides was charged. I chose not to go down that path. I chose not to go down that path because Australia respects the right of the sovereign nation-state of Thailand to organise its internal domestic laws in the manner it sees fit. If I had been critical of the Thai judicial system or of the offence in question, I think that would not have helped the application for clemency once it was made.I conclude on this point: when Australians travel overseas they need to ensure that they both are aware of and comply with the laws of the country to which they travel. If for some reason they believe that those laws are either obscurantist or inappropriate and they do not propose to comply with them then they should not travel to that country in the first place. Just as we expect others when they come here to comply with our laws and to abide by our customs and processes, so equally Australians need to adopt the same approach when they travel overseas. In that respect, I again urge all Australians travelling overseas to consult the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advisory system and to register their travel prior to travelling overseas.</DOC>

 - As the Leader of the Opposition will be aware, firstly, when it comes to measures which were announced last October and which flowed through in payments in December and, secondly and most recently, with the passage of the measures which went through the Senate, I seem to recall, a week or so ago, the flow-through effect on the economy will occur during the course of this year. We will also see what occurs with the fourth quarter data for 2008. This is a responsible course of action. The alternative, as recommended by the Liberal Party, is to do nothing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for the question. It is some months since the member for Corangamite and I visited areas in Colac, including the dairy farm belonging to Mark and Sam Billing. Last week my office was in contact with the family. I spoke to Sam. Mark was doing what so many farmers had done; he had started off fighting some of the local fires and, by the time my office spoke to him, he had gone across to Gippsland to help with fighting the fires there. Many farmers around the country have seen that same story and, just as farmers were involved in fighting the fires, they are also part of the grieving and will be a vital part of the recovery.Last Wednesday and Thursday I visited properties in the electorates of McMillan and Gippsland together with the local members and with Simon Ramsay of the VFF. There has been a constant story across so many of the farms that have been affected by the fires. No farmer, realistically, can insure everything on the property - if you did, you would run into loss even in a good year - and the constant story has been that, if anything has been saved on a farm, it is likely to have been the bits that were insured, as though the fire was almost going after the sections of the properties that were not insured.We visited Brian and Julie Witchell's apple orchard in Labertouche. To get a sense of the heat, things that were not flammable at all, like their metal packing shed, had melted to the ground. On apple trees which had not actually been seared by the flames, the apples themselves had cooked till they looked more like passionfruit. But there on the other side of the hill, in the areas that fortunately had not been affected by the fires, you had that sign of optimism with the volunteer workforce. Both there and the following day on a Gormandale dairy farm, there was an army of volunteers - be it on the apple orchard restaking trees or on the dairy farm helping with removing fencing.But the point made yesterday by the member for McEwen was well made and well taken - that, important as the volunteer effort is, long-term recovery needs to be built on jobs. With that in mind, the money that is available immediately - the $5,000 upfront payment and then the $25,000 for farms and businesses - allows people to at least begin the process of rebuilding on these properties. The concessional loans of up to $200,000 at a 3.2 per cent interest rate - so below the cash rate - allow people to go a step further. Also, the Landcare-style work is of extraordinary importance. I referred to this in the House when I last stood here but, having seen both some of the forestry areas and the farms where there is no sign that there was ever any undergrowth there at all, ironically, in the areas where the fires have now been extinguished, the worst thing that could happen would be a massive downpour, which would simply remove the soil and carry it directly to the river.I also, when I last stood here, referred to the electorate of Gippsland and the two areas which had come out of EC in September of last year. I said that I would speak to the Victorian minister about getting a request for those to come back in. That request came from the Victorian government, and interim EC assistance is now available in both the Macalister Irrigation District and Latrobe.I will mention something that gives you a sense of the resilience of some of the people involved. The member for Gippsland and I, as we drove through some of the areas, saw - I think it was in Traralgon - a sign out the front of an area where properties had been completely levelled that the owners had put up themselves. It said: 'Renovator's delight. Large skylight. Charcoal interior. Alfresco dining.' The member for Gippsland and I went to see the owner, who was cleaning up, and asked him if he had put the sign up. He responded, 'No, my wife put that up. She has got a better sense of humour than me at the moment.'There are huge challenges ahead, but there is some extraordinary resilience from some incredible Australians who will be leading that recovery.</DOC>

 - The government has embarked on a $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan because it is the right thing to do for Australia. It is a plan of action for the economy at a time of global economic recession. The alternative put forward by those opposite is to do nothing. That is where we have got to in this debate.On the elements of the program itself, firstly, we have a $15 billion plan -  - In terms of the contents of the government's nation-building plan, there is $15 billion of investment in a building program affecting every primary school in the country. We voted for that; you voted it down.The second element is to invest $6 billion into the biggest social housing investment the country has ever seen. We voted for that; you voted it down. - The third element of the government's nation-building plan is our intention to create energy efficient housing for the nation. That is designed to bring about a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to the equivalent of some 49 million tonnes of GHGs, the equivalent of taking a million cars off the road. The means by which we propose to do that is to ensure that owner-occupied dwellings across the country have ceiling insulation. That is why we have embarked upon this practical program.On the specifics of the program, I draw the Leader of the Opposition, in the interesting new twist in his engagement in this debate, to the comments by the CEO of the Insulation Council of Australia dated 13 February where the CEO says that the package will create around 4,000 jobs, and that 'the economic multiplier will ripple well past the insulation industry's raw material suppliers, manufacturers, installers and delivery drivers'. Let us just reflect for a moment, for example, on people who work in the retail sector in Australia. They sell products which are made in Australia and overseas. We last year decided to support retail and consumption by two sets of measures, one in the measures we released in December and again most recently which will flow through in March and April. Why? Because in each and every one of the electorates represented opposite there are shops, small shops, which sell goods that are made in Australia and overseas. But the jobs in those shops are equally important to this government whatever the product they happen to sell, because we take an interest in all those folk who depend on the continuing turnover of economic activity to actually have a job. That is why we did that.On the question of the insulation industry, again I would draw the attention of the honourable member to the statement delivered by the Insulation Council of Australia. The labour intensity of installing insulation batts is huge. The labour intensity of actually getting the stuff out to households is huge. Material suppliers: the impact there is significant. And on top of all of that we believe that those who are engaged in the domestic manufacture will be advantaged as well. It is the total jobs impact of this measure, the social housing measure and on top of that the school building measure which has underpinned the government's determination to provide practical support for jobs at this time of the global economic recession. The government has taken decisive economic action to support the economy at a time when we are suffering assault from forces of the global economy beyond our shores. Those opposite wish to sit in their comfortable seats and do nothing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. He has firsthand understanding of the unspeakably traumatic time that his constituents have gone through, and of course so many other Victorian families. For so many they have lost everything - parents, children, friends, neighbours - and their lives have certainly been shattered. It is going to take a very long time for them to overcome the grief and loss and dislocation from these fires. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for McEwen spoke of this eloquently yesterday.I want to inform the House that we are working very closely with the Victorian government, in particular their Department of Human Services, putting counsellors, social workers and case managers into the fire affected communities. Centrelink has 88 professional staff in the field already, made up of 39 social workers and 49 case managers. This is an initiative which both the Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria have been very keen to see put in place quickly. We want each fire survivor to be assigned a case manager to give them one-on-one assistance and to connect them with services, and that will include both counselling and psychological support. From next Monday, we expect to have 80 case managers in the field. That is really all about making sure that people get the support that they need.The Minister for Health and Ageing, I am pleased to say, has announced that there will be a boost to mental health support for fire victims. She has announced $7½ million extra for primary health services, support and training for professionals, increased counselling services through Lifeline and Kids Help Line, and support for local organisations to help their communities both reconnect and psychologically recover. In addition, we have provided extra money to five family relationship service providers. Each have received $40,000 extra to deliver counselling in the Bendigo area, Seymour, the Healesville and Yarra Junction area up in the north-east, and the areas around Churchill and Bunyip.I think we can all imagine just how difficult it is for families, particularly children. I have heard some horrific cases where parents had to make very difficult split-second decisions about whether to leave with their children or to put them in the care of others while they stay and fight for their homes. Some children have seen horrific sights away from their parents. It is important that both the children and their parents receive this extra support at this very difficult time. It will be the case that the physical injuries will be healed while the emotional scars take a lot, lot longer for people to recover from. We certainly intend to provide this emotional and psychological support over the long term.</DOC>

 - The government embraced the Economic Security Strategy last October; payments flowed through in December with the object of supporting consumption, in particular for the retail sector. This was at a time when retail sales across the Western world went through the floor. If you look, however, at what happened in the December quarter last year, data produced by the ABS show that retail trade rose by 3.8 per cent. I would ask honourable members to reflect on where retail sales around the world went in the December quarter last year. Furthermore, all industries had increased sales in December 2008 - food retailing, 1.4; department stores, plus 8.3; clothing and soft-good retailing up 5.8; household-good retailing up 9.9; and other retailing, 2.6. Where it is actually apposite is data that I have referred to in this House before from Westfield, which, as you know, is represented both in Australia and in the United States. The Westfield data showed that spending in December 2008 was up 2.5 per cent from the previous year, in contrast with their overseas sales, which were down 14 per cent in the United States. - On the question of the impact of the government's measures, I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition would have equated performance in the retail sector with jobs. I know that might be a novel concept for the Leader of the Opposition. With collapsing sales, as has been the case in America, Britain and elsewhere in the retail sector, the huge impact is on employment in those economies and that is already being seen. What we have done is taken action in that sector in order to support the retail community, as reflected by so many of the peak bodies from across that sector and beyond. These are practical steps which have been taken by the government with one objective: to reduce the unemployment impact, which would otherwise flow from the global economic recession. Again, I go back to the alternative: you can have a Nation Building and Jobs Plan aimed at reducing the impact of the global recession on the Australian economy and on families or the Liberal alternative, which is to let the free market rip. We have a strategy; you have an excuse.</DOC>

 - What is unfortunate about the tonality of the formal contributions and the interjections from those opposite is they seem to delight in the economic pain of others. I would suggest to those opposite that rather than see economic trouble as equalling a political opportunity, they might contribute instead to a positive strategy to reduce the impact on families from this global economic recession, and those whose jobs are under threat through no cause associated with themselves, through no fault of their own.The government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan aims to do three things. Firstly, it aims to ensure the continued stability of the Australian financial sector - the double bank guarantees which we supported and those opposite in substance opposed. Secondly, there is the $42 billion plan to boost investment in critical infrastructure, including schools and housing, in order to provide jobs in the near term and important infrastructure which we need for the long term. The third part of what we are seeking to do is to support those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. That underpins the announcements made by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and me today here in Canberra.Firstly, we have announced an additional $219 million to be invested in employment services. This investment will ensure that workers made redundant receive personalised assistance and advice to help them find work as soon as possible. Under the changes, a newly redundant worker will have immediate access to intensive job assistance, equivalent to what is referred to as 'stream 2 services', such as: a comprehensive skills assessment, skills development training, IT support and stationery support to help with job applications, targeted referral to appropriate education and training and $550 of credit to the Employment Pathway Fund to pay for items such as computer courses, heavy vehicle licences, safety boots and uniforms.Secondly, in addition, we have today announced that we will be providing 10,000 new structural adjustment places for retrenched workers through the Productivity Places Program at a cost of $75 million. These certificate III and IV places are additional to the 701,000 places we have already committed through this program. The announcements we have made today build on this commitment and will benefit up to 58,000 out-of-trade apprentices and trainees. The key thing here is to assist people who are finding it difficult to retain their traineeship or apprenticeship under current circumstances.Thirdly, employees and group training organisations which take an out-of-trade apprentice may be entitled to receive up to an additional $2,800 per apprentice. An additional $1,800 is available for employers to group training organisations taking on an eligible out-of-trade apprentice or trainee. These are three practical measures. The third of them was announced by the Deputy Prime Minister last week. The two that I referred to at the beginning of my remarks were announced by the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister for employment and me today. What are they designed to do? They are designed to provide further forms of practical support for those who lose their jobs or whose opportunity for traineeships or apprenticeships are being undermined by the global economic recession.The government remains resolved to take further action as is necessary to support people and families who are at risk as a consequence of the global economic recession's impact on them, their families and their jobs. We have a positive plan to support these people under these circumstances as opposed to the alternative, which seems to be a consistent threat of argument from those opposite: do nothing and complain about everything. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Any Australian worker who loses their job as a consequence of the current global economic recession - and more generally - is of direct concern to everyone who sits on this side of the House and, I assume, honourable member's opposite as well. The practical challenge we face is how to deal with each concentration of unemployment - for example, that to which the honourable member refers - and at the same time to provide underpinning support for the economy as a whole.On support for the economy as a whole, I have outlined to the House before, our $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Secondly, what I have also outlined to the House on previous occasions is our $4.8 billion nation-building plan announced last year, which focused on infrastructure. Thirdly, there is the Economic Security Strategy we released last October, with payments coming out in December. Each of those measures, including in the automobile sector - these levels of support to consumption in the economy - assist overall performance in the retail sector of the economy.But, on top of that, at the end of last year the government - and from memory it was in September-October - released the $6.1 billion New Car Plan for a Greener Future. As a consequence of that plan, which we negotiated at length with the principal representative of the automobile industry in Australia and their parents abroad, we put in place the most secure investment environment possible for the automobile industry - and, as a consequence, the suppliers to that industry - going out to the year 2020. Honourable members will know the state of the auto industry around the world. The automobile industry in the United States is collapsing. The automobile industry in many parts of Europe is going through the same experience. We have also seen recent reports about the difficulties Toyota and others are experiencing within Japan. This is the reality -  - In response to the state of the auto industry and the auto supplies industry, wherever they are located across the country, the fact is that it is a consequence of what is happening in private credit markets. We are acting to stabilise those private credit markets, because they in turn affect the ability of consumers to buy and to access finance. On that particular note, I would draw the House's attention to a further measure taken by the government to assist with the motor vehicle financing industry - problems brought about by the withdrawal of up to 40 per cent from the market as a consequence of the withdrawal back to the United States of various auto finance firms. Again those opposite would argue, by their interjections: do nothing about the withdrawal of those historical participants in the auto finance industry. This government is prepared to have a go, to step up to the plate and to try, to the extent possible, to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of private participants within that sector of the finance industry. That measure, plus a $6.1 billion new car plan to provide certainty out to 2020 and, on top of that, the underpinning measures contained in the Nation Building and Jobs Plan in its various stages since the end of last year: that is what we have done. Each step of the way, without virtual exception, we have been attacked by those opposite.I note the look of glee on the face of the new Manager of Opposition Business as he and so many of his colleagues seem to take great political delight in the challenge of unemployment which now descends on the Australian economy as a consequence of the global economic crisis. We are putting forward solutions. You are simply contenting yourselves with politically opportunistic criticism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question. I know that she is deeply concerned about training and skilling in her electorate and in the nation generally. As the Prime Minister has been making clear to the House, the government's Economic Security Strategy and the Nation Building and Jobs Plan are about supporting jobs in this country. With those additional supports for jobs in this country, the government also recognises that, as a result of the global financial crisis and global recession bearing down on our economy, there will be and there have been jobs lost by Australians. The government has therefore taken a series of practical measures to assist those workers.Last week I announced a new measure to support apprentices who find themselves out of trade. The Prime Minister and I had the opportunity to meet some young apprentices this morning. If you meet those young apprentices and you imagine a circumstance where they are one or two years into their training and find themselves without a job through no fault of their own, then obviously you would want to extend assistance to them so that they are able to secure a new opportunity in order to complete their apprenticeship. That is what our package that I announced last week is about. It devotes around $150 million of new resources to create new incentives to give those apprentices an opportunity.In addition, as the Prime Minister has outlined to the House, we announced today some new measures for redundant workers to access employment services. We have also announced - and it is my pleasure to give the details to the House - 10,000 new productivity places for redundant workers. These training places build on what is already a very successful program, and they bring the total of available productivity places to 711,000. These places are there to enable people to access training in areas where skills have been short. For those workers who do find themselves redundant, we believe that the employment services measures and access to training places - with the 10,000 new places announced today - will make a practical difference and that is what we seek to do. Clearly, with the global financial crisis and global recession bearing down on this nation, the government is taking decisive action to cushion our economy from its full effects. The measures announced today are part of that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. We have had a demonstration in this House today of how little the opposition understand about the state of the economy and how little they have to offer in terms of an alternative to cushion the Australian economy in the circumstances of a global recession.Last October we put forward the Economic Security Strategy to support up to 75,000 jobs. We put it forward for a very good reason. And a few weeks ago we put in place the Nation Building and Jobs Plan to support up to 90,000 jobs over two years. This is a very important point that those opposite just do not seem to understand, so we are going to go through it very clearly. They have not done their homework, they do not understand the nature of the challenge, and the consequence is that they do not have a positive alternative for Australia. The other consequence is that they are now opposing a stimulus to the economy, which will support jobs for Australian workers, without putting up any alternative whatsoever. This package will support jobs for Australian workers.The opposition somehow think that if we provide a tax bonus or if we provide support to a pensioner or a carer it has nothing to do with job creation. I would have thought it was Economics 101 that if we stimulate demand in the economy and that results in people having employment along the supply chain, as the Prime Minister was saying before - in stores, in service industries, in cafes, in the transport sector or even in the ports - then that is important. But the opposition do not think it is important. The great party of business, as they proclaim themselves to be, will not support any measures which support business. They will not support any of them. So what we get in the House is point-scoring. We get nothing but point-scoring because there is no positive alternative.The two packages that we have put together - the Economic Security Strategy and the Nation Building and Jobs Plan - have been modelled by the Treasury, and those estimates are there. - I will take the opposition through the facts - the facts they try to distort, the facts they will not listen to and the facts they will not acknowledge. Fact No. 1: the Economic Security Strategy of last October was estimated to lift growth by between one-half of one per cent and one per cent and support up to 75,000 jobs. - Fact No. 2: the Nation Building and Jobs Plan was estimated to lift growth by around one-half of one per cent in 2008-09 and by three-quarters of one per cent to one per cent in 2009-10 and to support up to 90,000 jobs. They are the facts; they are laid out for everybody to see. They are acknowledged by the business community. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and ACCI all acknowledge this - but not the federal opposition. They are so far out of touch that they do not understand the importance of the fiscal stimulus or the investments that we will make on a temporary basis to support employment in the Australian economy. I will tell you why. It is because the Leader of the Opposition does not walk in the same shopping aisles as the average Australian. - I was making the point that the Liberal and National parties in this House are simply out of touch with the everyday lives of average Australians. The shadow Treasurer said only last week that Australians have never been richer. That is what he said only last week. Despite the fact that the stock market has halved in value in recent times, his view is that the champagne is still flowing. Of course, when you have the opposition led by a merchant banker and lawyer for merchant bankers, it is no wonder that they are so far out of touch.This government is dedicated to supporting jobs and cushioning the Australian economy from the impact of the global recession, and we will do everything in our power to achieve that. It would be so much better for the nation if there was some agreement from the opposition in this House on this critical national interest question. The public is crying out for some unity on this question. We have the support of the business community. We have the backing of the IMF. We have the support of most market economists. Why don't we get the support of the Liberal and National parties in this House? It is because they want to play a bit of point-scoring politics -  - So this government will not be diverted by the opposition from doing everything within its power to support jobs for Australians. We understand how important jobs are in this environment and those opposite do not. Only the Liberal Party could make the former 'Minister for Job Insecurity' their Treasury spokesman. Only the Liberal Party could do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question and his ongoing interest in jobseekers in his Queensland electorate. Today the government has taken further decisive action to assist those Australians who will be unlucky enough to find themselves out of work as a result of the global financial crisis. I have to say that it is very unfortunate to hear those opposite relishing the fact that we may have Australians losing their jobs in the near future.The government has announced a package of measures worth $300 million that will help newly redundant workers to get back into the workforce as soon as possible and indeed to improve their skills. In addition to the extra 10,000 places under the Productivity Places Program outlined by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister earlier, today I can inform the House that all newly redundant workers will be eligible for the intensive and personalised employment services. I will quote Toby Hall from Mission Australia. In response to the initiative today he said:These changes are very welcome. ...                    _                   _                   _I'm confident that these changes will deliver quick and positive results on the ground, ...Mr Hall from Mission Australia is correct: we know that rapidly connecting people with employment services will make a big difference in terms of the opportunities people have to find work. Current arrangements under the Job Network provide help with a jobseeker's resume and only one contact within the first three months, but from today all workers who are made redundant will be eligible to access intensive and personalised employment services. These services include: a comprehensive skills assessment, a referral to training in areas of skills need for those retrenched workers, a personal plan to employment, and indeed $550 for each jobseeker for goods and services to be spent on improving their opportunities to find employment.These initiatives are also consistent with the employment reforms the government made to take effect from July 1. Further, although the Job Network has four months to go - that is, before the contracts that were entered into by the previous government with employment providers expire - I have brought forward other changes to assist redundant workers. From today, new rules will apply to the jobseeker account to provide broader and more effective support.The Rudd government recognises that many Australians, as the Prime Minister has said, through no fault of their own, will find themselves out of work in the weeks and months ahead. Unlike those opposite, we will not leave them behind. We will support them through better resources and extra opportunities to retrain and upskill. While the global financial crisis is of course not within the control of any government or any nation, we are acting decisively and we are acting early to make sure that retrenched workers have every possible chance to find work in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Shortland for her question. Over the next six years, we will be investing some $3.2 billion in upgrading and building rail infrastructure. This is record investment that will create and sustain more than 1,400 direct jobs. Our investment, over half the period, is more than double what those opposite spent in this area of infrastructure.In December we announced $1.2 billion for the Australian Rail Track Corporation, rolling out an additional 17 rail projects right across the country to enhance freight movement and to create local jobs. Work has commenced already, and already hundreds of jobs have been created. The nation-building package will result in not just direct jobs in terms of on the site of where the railway works are taking place but also indirect jobs. It will result in 2.2 million new concrete sleepers, locally manufactured and installed, with 65 jobs in Wagga, which those opposite are opposed to; 60 in Mittagong that they are opposed to; 60 in Grafton that they are opposed to; and 50 at Geelong that they are opposed to. Those on that side of the House take comfort in unemployment. On this side of the House, we are investing in infrastructure and jobs. Our largest investment is $1 billion -  - I am talking about direct job creation as a result of economic stimulus and as a result of this government's activity. Our largest investment is $1 billion in the Hunter, creating 650 jobs in the Hunter region. And work is taking place right now in Maitland and in Muswellbrook. But it is not just in the Hunter - it is also in Wodonga where I went and turned a sod with the Victorian Premier for a bridge that is being built for Albury and Wodonga on the Wodonga to Seymour duplication line.But the fact is that all of these programs have been opposed by those opposite. Each and every one of the government's initiatives has been opposed by those opposite. Those on this side of the House are not prepared to just sit back and watch the impact of the global financial crisis. We are getting out there with direct investment in infrastructure - which is creating these jobs in local communities.</DOC>

 - The key point here is that the member for Paterson asked me a question relating to a determination by the independent Defence Force review tribunal, and the implementation of that decision by the Department of Defence -  - When the impact of the implementation of that decision on the special forces soldiers came to my attention, I immediately directed Defence to suspend any recovery action. I was advised, as late as about five to two this afternoon, that that suspension remains in place. I told the House last year that I would fix this problem. In addition to directing Defence to suspend the recovery payments, I have also directed them to fix the problem. I have been frustrated that Defence has been so slow to fix the problem, but on 18 February the Chief of Army, who has intervened in this issue at my request, issued a directive which will suspend the operation of the tribunal's determination both retrospectively and prospectively. I reaffirm my commitment to this House that no -  - I repeat that I directed that any recovery action be suspended. That suspension remains in place. I repeat my guarantee to this House and to all special forces soldiers who may have been -  - I repeat to all those who may have been caught up in this incident that I remain committed, and in fact I guarantee that no special forces soldier will be financially disadvantaged by the implementation of the independent Defence Force tribunal's determination of March 2008. - The member for Paterson then left the chamber.

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. I look forward to travelling to Tasmania in the next few weeks and working with her in supporting jobs in her electorate and in Tasmania more generally through the small business community there.When I was last speaking to the House about this matter I informed it of some of the endorsements of the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan. They included, from the Council of Small Business of Australia, the statement that it is 'a confidence boost for small business'. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia described the plan as a 'timely shot in the arm for small business'. We heard from the New South Wales Business Chamber, which said it was 'a shot in the arm for the New South Wales economy'. Master Builders Australia chimed in, describing it as 'a welcome boost for the building industry'. The National Farmers' Federation described it as an 'economic jumpstart'.These are glowing endorsements, but I can advise the House of further correspondence that has been received by the government, including from the Combined Small Business Alliance of Western Australia - not known for its strong affinity with the Australian Labor Party. In a letter to the Prime Minister, copied to me and to the Treasurer, it says:Dear Prime Minister,With reference to the $42 billion economic stimulus measures ... in particular the small business and general tax breaks, you and your government are to be commended for your initiative in your endeavour to address the nation's dire economic circumstances. We appreciate and support your government's consideration for the small business sector and, whilst we fully understand that these initiatives are not a 'silver bullet', we believe they will make a contribution to alleviating the plight of small business in these difficult times.The Pharmacy Guild of Australia indicated that it welcomes the tax break for small business and - importantly, in the face of other comments that we receive - says:The measure comes at the right time to encourage community pharmacies to make productive investments ...Indeed, they join with Restaurant &amp; Catering Australia, who said:The small business tax break _ may just be what our small businesses need to convince them to buy that new piece of equipment in this market.It seems that just about everyone in Australia supports the small business tax break and the Nation Building and Jobs Plan except the coalition. The Leader of the Opposition, on 12 February, said in the parliament:It should be obvious to the government, had it any experience with small business, or business at all, that in times like this there will be small businesses particularly which will not have the need or even the cash flow to purchase new equipment.That flies directly in the face of the comments of Restaurant &amp; Catering Australia, who welcomed it as a boost for investment, and comments from the Western Australian business chamber and other organisations.I advise the House that the Treasurer's and my office are getting a large number of inquiries from small businesses seeking information on how to take advantage of the investment tax break. Also, Treasury has set up an email address to respond to small business inquiries. It is: investmentallowance@treasury.gov.au. I am further advised that last week Treasury was getting around 30 to 40 inquiries per day and the tax office was getting around 20 to 30 inquiries per day. So much for the coalition's criticism that small business will not be able to take advantage of this tax break, when we are getting so many inquiries from small businesses that are very keen to do just that.The Nation Building and Jobs Plan supports small businesses. It supports independent contractors. The problem is that the only jobs the coalition members support are their own. I am advised that there was another brawl in the party room today between supporters of the member for Higgins and supporters of the Leader of the Opposition - a very vigorous debate. The trouble is - otherwise it would not be so important, Mr Speaker - the voting pattern of the coalition in the Senate is being determined by the animosities of members of the coalition, leading to very poor decision making -  - The point I am making is that the decisions of the coalition in terms of their voting behaviour in the Senate are being driven by the ambitions, animosity and avarice of coalition members, and that is not in the national interest. They are behaving in their own personal self-interest, and while they behave in their own personal self-interest the Rudd government will continue to govern in the national interest.An opposition member - Why?</DOC>

 - The reality is that Defence cannot give me those numbers -  -  - so farcical -  The member for Mackellar then left the chamber. 
 - so farcical is the state of the systems we have inherited. This is a question - The member for Curtin then left the chamber. -  - Those issues go to a range of problems, including ICT problems and the inflexibility and lack of capacity of those systems and, of course, the informal process which was granting special forces soldiers competencies without a formal course. That is just a fact. I reaffirm my commitment to ensure that nobody wrapped up in the processes of the implementation of the defence force review tribunal's determination will be adversely affected by this series of events.I should say this: the opposition needs to be very careful here. There are a number of people who regularly incur overpayments and therefore debts. Some of them originally were wrapped up in the review tribunal's determinations. They are no longer affected, because I have suspended that recovery process and they will be fixed. Others have debts for other reasons, and the opposition needs to be very careful to differentiate between those two or three or four or five different sets of people. My recommendation to the opposition is to stop playing politics with our special forces soldiers.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Blair for his question. The global financial crisis has seen a downturn in the housing and construction sector, threatening the jobs of many Australians. That is why this government took early and decisive action in October last year to support jobs in housing and construction. I think it is fair to say now that the first home owner boost is having an effect, especially as it has been combined with low interest rates. In fact, the member for Blair was telling me in his own electorate, at the mobile offices that he has every weekend, that interest from first home buyers in our first home owner boost has been very strong and that the newer suburbs in his electorate - suburbs like Brassall, Raceview and Flinders View - are becoming hot destinations for potential first home buyers.First home buyers have taken up the benefit of the first home owner boost in great numbers. In fact, I have recently received the January data on the number of people who have taken up the first home owner boost. By the end of January nearly 30,000 people had taken up the first home owner boost. Indeed, 6½ thousand of those are in the member's home state of Queensland. Other figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirm these very positive signs. The ABS housing finance data for the month of December showed a 6.4 per cent increase in the number of new home loans to owner occupiers compared with the previous month. What is even more encouraging is that there was a 15.1 per cent increase in loans to purchase new dwellings, with just under a 10 per cent increase in loans to construct new dwellings - all very positive numbers. It is great news for the building and construction sector, but of course it is also great news for those young Australians whom this government is helping into the housing market.Increased activity in building and construction is not just good for the building and construction sector; it is good for the people who make all the supplies, like bricks and tiles, that go into building those new homes. It is also terrific for the retail sector. People do not move into a new home without buying a new refrigerator or new carpet or new tables and chairs. All of these jobs are very important.The comments from industry have been very supportive. One example is Nigel Satterley, the chief executive of the Satterley Property Group, a major builder in Western Australia. I can hear some Western Australians talking about the Satterley group. Nigel Satterley contacted me this week to say:Since the introduction of the first home owners grant, things have improved significantly. On Saturday I visited the southern suburbs two busiest builders display centres. They were a lot busier than they had been and it was an extremely hot day. Our land sales offices had good inquiries and we are on track to sell 200 residential lots net in Perth for the month of February. The first home buyers grant is continuing to work and assist in the Perth property market's soft recovery.Stockland are saying that about 65 per cent of their trade is now for first home buyers in residential sales, and volumes of sales are up by 25 to 30 per cent in areas like Craigieburn in Melbourne's northern growth corridor. The Housing Industry Association are saying that, if it were not for large interest rate cuts and the federal government's temporary boost to the first home owners grant, significantly slower growth rates would have been forecast for 2009-10 and 2010-11. Harley Dale from the HIA says:The First Home Owners boost, mortgage rates at a forty year low, and the housing components of the Federal Government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan have the capacity to deliver a moderate recovery in residential activity.The government has a plan to support jobs in the housing and construction sector. The first home owners boost as well as the construction of 20,000 new community and public housing dwellings will keep tradies in work, keep contractors busy and keep apprentices employed. It will also help Australians who are struggling in the private rental market. The measures are good for jobs, they are good for the economy and they are a great help to many Australians who need a roof over their heads.</DOC>

 - In reference to the honourable member's question, if he were to stand as I did, and other members have, with our forces serving in that environment and the dangers that they face, then the response - and the right response - to those brave soldiers is to say, 'We are going home to Christmas, to be with our families, and you are going to be here.' That is exactly what I said and the honourable member knows that. I would suggest that the honourable member seeking to 'render' my remarks in the way in which he has done reflects on him in a particular way. -  - As the honourable member has raised this, let me quote to the House the paragraph to which he refers. This was me in Afghanistan to the troops assembled:It doesn't make it any easier to be apart from them - that is, your family - at this time of year. I'm going to go home and spend my Christmas with my wife and three kids and you're not. And I understand that's hard.But you know, at this time of year in particular, as the families of the nation settle down around a Christmas tree and share presents, the nation will be thinking of you as well. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Earlier today there was a gathering here in Parliament House of people directly engaged in the great challenge of organ donation - those who are waiting for the donation of organs, those who are from families who have already provided organs and who know the distressed circumstances associated with that, and medical professionals who seek to support families in both circumstances as well.As honourable members in this place will know, right across Australia as we speak today 1,800 individuals are currently on organ donation waiting lists. Because of that, the nation has a responsibility to improve the current set of arrangements which have seen our donation rates not improve for many, many years. The consequence, as I am advised by those presenting material to the gathering earlier today in parliament, is that some three Australians lose their lives each day waiting for the donation of organs to occur.As a nation we can do better than this. For those reasons the government, at the end of last year, announced that we were going to invest $151.1 million over four years to reform the national organ and tissue donation system in order to save lives. There are five elements to this: first, $46 million to introduce a coordinated and consistent approach under the leadership of a new independent national authority, the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority - this is now up and running; second, $67 million to employ trained medical specialists to work closely with emergency department and intensive care unit teams in selected public and private hospitals across Australia and other staff dedicated to organ donation; third, $17 million in new funding for hospitals to meet additional staffing, bed and infrastructure costs associated with organ donation; fourth, $13 million towards raising community awareness; and, fifth, $2 million for counsellors to support donor families.Today, together with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator McLucas, I announced also the composition of the 15-member advisory council, which will be headed by businessman and double lung transplant recipient Sam Chisholm. This is a good initiative, and I thank all those who are now going to be members of this advisory council for their work. It is important that we get this done right.This is an important measure for families right across the country and, if there is one single thing which can be done this day, on the day when this council has been appointed, it is as follows: to draw home again to every family in the nation the importance of getting your organ donation records in place, to have the conversation with your family about the need for organ donation, to resolve that in advance and to make sure the records are set in order so that, if and when a tragedy arises, this current terrible shortfall in organ donation in Australia can be reduced from where it is now. So my appeal through the parliament to the nation is: let us again seize this opportunity to raise awareness across the country; let us do so through the activities of this day and week, which draw the nation's attention to this important need to lift the overall donation rate. We will be doing our bit through the nation's media, in a focused television advertising campaign, to get this as much as possible on people's personal radar screens, but at the end of the day it boils down to a family conversation. Those family conversations have to be had if we are going to make a difference.Honourable members would have seen a little girl in the media recently - and she was here with us today - named Cordelia Whatman. She is one or two years old - a tiny tot - and in the nick of time she received the procedure which she needed last year. It is wonderful to see her skipping around like a normal one- or two-year-old, and that was not really a prospect for Cordelia last year. But, you know, across the country there are 1,800 little Cordelias, and there are a number of them with us today who are still on that waiting list. So the government has acted through the parliament to establish this authority. We have provided the funding necessary to support its work, but we also need consciousness raised in each community. I would appeal to each member to do what they can in their community to lift the donation rate. It is really important to make a difference for those 1,800 Australians who, as we meet here today, are waiting for a phone call.</DOC>

 - This government is determined to do everything within its power to ensure that the members of the special forces, and the members of the Australian Defence Force in the broad, are paid and remunerated properly. Secondly, as the minister has correctly said, none of those members of the special forces would suffer any level of financial disadvantage whatsoever. Thirdly, the government therefore has absolute confidence in the minister's handling of this matter. It is being done the right way, with the Chief of Army in control. It will take time to fix, but fix it we will.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. The Rudd government is committed to a prudent and responsible course of action for addressing the challenges of the future, and that includes a significant implementation of substantial energy efficiency measures as part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Critically, that also means bringing through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to begin reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions at least cost as we address the significant challenge of climate change with a $4 billion investment in Energy Efficient Homes, a package that is already supporting jobs and that has supported jobs since the day it was announced - 3 February - and there is more to come.The opposition blocked this plan and, in doing so, they were blocking ready-to-go jobs. But, unlike the opposition, Australia's insulation and solar hot water industries were on the starting blocks ready to go. The Prime Minister has referred in question time to the CEO of the Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand, who has said:Making energy efficient homes more affordable and accessible to all Australians is vital for the prosperity of our industry and has far reaching flow-on benefits for Australia.The fact is that installation and distribution provide the biggest intensive labour application for installing insulation in the ceilings of homes. This was the package that the opposition blocked, and they continue to run it down.Energy efficiency remains a key plank in the government's overall approach to addressing climate change. It is an approach that is built around a consistent and coherent policy position. When we look to the opposition, they seem to have fractured into a coalition with about six or seven positions on one aspect of dealing with climate change, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They are contradicting one another, they are contradicting themselves. I note that the opposition leader, who started off supporting emissions trading, as recently as 15 December described the government's emission reduction targets as 'a very significant cut'. He said:I wouldn't be misled by the fact that five per cent, for example, looks like a low number.I note that some commentators have picked up on the fact that on the 23rd of this month he said that the CPRS would be 'an ineffectual scheme' because the cut in emissions is going to be very low. So he has gone from 'very significant' to 'very low' in two months.Then there is the opposition spokesman on emissions trading, the member for Goldstein. He has a famous view on climate change, given that he regards it as a communist conspiracy. Who could forget his remarks in 2006 that climate change was:_ a leftist fad that will divert resources away from other more needy areas of the economy.After the fall of communism, it [global warming] has become a cause celebre for the left.More recently, only on 19 February, the member for Goldstein was floating the idea of a carbon tax.The member for Cowan then left the chamber. - Then on Lateline he said that the opposition supports a higher target than the government whilst at the same time he was spruiking the benefits of energy efficiency. So here is the member for Goldstein: a climate change convert despite describing it as a left-wing fad, an energy efficiency convert despite lining up two weeks ago to block the largest rollout in Australia's history of energy efficiency.They talk about trajectories when they talk about greenhouse gas emissions, but the coalition has got a position which is carbon taxes, lower targets, higher targets. Of course, finally we can always rely on a timely outbreak of the foundational position of scepticism. Senator Minchin reminded us yesterday when he took the ABC to task for referring to carbon dioxide as pollution. According to Senator Minchin, it is 'grossly misleading for the ABC to describe carbon dioxide as an air pollutant'. - 'Hear, hear,' they say on the other side of the House. I need say no more in this answer. But I will go on, because at least Senator Minchin has been consistent. He was a sceptic in government and he is a sceptic in opposition, but the rest of the coalition's position on this matter is hopelessly contradictory.The government has an employment component of the Energy Efficient Homes package which will put ceiling insulation into the homes of 2.7 million households. It is undeniable that from day one it was the insulation fitter who said on ABC radio:Our own company had to lay off a shift in one of our plants just before Christmas. We'll be putting that shift back on.The Rudd government delivers in supporting Australian jobs. That is exactly what the Energy Efficient Homes package is already delivering.</DOC>

 - When it comes to the announcement today by Pacific Brands, the response from all members of this House should be one of extreme disappointment at the decision. Furthermore, reflecting on the fact that this is devastating and distressing news for the workers concerned, we understand from advice to the government that full entitlements will be paid. Under the TCF Structural Adjustment Program, affected workers will be immediately eligible for intensive support and customised assistance. Pacific Brands' decision is bad news for the TCF sector and it is bad news for the economy. I understand that the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research had been informed by the Chairman of Pacific Brands that there was nothing the government could do to reverse the decision by the company. That was the position put to the government by the Chairman of Pacific Brands, I am advised.The key challenge that we face in dealing with the impact of the global economic recession on Australian manufacturing and across the broad economy is ensuring that what we do through nation building, investment in schools and investment in support of consumers and families doing it tough is lift overall demand in this economy at a time when the private sector is in retreat. That is what underpins the government's nation-building plan for the future. As the government has said repeatedly, there are no silver bullets in this. However, the challenge is this: either to reduce the impact of the global economic recession on Australia or to simply do nothing. Our strategy as a government is outlined in our nation-building plan for the future, an economic strategy to see Australia through the crisis. The alternative recommended by those opposite is to sit on our hands and do nothing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. I know right now she is extremely concerned and is providing considerable support to her communities back home as they face these terrible bushfires. We are all aware that many small businesses and farms are the backbone of all of these communities that have been affected by the fires. So many of these businesses have been destroyed, so there are now many families with mortgages to pay that no longer have jobs. So, as well as the disaster payments, the government is providing additional financial assistance to support people who have lost their livelihoods. The Income Recovery Subsidy provides payments equivalent to the maximum rate of Newstart over 13 weeks. So far, payments totalling more than $641,000 have been made to 1,660 people.I will share a story about just one of those people with the House. One of them is a tradesman who lost his work ute and all of his tools in the fire. He contacted Centrelink. He was understandably very distressed. He did not know how he was going to get his business up and running again. The Centrelink officer told him that he was eligible for the Income Recovery Subsidy and probably the disaster payment as well. The Centrelink officer put him in touch with Red Cross. The next day when he called back his subsidy payment was in his account, along with the disaster payment. The Red Cross had connected him with someone who was helping him replace his tools and his ute. He was very appreciative of the support of the Centrelink staff.The Income Recovery Subsidy also extends to those who are not at their usual jobs. These people might be out lending a hand in fighting the fires or they might be helping people who are trying to recover from the fires. The Income Recovery Subsidy can also be paid to them.I would also like to inform the House that today I approved the extension of the Income Recovery Subsidy to people in north-western Queensland, who have been struggling in the face of the floods caused by Tropical Cyclone Charlotte. These are important measures that the government is putting in place to make sure that people who are trying to get back on their feet and trying to get their businesses up and running can do so with the maximum level of support.</DOC>

 - It is certainly a sad day when we see so many job losses. There is no doubt about that. The reason the government are so emphatic about our Economic Security Strategy, delivered last October, and our Nation Building and Jobs Plan is precisely to support jobs in the Australian community. One can only imagine how much worse it might be if we had not acted last October. -  - It is almost as if you can hear the glee in their voices, so they can score a cheap political point about such a serious matter. It is the case that the Economic Security Strategy will support 75,000 jobs and what we know is how much worse our situation would be if those opposite were currently on this side of the House. The Economic Security Strategy -  -  - Mr Speaker, this is a very serious matter. The Economic Security Strategy that we brought down last October was estimated to lift growth by between one-half of one per cent and one per cent and to support up to 75,000 jobs. That is the modelling from the Treasury. Our Nation Building and Jobs Plan is estimated to lift growth by around half a per cent in 2008-09 and by between three-quarters of one per cent and one per cent in 2009-10. We have to think about it like this: we are in the middle of a global recession. We have seen the sharpest contraction in the global economy in our lifetimes, and that is delivering a very significant shock to the Australian economy and a substantial reduction in demand. It is causing higher unemployment. We pointed directly to this in February when we delivered our Nation Building and Jobs Plan, because we said that our No. 1 priority was to support employment in the Australian community.Who opposed that plan? All those over there opposed that plan. Effectively, when they came into this House and voted against the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, they voted for higher unemployment. Their approach is to sit on their hands and do nothing. Let us just take our Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which will support the employment of up to 90,000 people. If the Leader of the Opposition were the leader on this side of the House, there would be 90,000 more people unemployed in Australia. That is the truth of it, because these plans are designed to support employment in the Australian community precisely at a time when the global recession is imposing a very sharp contraction on this economy. This government are determined to act, and act we have. We have acted with some force and we have acted with power - when those on the other side of the House have simply sat on their hands and scored cheap political points. They should be condemned for that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. I note her deep concern in relation to this matter. Could I start by expressing my condolences to all the people affected by this terrible tragedy - a tragedy that has shocked and saddened our nation. As part of the emergency procedures during the Victorian bushfires, eight nursing homes and hostels, with more than 300 residents, were evacuated. I take this opportunity to commend the staff and volunteers who assisted with these evacuations. In response to the devastating bushfires in Victoria, the Australian government has undertaken many practical measures to help older people affected by the bushfires.Today I have advised the Victorian Minister for Community Services, Lisa Neville, that the federal government is providing up to $500,000 for extra home and community care services for older people in the bushfire affected areas. This means they can get help in their homes and with services such as Meals on Wheels, personal care or community transport. In total, we are providing up to $1.5 million to cover the costs of emergency nursing home care and of replacing necessary items burnt in the bushfires - such as motorised wheelchairs and walking frames - and personal care items lost by older Australians in the bushfires.In addition, we have also removed the requirement for aged-care assessments for older people affected by the fires. This is a one-off measure that has fast-tracked aged care for older Victorians needing emergency respite care. This means cutting through the red tape to get nursing home places for them immediately. So far, 18 older Australians from the bushfire areas have been provided with respite care in nursing homes. They can stay in the nursing homes until they are able to make longer term arrangements for their accommodation, or they may decide to remain in the nursing home on a permanent basis. This is about providing practical help to those older Australians who have suffered and lost so much in these tragic bushfires.</DOC>

 - The challenges presented to the Australian economy and to workers and their families by the global economic recession are reaching right across our country. Our responsibility as a government, through the parliament, is to engage in proper investment in infrastructure and support for families, which reduce the impact on the economy and jobs overall. That is why the government has done what it has done. We do not apologise for it. It is the right course of action to have embarked upon, first of all, support for families, pensioners and first home buyers in the approach that we took at the end of last year.I would say to the Leader of the National Party, who asked the question: did you vote for that package at the end of last year? I thought the Leader of the National Party, following the lead from the Leader of the Liberal Party last year on the question of the Economic Security Strategy, which contained $4.8 billion worth of payments to pensioners and, on top of that, some $1.2 billion in allocations to first home buyers, supported the package. My recollection is that the Nationals stated their support for it - that is, the package last year. I understand further that they then voted for it. But then they engaged in what is called the Liberal Party three-step: firstly, support it; secondly, seek to undermine it; and, thirdly, oppose it when the political opportunity presents itself. That is actually called the Liberal Party three-step, which is now the National Party three-step. That is what they said last year, and now they seek to distance themselves from the fact that they voted for that package last year. I simply make that a point of record in this place.This year the government's nation building plan, as we know, was voted down on three occasions by those opposite and their counterparts in the Senate. The government succeeded in obtaining the passage of that plan through the parliament. The whole objective is this: through this investment in infrastructure and support for families, to reduce the impact of the global economic recession on Australian workers and families. The difference is very plain in this place. What we have is a Liberal Party and a National Party who are seeking to take political advantage of the global economic recession. We have, of course, the Leader of the Liberal National Party in Queensland saying that the global economic recession is 'peripheral' to the state of Queensland. I find that remarkable. Look at the impact on Queensland revenues of the collapse that is occurring in mining exports around the world. Royalty revenues, including coal revenues, will fall by around $1.5 billion - from $3.5 billion in 2008-09 to around $2 billion in 2009-10 - and there will be other impacts on the revenue as well. And the Leader of the Liberal National Party in Queensland says that this impact on budget caused by the global economic recession is peripheral! I assume that the Liberal and National parties in this place agree with him. Is that correct? - For the benefit of the honourable member, a number of those jobs have been lost in Queensland as well. The point I make to the honourable member is that the global economic crisis is directly impacting on Queensland and every state in the country, and for anyone leading the Liberal National Party to say that that effect on local jobs in Queensland is peripheral shows how out of touch the Liberal National Party has become.What is the difference here? You have a government embarked on an economic strategy to see Australia through this global economic crisis, and you have the Liberal and National parties embarked on a political strategy to take political advantage of the global crisis. That is the difference. We stand by our strategy; you continue to prosecute yours.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question because it reminds us of the global economic forces which are at work in Australia and across the various states of Australia as well. Before the Leader of the National Party interjects, I again draw his attention to something he has not yet responded to: do you support the remarks by Mr Springborg that the global financial crisis is peripheral to the state economy of Queensland? Do you support that? For the record, the Leader of the National Party and the Leader of the Liberal Party in this House are silent and refuse to endorse the remarks by the Leader of the Liberal National Party in Queensland.When it comes to the ingredients of the global economic crisis, there has been further data released in the last 24 hours of which honourable members should be apprised. US stocks fell this week to their lowest level since 1996. This has erased 12 years of stock market gains. Furthermore, if you look at the US confidence indicators, the US Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since data began in 1967. Of course, economic data continues to unfold from Europe as well. Industrial orders in the Euro area fell 5.2 per cent from November and 22 per cent on the year earlier. German business confidence fell dramatically in figures released overnight. The IFO Institute, in Munich, said its business survey had fallen to 82.6, from 83 in January, making for the worst reading since 1982.These clear pieces of global economic data from the No. 1 economy in the world and the No. 3 economy in the world are of direct relevance to what happens in this economy as well. They are of direct relevance also to what happens in the Queensland economy. Therefore, the challenge facing the House is the strategy which we are prepared to embark upon in this country to reduce the impact of these global economic forces. Our response in this country is clear: when it comes to fiscal stimulus, that which we have announced, against that which has been embraced in other countries, is in fact relatively small. Look, for example, at the United States and President Obama's fiscal stimulus package of 6.9 per cent of GDP, or $787 billion. I quote Fed chairman Bernanke, who said:To break the adverse feedback loop, it is essential that we continue to complement fiscal stimulus with strong government action to stabilise financial institutions and financial markets.A combination of fiscal stimulus through budget action on the one hand and continued action to stabilise financial markets on the other is the way all governments around the world at present are seeking to deal with this problem, which has been visited upon our shores as well. What we know for sure is this: more jobs will be lost in Australia if no action is taken by government to support growth and to support jobs in the economy. That is an absolute, clear-cut fact. There again I return to the clear contrast between the two of us, government and opposition. You either have an economic strategy, as the government does, to see Australia through this global economic crisis - that is our approach - or the alternative, from the Liberal and National parties, which is a political strategy to seek to take political advantage of this global crisis. It is almost as if each time job losses are announced in this country you can hear the champagne corks pop in the Liberal and National parties' party room.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. One of the great privileges enjoyed by any Minister for Defence is the opportunity to move amongst, to speak with and to mix with the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I can tell the House that I exercise that privilege on a regular basis. One group I regularly move amongst is those who serve in our SAS - those who regularly put their lives on the line for our country. I see them at their bases; and, by the way, I visited Campbell Barracks just five days after this issue was first revealed last year to check on members of the regiment and to secure feedback from them. I also see them on exercises. I eat with them. I even have a beer with them.No-one knows them better than I and no-one has a higher appreciation of what they do for their country. As minister, I will not allow them to be disadvantaged. When I first learned of the implications of the tribunal's decision in October last year during Senate estimates I took immediate action. I directed the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Army to put an immediate stop on any recovery action - a recovery action which was immediately implemented and has remained in place up until this day. I also instructed them to immediately do whatever it takes to correct this problem. I said earlier in the week that that solution came much more slowly than I would have liked. What we did need, of course, was a solution that was legally robust - one which was permanent and did not, in its rush, simply create more problems for those affected. -  - This question was thoroughly examined during Senate estimates this morning, and I welcome that examination. I am pleased that senior people in uniform, including the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Army, were able to give what I thought were very adequate answers and a fuller explanation - they had more time than I have here to explain the situation. Additionally I am pleased that Senator Johnston - to his credit I should say - has now acknowledged that the situation is being progressed in a positive way. I will quote Senator Johnston from Senate estimates when he said: 'Now, can I thank you, General' - that is Lieutenant General Gillespie - 'for the way you've answered my questions today. I am satisfied that things are moving ahead positively. I have what I need for my satisfaction that these men will be looked after properly.' I guaranteed those affected that they would not be financially disadvantaged. They will not be. They are not. The problem has been solved.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. I know that working families in Flynn are feeling the full heat of this global recession. It is impacting in his community, and I acknowledge the very strong representations that he is making on behalf of working families in the electorate of Flynn. Australia is battling a global recession, and it is felt particularly savagely in a community like Gladstone and the wider area of Central Queensland. The impacts are there and they are immediate. What do they flow from? They flow directly from a global recession.We can see what has occurred in the United States, which has shed something like half a million jobs per month in the past three months. Job losses of this magnitude are unprecedented in the 70-year history of the data series in the United States. We have seen a rapid deterioration around the world. Not only did the US economy contract by one per cent in the December quarter - its worst performance since 1982 - the Euro and UK economies contracted by 1.5 per cent, the sharpest quarterly contractions in that area since the early 1980s, and Japan contracted by a staggering three per cent in the December quarter, the largest contraction since 1974. Also, in recent days, we have seen contractions in Taiwan and Thailand, 6.1 per cent; Korea, 5.6 per cent; and Singapore, 4.5 per cent. And it is likely that growth in China, which has been the powerhouse of the global economy in recent years, could grind to a halt in the December quarter.That is sobering news for this country, because it describes the sharpest synchronised downturn in the global economy in our lifetimes. At the moment, something like seven of our top 10 major trading partners are already in recession. Of course, this has very serious impacts on our economy. It will wipe around $60 billion from the value of our exports this year alone. It will mean that jobs are lost in the Australian economy - such as we have seen today with Pacific Brands. We on this side of the House understand how serious the global recession is and how important it is to act and to support economic growth and jobs. The IMF and most respected economists the world over have the view that it is important that governments take decisive action to stimulate the economy - and, of course, that is precisely what we have done.In the middle of all of this global carnage, it simply beggars belief that anybody could underestimate the size, nature and power of this challenge, but it is far worse when it comes from people who should know better and are supposed to exercise economic leadership in this place - and, of course, that is the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition said last year that the global financial crisis, which has turned into a global recession, was 'overhyped'. The shadow Treasurer said it was all manufactured, and I quote: 'They are trying to manufacture, you know, a crisis' - as if all of these events were not happening then and have not accelerated in recent times. Anybody who was watching Senate estimates today could see how the Liberal and National parties do not understand the nature of the challenge that we face. They simply do not understand it.Of course, there is someone else who comes from the school of economics that those opposite come from, which says, 'Do nothing; let people go to the wall; just make a political point.' As the Prime Minister said before, the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Springborg, said that the global financial crisis and recession is 'only peripheral to what is happening in Queensland'. I tell you what: it is not peripheral in Gladstone. The member for Flynn knows that. It is not peripheral right up the Queensland coast. It is not peripheral in the great mining towns of Queensland. And it is not peripheral in the urban centres of Queensland. The transmission channel of this global recession goes straight to the traded goods sector and straight into those parts of the country that have been participating in the mining boom, which has now unwound. It has unwound and we are now living with the consequences.What is it with these people - the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland? They are three peas in a pod all living in a fantasy world of economic denial. These are serious times, and my message to the shadow Treasurer is pretty simple: do your homework; do some hard work; come up with some alternative policy; put up some positive alternative; and give up the pointscoring. The unemployed of this country deserve far better.The member for Kalgoorlie then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I am not aware of the particular case, although I have noticed that Senate Johnston has been bandying around a piece of paper - unwilling, by the way, to share it with me. So I invite the member to table it, so that I can, if possible -  -  - I know that the names in the document have been blanked out - and I know that from Senate estimates - so there is not a privacy issue. It would be helpful, because, as I said, last October I immediately directed the CDF and the Chief of Army to put an immediate stop on any recovery action - a stop that has been in place up until this time. It could be that recovery for some other reason was taking place. If the opposition want to share the information with me, I will be happy to assist in any way that I can. Defence recovers debts for various reasons, and I am advised that, given the stop, this is not likely to be a case where someone has been affected by the implementation of the DFRT's decision.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know that she is deeply concerned about this issue and, like me and other members in this parliament, she would have been very, very disappointed to hear today the news from Pacific Brands and to see that 1,850 workers around the country, through no fault of their own, are losing their jobs.What we can do, faced with the global financial crisis and global recession bearing down on our economy, is take decisive action to do three things. Firstly, we can stabilise financial markets - action that the government have taken. Secondly, we can act to stimulate the economy, which is what the government did through our Economic Security Strategy, through our Nation Building and Jobs Plan and through our investment in infrastructure, including our investments in local infrastructure through local governments. As part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, we have made a historic and unprecedented investment in schools right around the country in order to bring those schools into the 21st century and to provide the standards that Australians want for their children when they are being educated. At the same time we have taken the opportunity to support jobs right around the nation in the communities in which those schools are located.The third thing government can do is give a helping hand to those who find themselves redundant in these difficult days, as the global financial crisis and the global recession bear down on the Australian economy. The government have announced in recent days a number of practical measures that we believe will make a difference for some Australians in these circumstances. Most particularly, we announced new incentive payments. For those apprentices who find themselves without a job, having part way completed their apprenticeship, there are new incentive payments to assist them to get an opportunity with a new employer or a group training organisation in order to complete their apprenticeship. There are also new resources available to registered training organisations to help out-of-trade apprentices complete their apprenticeships. Then yesterday, with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment Participation, we announced new investments in giving a helping hand to Australians who are made redundant, including a nearly $300 million investment in personalised and intensive assistance for those Australians who are made redundant, and an investment in 10,000 new training places for redundant workers. This brings to a total of 711,000 the productivity places available to help people skill and reskill. They can find opportunities in those parts of the economy that still need skilled labour and, when the economy moves into growth, we will not see the same cycle that we have seen in the past where, in economic downturn, skilling and training slows and then, when the economy grows, the lack of skilled labour itself becomes a capacity constraint and prevents the economy growing as quickly as it otherwise could.For the individuals involved, most particularly the 1,850 workers who heard this difficult news today about Pacific Brands, we understand that they would be feeling hurt and distressed. Obviously, we will be there with the personalised and intensive assistance to work with them. We have been very clear that there will be other days on which we hear this kind of distressing news - the news that we heard today - as the global financial crisis and global recession bear down on our economy. But the government will continue to take decisive action as necessary to support those individuals and to cushion our economy against the full effects of the global financial crisis and global recession.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Not surprisingly, the issue of special forces pay was the key topic in Senate estimates this morning. The member asks a very detailed question - the same question that was asked by Senator Johnston of senior military leaders at great length this morning. Senior military leaders, including the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Army, answered those questions, including in great detail -  -  - I share with the House the words of Senator Johnston following those answers. - Given that those opposite were obviously not listening very well earlier on, I will repeat Senator Johnston's quote -  -  - After extensive grilling in Senate estimates, Senator Johnston said: 'Now, can I thank you, General' - that is General Gillespie, Chief of Army - 'for the way you've answered my questions today.' - Senator Johnston said: 'Now, can I thank you, General, for the way that you've answered my questions today. I am satisfied that things are moving ahead positively. I have what I need for the - for my satisfaction - ' - Senator Johnston said: 'I am satisfied that things are moving ahead positively. I have what I need for the - for my satisfaction that these men will be looked after properly.' - The shadow minister responsible has publicly said, in estimates, that he is satisfied with the progress of this issue, having grilled senior military people on this issue. They say the buck stops with me, and it certainly does, and it does with every minister in my position. Indeed, I was advised by Army today that the government has found itself in this situation in the past. I am advised that in 2006 Defence worked to resolve a longstanding issue that resulted from a Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal determination - very familiar - where 5,500 then-serving soldiers and up to 20,000 ex-soldiers had potentially been overpaid. I am advised the issue was a potential overpayment for trade pay -  -  - You just don't get it, do you? - I am advised the issue was the potential overpayment for trade pay, as soldiers had not completed the required training. - I have done three things: an immediate stop on the recovery process, a Chief of Army directive, which has now -  -  - 18 February, which has now extinguished all debts. No member of the ADF now has a debt as a result of the implementation of the rem tribunal's decision. There is one other thing I have done. I have ensured that this will not happen in the future by making sure that all qualifications in the future are granted formally and by ensuring that we make the appropriate investment in our ICT systems. If the former government had done that back in 2006, we would not be having this debate today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question and for his ongoing interest in looking after job seekers and those workers who might find themselves redundant in the months ahead. Mr Speaker, as you know, being made redundant is one of the worst experiences that can confront any worker. I remember when my father was made redundant. I remember when, as I became a new member of parliament, thousands of workers in my electorate were made redundant as a result of the collapse of Ansett. I do recall those days in 2001, dealing with thousands of workers who did not have sufficient assistance to find their way back into the workforce. But can I say that, through a $300 million package announced yesterday, the government has acted to provide ordinary Australian workers with access to additional support and training to gain skills and to regain employment as quickly as possible.In stark contrast with those opposite, who seem to have no idea how to tackle the global financial crisis and no idea how to attend to the needs of job seekers in this country, the Rudd government is working in partnership with business groups, unions, church and welfare organisations and, of course, employment service providers to develop this significant package of support and training measures to assist newly redundant workers. We have put together a package of the best ideas and put them into action quickly to support newly redundant workers and we will deliver this package through collaboration with industry.I do not know who the opposition are talking to these days, but can I say that the business groups have come out and warmly welcomed the announcement made yesterday by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and me. The Business Council of Australia, through its CEO, Katie Lahey, yesterday welcomed the announcement of immediate assistance for workers. Ms Lahey said:We need to limit the effect of the downturn on individuals and the economy in order to position Australia more strongly for recovery. Measures to reduce the time an employee spends out of the workforce will be vital in achieving this.ACCI responded to the initiative in the following way:The announcement will help the newly unemployed bounce back into the job market.Better matching newly retrenched workers with available jobs will also help the business community retain workforce skills and add to economic efficiency.The third employer body that responded yesterday was the Ai Group, which indicated:There is no doubt that pressures are growing on employment and the additional investment in employment services is 'spot on'.The Ai Group said that these initiatives are spot on and that they are sensible and very necessary in the current uncertain economic climate. These initiatives have been widely welcomed by employer groups, the ACTU, community groups, churches, employment providers and others because this package is intervening early to assist job seekers - to assist those people in this country who are made redundant through no fault of their own. We know that quickly connecting people with employment services and referring them to training in areas of skill need will provide better opportunities for these workers to find work in the near future. It will help newly redundant workers get back into the workforce to maintain and boost their skills, and indeed this is critical. That is why the government has acted decisively in relation to this matter. We continue to make decisions in the national interest, in the interests of business and in the interests of Australian workers and their families.</DOC>

I referred to an earlier incident when they were in government. - On that occasion the amount of money the government of the day was seeking to recover was $9 million. Indeed, that $9 million was booked -  - I will, Mr Speaker.

He speaks of the need for hope and confidence and about the strength of this economy, when in recent days he has appointed a shadow Treasurer who said a year ago, and has championed this since: 'I firmly believe we are heading into a recession nationally.' So there we have, on the one hand, the shadow treasurer in the last 24 hours speaking about the need for hope and positive sentiment in the economy, reflected again in the question just asked by the Leader of the Opposition, when the same shadow Treasurer has chanted this mantra for the year, beginning with February last year: 'I firmly believe we are heading into a recession.'

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We all know that the efficient and speedy settling of insurance claims will play a very important part as people seek to rebuild their homes and their lives following the Victorian bushfires. The latest advice is that 6,760 bushfire related insurance claims have been received. Approximately 85 per cent of these relate to property or contents. The approximate value of claims received to date, including residential, commercial, industrial and farming losses, is $810 million. This number is, of course, subject to refinement as further assessment and further work is done to detail the affected premises and assets.The $810 million estimate comprises approximately 76 per cent domestic claims and 24 per cent farming, commercial and insurance claims. To 23 February, the general insurance industry has delivered approximately $63 million in emergency payment cash settlements to affected policyholders. Several insurers have now completed 100 per cent of the assessment of their commercial claims, while others have completed more than 80 per cent. The remainder of the claims are in areas which cannot currently be accessed. Sixty per cent of home claims have had their sites assessed, up from 50 per cent last Sunday. Of course, progress in completing assessments is dependent on the policyholder being ready to progress the claim - some, understandably, are not - and also on police and coronial activity in the area and, in some cases, continuing bushfires.When I last addressed the House on this issue, I informed honourable members that the insurance industry had established representation and a process for lodging claims at every relief centre. Following the successful implementation of those arrangements, insurers are now commencing an adjustment of resources into the field to ensure that claims are processed as quickly as possible. The full establishment of the case management system, which has been outlined to the House by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, has been matched by a dramatic downturn in visits to relief centres, and insurers are continuing to adjust their resourcing to ensure that claims are assessed speedily. Insurers are continuing to maintain a presence at Alexandra, Yea and the Kinglake relief centres, as these locations are close to the damaged properties. I take this opportunity to say to the front-line insurance workers who are dealing with victims being exposed to distressing scenes and stories every day and doing their best to resolve issues as quickly as possible that we appreciate their work.As I have outlined to the House previously, there will inevitably be some disputation around some insurance claims. As the House will recall, the chief financial ombudsman, who has the power to issue binding decisions to resolve disputed claims, has established a bushfire and flood hotline. That number, for people listening, is 1800337444. The Financial Ombudsman Service has handled about 70 inquiries from bushfire affected policyholders and has been assisting those policyholders in dealing with their insurance companies. Last week I met with the chief executives of each major insurance company in Australia. Each of them indicated a desire to work proactively with the government to resolve issues as they arise, which we appreciate.I also thank those honourable members who have been in contact with me personally to discuss issues in their electorates. I will not detain the House with an update on each of those issues, other than to say that I appreciate the cooperative spirit with which those honourable members have engaged with the government to resolve issues that they have brought to our attention, and we have worked well together to resolve those issues. It is still relatively early days in terms of resolving all the insurance claims and issues arising out of the bushfires, but we will continue to work with honourable members affected, with the insurance companies and, where necessary, with the chief financial ombudsman to resolve these issues as they arise. I will keep the House updated with progress.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As I said in the parliament, the loss of jobs as a result of Pacific Brands' decision yesterday is regrettable for the economy, but it is distressing and devastating for individual workers. That is why every form of assistance available from the Commonwealth government to those individual workers will be provided.On the question raised just now by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, the industry minister has indicated that he had been in discussion with the company concerning their intended announcement. The key and responsible decision by the minister was to put this to the Chairman of Pacific Brands: 'Is there any form of government assistance which would prevent you from taking this course of action?' The answer was 'no'. That is the responsible course of action.Can I say more broadly on the question of industry policy action - which those opposite have resolutely opposed in relation to the car plan and in relation to everything else - that they speak with great double standards on the question of industry policy assistance, period. The industry minister has handled this matter entirely responsibly. I have been in close consultation with him and he has my full support.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. We have various developments in terms of the global economy which are of relevance, of course, to the unfolding strength of the Australian economy and the impact which flows on the question of jobs.It is important as we work our way through the implementation of the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan that we are always mindful of the fact that we are in the midst of a global economic recession. UK GDP contracted by 1.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, German GDP contracted 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter - the largest contraction since reunification in the early 1990s - and trade data from Japan showed a fall in Japanese exports of 45 per cent.President Obama addressed congress last night on the economic challenges facing the world and the United States. President Obama correctly called this 'a moment in history' because it is necessary for us all to be seized of its absolute importance, of as much as possible coordinated government action across the world. He described it as a day of reckoning and said that 'the time to take charge of our future is here'. President Obama outlined his fiscal stimulus plan to invest US$787 billion into the US economy. He said that over the next two years this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.President Obama also recognised the growing threat to prosperity, which lies in our credit markets. The President noted the flow of private credit is essential. He said:_ even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.                _            _            _The concern is that if we do not re-start lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even begins.You see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy. The ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education; how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.President Obama is absolutely right because what he is describing in his address to the United States congress is the challenge, of course, that we face right across the world, and that is the problem of global private credit supply. That is why in Australia we have acted in relation to particular challenges within individual credit markets, actions which, by and large, have been uniformly attacked by those opposite in relation to car dealership finance, in terms of the commercial property market and also in terms of residential mortgage-backed securities.That is why acting to restore the flow of lending to the private sector will be a key priority for the G20 leaders' summit on 2 April. We, together with others, are working hard with other G20 members to find an effective global solution to the problem of these banks' bad assets, as we are on restoring global growth and strengthening the regulatory framework for the financial system so as to minimise the prospect of future crises. These actions are necessary globally. The problem at present is that we see a range of uncoordinated, individual national actions in relation to the restoration of the health of private credit markets, and that continues as a core of the global economic challenge.This will be a difficult period ahead for the global economy. When we discuss job losses in Australia, which we will do a lot in this parliament as the year progresses, action can be taken nationally to support, stabilise and normalise Australian credit markets and to restore - to the greatest extent possible - private credit flows. We can act nationally also when it comes to nation building and jobs investment through a Nation Building and Jobs Plan - which each one of those opposite has voted against. I would recall, for the benefit of those opposite, the comments this morning by former Woolworths boss Roger Corbett, who said the following in relation to recent tactics by the Liberal and National parties in opposition to the stimulus package before the parliament:_ delay _is very, very counter-productive to the end result _He said:I think, generally, economic theory, sensible theory is that a package is needed and I think the community expects our governments operating in this crisis situation to act in a bipartisan way.He went on to say:I would like to call on the opposition here in NSW, (Opposition Leader) Barry O'Farrell and the federal people to pull together to close this gap because speed is of the essence.Roger Corbett from the business community, former CEO of Woolworths and, of course, with Reserve Bank experience, is a business person making plain to those opposite in his direct remarks that what is required here is for the nation to pull together in response to a Nation Building and Jobs Plan to provide the fiscal stimulus necessary to see Australia through the crisis.I heard the comments earlier today and last night from the shadow Treasurer calling for hope and optimism. Calling for hope and optimism is one thing; the monstrous contradiction between such a person doing so on the one hand and then predicting an economic recession 12 months later, I leave to one side. But calling for hope and optimism is a dead letter in the absence of a concrete strategy and plan for action. That concrete strategy and plan for action is represented by our $42 billion nation-building plan. This government has an economic strategy to see Australia through this crisis. Those opposed to us - the Liberal and National parties - have a political strategy that seeks to take political advantage from this crisis. Therein lies the difference.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. You can almost hear the glee in the question. - It certainly is a very serious question -  - and it is something that the government takes very seriously. That is why we have said repeatedly that the global recession will have a negative impact on employment in Australia. The global recession will have that impact, and it is going to have tragic consequences for too many Australians. That is why the government is so steely in its resolve to support employment through stimulus packages - first of all the Economic Security Strategy brought down last October and, of course, our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. They are all designed to support employment in this economy in the middle of a global recession, because there is only one certainty here: we would be much worse off if the government had not acted. That is something that those opposite simply refuse to acknowledge. They refuse to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem and they refuse to put forward any alternative whatsoever. They are a policy free zone.Looking at the pictures on television last night of those Pacific Brands workers only steels the government's determination to act and steels the government's determination to support employment. On this side of the House we will do everything within our power to support employment and to avoid unemployment. The only people in this country who want higher unemployment are those on that side of the House. There is something inherently un-Australian about the way they celebrate these figures. There most certainly is. Those opposite stand up and say they are for jobs and then come into the House and vote against jobs.We saw comments today from a leading Australian businessman, who is not associated with this side of the House, Mr Corbett. He is probably one of our most respected businessmen in this country. He made this point - and it represents what the business community is saying, it represents what the Australian Industry Group is saying, it represents what the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is saying, it represents what the Business Council of Australia is saying and it represents what everybody in this country, except those on the opposite side of the House, is saying. He said:Delay is very, very counterproductive to the end result.Mr Corbett called on federal and state oppositions not to stand in the way of government attempts to stimulate the economy. Mr Corbett went on to make this very sensible point - and this is a complete repudiation of everything that has been said in this House and in the Senate by the Liberal and National parties. He said:'I think, generally, economic theory, sensible theory is that a package is needed -  - I most certainly am responding to the question, Mr Speaker, because what Mr Corbett is saying is what the government is saying - that is, that the government must do everything within its power to support employment. He went on to say:'A package is needed and I think the community expects our governments operating in this crisis situation to act in a bipartisan way.'That was very clearly directed at those opposite. Mr Corbett is a respected Australian businessman, but he is also somebody who has an enormous amount of economic knowledge and experience and, of course, is quite familiar to the member for Higgins - because Mr Corbett was appointed to the Reserve Bank board by the member for Higgins. So he is somebody whose views were once respected, at any rate, by those opposite. I guess what those quotes really demonstrate is one thing: how out of touch the opposition is with the scale of the challenge and the nature of the response that is required in this country, because we are in the middle of the sharpest synchronised contraction of the global economy in our lifetime. - Unfortunately, the nation is in the middle of a global recession, one that no nation in this world can avoid. No nation can avoid it, but what nations can do is moderate the impact. That is what this government moved to do swiftly and decisively last October not only with the stimulus package but with the bank guarantee, both in the end opposed by the opposition, and of course with our Nation Building and Jobs Plan of February - voted against in this parliament by those opposite. You would think that the Leader of the Opposition would know better, but of course he does not. He ought to behave better, but of course he does not. If the consensus of opinion that would normally be associated with the Liberal Party in this House could support the Australian government in our endeavours to combat unemployment and to support employment in this country, why can't those opposite? I will tell you why they cannot: all they are concerned with is playing politics - point-scoring before policy - and they are unconcerned about what is occurring out there with those who have become unemployed.This government will do everything within its power to support employment in the Australian community. We will work with the whole of the Australian community to achieve our objective. If that leaves the opposition out there point-scoring, so be it. We would rather see them on our side of the House supporting this, not opposing it. But they have taken a crude political position, which reflects very poorly on the Leader of the Opposition, who simply wants to point-score at a very important time in our history.When President Obama spoke in the United States 24 hours ago -  -  - They do not like it, Mr Speaker. - Their tawdry strategy is exposed before all. The country wants unity. They do not want to see point-scoring from the other side of the House, and the unemployed most certainly do not deserve it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield and acknowledge his strong engagement with the farmers in his area and with making sure that they have a strong future ahead. Yesterday I was able to announce the next stage of research funding out of Australia's Farming Future, which is to make sure that farmers in the livestock industries are able to have tools at their disposal to be part of the effort in reducing emissions, particularly from the mouths of cattle, sheep and goats. There has been very little research done in this area, but it is actually the third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto protocol within Australia. This money and these projects will go toward exploring dietary supplements and alternative feeds to reduce methane production from livestock and looking at chemical or biological controls and also at genetic approaches such as selective breeding. This is all to make sure that, as Australia makes its effort to reduce emissions, farmers are able to have a very strong future.I regret to inform the House that there are other approaches which provide much less of a future for Australia's farmers. I discovered this a couple of nights ago while watching The 7.30 Report. I have to say the Leader of the Opposition on The 7.30 Report made absolutely compelling television. The commercial networks at the same time were showing Animal Rescue, Wipeout Australia and The Biggest Loser. I had to check which channel I was on. The Leader of the Opposition said:_ I did nothing more than rely on the work of Dr Phil Polglase from the CSIRO, who in his published work, which is cited in my paper, which I'm sure you've read - he said 'which I'm sure you have read'; he really said that - shows that you can abate 146 million tonnes of CO2 a year, with nine million hectares of planting _Nine million hectares of planting is an extraordinary amount of planting. There is no doubt that, as part of the effort to deal with climate change, more trees have to be planted. The modelling that was done for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was quite squarely focused on tree planting in marginal agricultural areas. So we went to the report to see what the Leader of the Opposition was relying on, because there are a number of different projections of how many trees you could plant. He chose the highest figure - 9.1 million hectares. There is a map on page 80 of the report of where those plantings would take place - and we have enlarged it and shaded it to make it clear.All the way up and down the Queensland coast there are people who are cane growers, who are deeply concerned about whether or not sugar mills are going to lose their capacity because so much prime agricultural land is being lost to tree production. Yet, under the Leader of the Opposition's plan, from Cairns to Townsville to Mackay to Rockhampton to Gladstone to Bundaberg - all the way down that Queensland sugar coast - there are dots for where he is planning to take prime agricultural land. I know there is none in Gladstone; it is between the dots when driving from place to place. All the way down there are dots on the map that have been chosen by the Leader of the Opposition to say where the prime agricultural land will be transferred to forestry. But it is not just there but the New England area. He has chosen agricultural land around Tamworth and agricultural land around Glen Innes and said, 'The future for farmers is that we will take out that prime agricultural land and we will plant trees there.' Even Nambour is on the list of areas.In Tasmania, the agricultural land between Launceston and Hobart is marked on the map as an area of prime agricultural land to be changed over for tree planting. Over in Western Australia, in the wheat belt, there are dots on some of our most productive land in the country. The Leader of the Opposition plans to make those places of prime agricultural land where forestry will take over from agriculture. At least the Independent members of this parliament can go back to their seats and say that they support a strong future for the farmers in their electorates. At least the member for Wakefield and other members on this side of the House representing country seats can go back and tell their farmers what they support. - The CSIRO provided a number of different projections. Only one person chose to engage with the highest level of projections and the ones that were on prime agricultural land - although, not on his farm, by the way! The Leader of the Opposition has adopted a scheme in which everyone is a winner - unless they require food. The Leader of the Opposition has designed a world where you will sequester heaps of carbon but there will be a lot less to eat. There is a reason it looks too good to be true - it is. - </DOC>

 - I am certainly disappointed to hear that that is the case. It is yet another demonstration of why the government has acted so decisively and so swiftly with our Economic Security Strategy and our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that those industries and those sectors are under a lot of pressure. That is why the government has moved swiftly to stimulate demand and, most particularly, to put direct investment into building and construction - something which has been opposed tooth and nail in this House by those opposite. You cannot come in here - after opposing every single measure put forward by the government to stimulate demand and push construction - and claim that somehow the government is responsible for it.We accept responsibility for the fact that we have to stimulate our economy. We have to give a significant boost to jobs, given the dramatic slowdown that is occurring in the global economy. We pointed to the fact that unemployment was going up when we put out our Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook in February and brought down our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. You can see the benefits of that coming through, but those opposite, because they want to score a political point, will not acknowledge what is happening out there. They will not acknowledge the fact that retail sales in December were up - at the highest level since 2001. They will not acknowledge that. They will not acknowledge the substantial boost that is happening in the housing sector because of our first home owner boost. They certainly will not acknowledge that.Our message is that the government will do everything we possibly can to stimulate demand and to ensure that credit flows through the system. That is why we put in place the bank guarantee, which was opposed tooth and nail by those opposite but which the Governor of the Reserve Bank has acknowledged was absolutely important in avoiding some very traumatic events in our financial system last October. They will not support our initiative of supplying credit to the property sector. They have opposed that tooth and nail. I do not even know whether they supported our special purpose vehicle for car dealerships. This government has been very active. We have been responsible in what we have done, because we acknowledge the size of the problem - something that those opposite simply refuse to do. If they want to have any credibility when it comes to the vital area of property, they should be supporting our $4 billion Australian Business Investment Partnership, which is being put in place to secure finance in the commercial property sector - something that they are opposing tooth and nail because they will not recognise the risk to our economy if foreign banks pull out of banking syndicates. - So all of this simply demonstrates how unqualified, how unprepared, those opposite are to deal with this situation. But the government will continue to act forcefully and decisively in the face of all of these events that are being imposed upon us by the international economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question, and I thank him for the welcome that I had from him in Cairns last week. I was there to announce some $900,000 of support for community infrastructure, including the upgrade of 13 sportsgrounds and pools and 18 community halls across the region. These are some of the things that this government is doing - supporting jobs and the local economy in Cairns - which are opposed by those opposite.I was also in Townsville last week and there I announced over $1 million to support a pedestrian walkway to the Cowboys home ground at Dairy Farmers Stadium and to support water conservation measures at the council buildings there. This side of the House is supporting jobs and the local economy in Townsville; they are opposed by that side of the House.This week we have also announced $1.3 million for the Sunshine Coast Regional Council in the electorate of Wide Bay. A quarter of a million dollars of that is for a new walkway and cycleway along the Noosa River. The local economy and jobs in Noosa are supported by this side of the House; they are opposed by that side of the House.We have announced $2.1 million for Dalby Regional Council. We are funding 28 separate projects, including the upgrading of the main streets in Dalby and Chinchilla in the electorate of Maranoa. It was voted against by that side of the House and once again the local economy and jobs have been supported by this side of the House. This week Toowoomba has got $1.8 million for 21 separate projects in the electorate of Groom. On this side of the House we are supporting jobs and local economies; they are opposed by that side of the House.We have already supported some 3,600 projects, which are being delivered by local government. Each one of the 565 local authorities throughout Australia is being given funding to support local jobs and to stimulate their local economies. But what is the response to it of members opposite? Perhaps it was best summed up by the member for Warringah, when he showed his renowned people skills yet again this week. He described it as $42 billion being blown in low-quality spending.What I say to those members opposite is: when you look at the spending in their local communities - including $220,000 for the Warringah Aquatic Centre to be upgraded; including extra funding for the Warringah Library at Warringah Mall; including spending to upgrade the kitchens at Forestville Senior Citizens Centre - go along to those local communities and tell them that you voted against the local jobs being created and against the stimulation of local economies. That is exactly what those opposite have done. They know that local capital works are a very effective way of creating jobs and stimulating local economies. - I was in Townsville with the Liberal Mayor of Townsville for the announcement of the project chosen by the Liberal controlled Townsville City Council. The benefit of this program is that we are not deciding what is funded; local communities are - your communities in your electorates - and do not think we will not remind each and every one of you that you opposed this every step of the way, including in Townsville.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and note how unusual it is to get a question on education from those opposite. If the shadow minister asking the question had got to the bottom of these facts, he would have realised that the expenditure he refers to includes a training seminar for teachers. I actually believe that supporting teachers to be better teachers in their classrooms is not a waste of money.So, if I could refer the member to the seminar for 209 teachers led by Martin Seligman, I note his attempt to parody what Martin Seligman did at that seminar, but I say to the members opposite that Professor Seligman is a noted educationalist from the University of Pennsylvania. He is the leader in the development of the Penn Resiliency Program. That program has been shown to make a difference -  -  - You will not be laughing in a second. That program has been shown to make a difference to mental health issues amongst young people, including issues like anorexia and depression. That is actually serious and ought not to be catcalled about. People in this country, I believe, are concerned about mental health issues for teenagers. Perhaps those members calling out are not. But if they are not concerned about those things then they are clearly out of touch with the value system of Australians. Australians are concerned about those things.Professor Seligman held a seminar - yes, for which a subsidy was made available through my department - for 209 teachers. The member used a figure that also included expenditure on this. I can certainly refer the member to the fact that this seminar was attended by teachers across the country, including teachers in South Australia, who came there to learn from those professional development activities. So perhaps in their haste to make a cheap political point the Liberal Party might like to think through these issues. Are they concerned about mental health issues amongst young people - yes or no? Do they recognise that Professor Seligman's program has been recognised around the world as making a difference to those mental health issues amongst young people? And, therefore, should they consider whether supporting teachers to get access to that kind of curriculum and professional development is a good idea or a bad idea? Before they keep making cheap political points maybe they should just spend a moment reflecting on each of those things.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. I had the opportunity to be in his electorate last week, where we held a seminar with the school principals in his electorate to talk about the Building the Education Revolution initiative. What was remarkable is that people who care about education and people who lead schools were delighted to see this program and were full of energy and goodwill in working with the government in delivering it. People who care about education have that approach to this program. They want to be there; they want to be working with the government delivering it.What was also remarkable was that these school leaders could see that this not only was going to be of benefit to their school through the new facilities and upgrades that it promised but was going to be of benefit to their community, because they understand, in a way that members of the Liberal Party in this House clearly do not, that the global financial crisis and global recession are going to impact on their communities. So they want to be part of a program that will make a long-term difference to education and that will make a difference to economic activity and support jobs in their local community.People who care about education and people who care about jobs have shown that goodwill at all levels. The Prime Minister, on 6 February, hosted a forum here for education stakeholders. It was attended by around 50 people. Once again, there was energy and enthusiasm for this investment in education and this support for local jobs. The program guidelines have now been released, and I can report that since 4 February there have been eight meetings with all state and territory education departments and the various block grant authorities of the Catholic and independent schools systems. In addition, there has been work and discussion with the Australian principals forum and the independent schools association. All of this work is going in so that the program can be delivered. It is ambitious in its delivery time. We want to deliver it quickly. And those who care about education and those who care about supporting local jobs, like the people I have just referred to, are working alongside us.It is startling to me that, when you survey the education community and the people who do care about its future, there is that degree of enthusiasm, yet in this House amongst members opposite there is the degree of opposition and catcalling that we have seen displayed towards this program. - The shadow Treasurer, who interjects now, described it as ridiculous. The member for Warringah described it as a low-quality spend. And, of course, the Leader of the Opposition leads the Liberal Party in voting against this program and voting against the jobs that it will support. It should cause Liberal members to reflect, when they see the education community seizing this historic investment - this huge opportunity to have 21st-century facilities in schools - that they are there opposed.There was discussion and debate in this House today about opening ceremonies in relation to this program, and I will reiterate what I said then - that of course schools will be able to invite local members opposite. I sincerely hope they come, because when they go to those opening ceremonies the only honest way for those Liberal Party members to conduct themselves would be to say, in front of the assembled parents, principals, teachers and students, that they are members of the Liberal Party, they do not believe that facility should have been built, they do not believe that it should be there for students, they do not believe that it should be there for teachers, they do not believe that it should be there for principals, they voted against it and, had they been in government, it would not have happened. That would be the only honest way for them to conduct themselves when they go, and I trust that they will go and conduct themselves in that honest way and say, 'We were opposed to all of this.'</DOC>

 - First of all, as the minister indicated in his statements yesterday and the day before, he took action on 22 October. That was reinforced by a direction to the Chief of Army in February. Secondly, I would draw the honourable member's attention to the statement made - I believe yesterday - by the Chief of the Defence Force that, when it comes to any matter relating to the chain of command and any statement by any member or communication by any member of the SAS, no retribution would ensue. I take the Chief of the Defence Force at his word.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As we have been saying earlier in the day, this country is experiencing the full impact of a global recession, but it does remain the case that we are better placed than most other countries in this environment; nevertheless, we cannot completely resist the pull of global economic forces.We certainly do welcome today's CAPEX data. The numbers are stronger than were expected for the last three months of 2008, and that is certainly welcome. The figures show that new capital expenditure - that is, investment in business machinery and equipment and in building and structures - rose by six per cent in the December quarter. But unfortunately the figures also confirm a slowing in business investment plans for the period ahead. The figures show that business expectations for capital expenditure in the first half of 2009 are 8.5 per cent lower than businesses had planned for in September. Of course, we said in the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook that the global recession and the unwinding of the mining boom would see falls in business investment. Indeed, UEFO forecast that business investment will fall substantially through this year and next. We have seen substantial falls in business investment elsewhere in the world. In the UK business investment fell by 3.9 per cent in the last three months of last year; in the US by 5.2 per cent; and in Japan it fell by 5.3 per cent in December.The government is going to do everything within its power to support jobs and growth in the face of this global recession. That is why we are so determined to put in place swiftly our Nation Building and Jobs Plan to support demand, given the expected fall in business investment. That is why almost three-quarters of our Nation Building and Jobs Plan is direct investment - direct investment in our schools, direct investment in our homes, direct investment in our roads and direct investment in our communities. That is important direct investment given the shock to our economy being imposed by this synchronised global recession which is now occurring across both developed and developing countries. It is also why we put in place the small business and general business tax break to provide greater incentives for business to invest in the future. It is also why we put in place the bank guarantee to ensure that our banks have the capacity to continue to fund business investment. If businesses cannot get access to credit they cannot invest. So that bank guarantee has been very, very important to ensure there is a flow of credit to the Australian economy.What do those opposite say? What is their alternative approach? We heard from the shadow Treasurer on Lateline last night that his policy is to sit and hope. The policy of those on this side of the House is to take action, to be very active in the face of this global recession and to put in place a direct investment which will support Australian jobs, build our community and leave lasting benefits for the nation. Nothing could be more important for this country at the moment than for government to take an active role to combat what is being imposed upon us so savagely by the rest of the world. That is why I do welcome the CAPEX figures that came out today. They are a surprise on the upside, but of course we have the other news on the other side - that expectations are for less investment. What that shows is the wisdom of the government's action to put in place this direct investment through our Nation Building and Jobs Plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The simple answer is: because I was only aware of one of the calls. The buck stops with me on this issue. But, in the first instance, calls on SAS pay problems go to my colleague the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. I had feedback about one phone call. From there, there is a set process. They are referred to the department for investigation and action. The important thing here, of course, is that these phone calls came in February. When learning of this problem last year, in October, I put an immediate stop on the recovery payments. - The member for Paterson was outside the doors this morning claiming that I did not put an immediate stop on the recovery action. - I now table the internal defence paper trail, which acknowledges my direction and shows the stop on the recovery being put into effect. The member for Paterson interjected and said, 'That's not true.' He claims I did not stop it for 120 days because he has a pay slip showing a zero payment. I asked the opposition yesterday to share that pay slip with me so that I could get to the bottom of the issue. It left me perplexed because, having been assured that my stop had been put into effect almost immediately, I could not understand why someone would continue to have overpayments deducted. Very sadly, the opposition chose yesterday not to share that pay slip with me, despite my request. I suggested that all names and any identifiers could be blanked out. I was looking for some cooperation to ensure that Defence had promptly acted on my instruction to immediately stop the deductions. Fortunately, I now have a copy of the same pay slip, I believe.That pay slip for that fortnight shows that the member concerned had a net pay on that day of $2,749.06, of which $1,956 went into his Westpac account and $778 went into the Defence Force Credit Union. I do not expect people in the House to be able to read this, but at the bottom of the pay slip it says, 'Entitlement: 00.' I am happy to compare notes with the opposition to make sure it is the same document, but I am very, very confident it is. The '00' down the bottom is the result of the last box on the pay slip. The box reflects quite complex calculations and adjustments which go to the debts that appear against the soldier's name for various reasons, including, I think, the implementation of the tribunal's decision. But no money has been deducted for that debt - which, by the way, was extinguished as of 18 February. This soldier no longer has any debt relating to the implementation of the Remuneration Tribunal's decision. He could have other debts for other reasons, as members of the ADF often do - for overpayments et cetera - but, as of the Chief of Army's directive of 18 February, this soldier no longer has any debt on that basis.The whole politicisation of this SAS matter this week has been based on this pay slip, which the opposition have claimed resulted in the soldier being paid zero. Either the opposition are very dumb and cannot read the pay slip properly or they misrepresented the facts. I will leave it to members of the Australian community and, in particular, the men and women of the Australian Defence Force - and, even more importantly, the men and women of the SAS Regiment - to decide which it is. When Senator Johnston rightly - well, not rightly, because I think he should have brought it to me - brought up this matter for the first time in October estimates last year, he finished by saying:I am very much obliged to the efforts you - that is, Chief of Army - have taken. I thank you for that. I will write to you if there are any further issues so that we might resolve them privately from here on in. Thank you very much.Senator Johnston decided that this SAS issue was too sensitive to continue to pursue in the public domain. Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition decided something different.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question and his concern for students and out-of-work Australians in his electorate. The $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan will help, of course, combat the challenges of the global financial crisis. We need to assist those acquiring educational qualifications and vocational training to ensure that they - and, indeed, we as a nation - are ready to take advantage when the economy improves.An important aspect of the jobs plan is the training and learning bonus to help current students as well as unemployed people returning to study or training. The bonus has two components: first, a one-off bonus of $950 for full-time students and apprentices receiving youth allowance and for recipients of Austudy and Abstudy as of 3 February this year; second, a temporary supplement to the education entry payment of $950 for the period 1 January this year to 30 June next year. This is in addition to the existing education entry payment of $208. The government will also temporarily expand eligibility for the education entry payment, and therefore the bonus, to unemployed youth undergoing approved training and receiving youth allowance. By extending the eligibility of this group, we are giving young people every chance to gain the skills and training they need in very difficult economic circumstances. Finally, we are also making it easier for people to get this payment by reducing the qualifying period from 12 months to one month. It is now more important than ever that people can participate in education and training in order to improve their skills and in order to ensure that they can be employed over the months and years ahead.The support that we are providing to out-of-work Australians undergoing training and those students would not have happened if it were left to those opposite. They voted against this particular payment which provides support to students and the unemployed undergoing training in their electorates. They voted against the plan, against supporting students in times of need and against supporting the unemployed who are undergoing training which will provide the skills that employers need. The Leader of the Opposition and indeed the shadow Leader of the Opposition, the member for Higgins, clearly do not appreciate the scale of the global financial crisis and the consequences it will have for this nation. If they did, they would have supported the government in the measures we have outlined in the Nation Building and Jobs Plan and the measures I have outlined in the House today. Unfortunately, the opposition are self-absorbed and self-indulgent and they have acted recklessly and irresponsibly in attempting to block the measures that have been put in place by the government to support Australian businesses, Australian workers, Australian students and those Australians who find themselves out of work.</DOC>

 - There is nothing like seeing the Leader of the Liberal Party in theatrical high dudgeon. It is worthy of an Academy Award. If the honourable member and the member for Curtin had bothered to check their facts, they would have noted that these matters were addressed by the Minister for Defence in a statement to parliament earlier today. I refer to the Minister for Defence's statement to the House, which says:_ I wish to advise that during the past four months the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and I have received a number of emails and phone calls from members of the Defence Force and the public expressing concern about this matter.That is what he said this morning - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for the question. It is my great pleasure to advise the House that today the Prime Minister and I announced at Just-Rite Insulation and Home Improvements in Fyshwick the fast-tracking of support for green jobs with the launch of the early installation guidelines for the $4 billion Energy Efficient Homes package. Through these guidelines released today, there will be the oppostunity for nearly three million dwellings to have ceiling insulation installed - that is, 2.2 million owner-occupiers will be eligible for up to $1,600 for ceiling insulation and some 700,000 landlords or tenants will be eligible for rebates of up to $1,000 for ceiling insulation. That means work coming through the doors now in the suburbs and cities of Australia. I should also point out that the solar hot water rebate has also been boosted under this package from $1,000 to $1,600, with no means test in place - a means test that was put in place by my predecessor as environment minister, the now Leader of the Opposition.Households can get started, because these guidelines are now available. They just need to go online to see whether they are eligible, arrange for a tradie to come and get the work done and send in their receipt, and then they will get paid for it. That is great news for small business; it means work is coming in the door now. I also want to point out to the House that from 1 July this year the Energy Efficient Homes program will step up again with a free call direct booking and installation service, making it even easier for households to arrange installation. The toll-free number is 1800808571 and the online register and guidelines are at www.environment.gov.au/energyefficiency. Early installation guidelines are available now so that benefits can flow to businesses, to homes and to the economy. If Australians want to get ceiling insulation up and running now, they can.But I notice that that is not the only online register that has been announced. Following the member for Tangney's launch of an online petition yesterday stating that the world is not warming at an unusual rate or magnitude and that emissions trading should not go ahead, I thought that there is an interesting choice of websites for people who are listening to the House today to refer to. I table the member for Tangney's online petition. When asked about who is responsible for climate change, the member for Tangney said that humans are not causing climate change. When it was pointed out to him that the opposition leader says - and it is true; it is on the record - that humans are affecting the climate and that the problem must be addressed, the member for Tangney said that he differs with his leader on that. When he was then asked how reporters should sum up the opposition's climate change policy, the member for Tangney saids:I'll leave that to you to determine.We have seen more and more different positions on responding to climate change from the opposition: low targets, high targets, no targets, carbon tax and - the last refuge of the cynics and the sceptics - climate denial. At this point in the week, when we finish the kind of week that we have had with the opposition opposing the delivery of a job-creating program that will put ceiling insulation in the homes of Australians, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: get your house in order, get on board -  - The Australian public is looking for coherent policy delivery on the challenges that we face now. You are all over the place on climate change. We are delivering ceiling insulation, jobs and assistance to householders that need it most.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I know he is well representing the interests of his constituents, particularly their concerns about what is happening with Port Macquarie council. Firstly, in terms of debt exposure on the part of local authorities, their public sector borrowing requirement in general and their public finance management in general: Australia's constitutional arrangements primarily place that, as the honourable member knows, within the purview of state government. That is the first point.He also raises the question about the problems encountered by a number of universities around Australia in terms of their exposure to what has happened with CDOs worldwide and other forms of securitisation of assets, which have subsequently become bad assets in terms of the overall health of their finances. The financial arrangements of the universities as a matter of general principle, because they all exist under state statute, fall within a similar category. However, the honourable member legitimately raises the question about the overall impact of the global financial crisis spreading through to the public finances of various instrumentalities across the Federation. I can assure the honourable member that the Commonwealth Treasury is actively engaged with state and territory counterparts about the overall problems in various sectors.On the question of local government which the honourable member raises, I would draw his attention to the fact that we have been exceptionally mindful of the financial burden being faced by local government across the nation. I believe that 565-plus local authorities attended the Australian Council of Local Government's meeting in Canberra at the end of last year. What was plain from my discussions with many of the mayors and shire presidents, and from the discussion they had with the minister for local government, was that they were already being impacted by the deterioration of the rate base as a consequence of the wash-through impact of the global financial crisis. That has been one of the reasons why in the period since we held that council meeting in Canberra, the first in the Federation's history, the minister for infrastructure has released an $800 million community infrastructure package for local governments to deliver across the country. The objective is twofold. First, we understand the pressure which local authority budgets are now under because of the downstream consequences of the global financial crisis on the rate base and, in some cases, the extent to which they have been exposed by investments of the type which the honourable member describes. It is not just that $800 million package which is designed to provide some support for local authorities' funding arrangements at present. On top of that, the enhanced funding for Roads to Recovery and the Black Spot Program has been designed with a similar intent. On the questions which the honourable member raises, I would invite him to remain in continued liaison with the Treasurer and his office as we examine the public finance impacts through the Treasury of these instrumentalities across the country.</DOC>

 - The government has put in place a $42 billion package, the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, in order to stimulate economic activity, to stimulate growth and to support jobs in the Australian economy - all critical to the wellbeing of working people in this country. We are in the face of extraordinary developments in the international economy. We have seen growth going backwards big-time in economies like the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, many parts of Europe and other parts of Asia. The opposition has put forward an alternative stimulus package, approximately half the magnitude of that advocated by the government, that is purportedly based on tax cuts - one would assume mostly tax cuts favouring the better off.In a debate with me on Lateline a couple of Friday evenings ago, the now shadow Treasurer, then shadow finance minister, was asked to name commentators and economists who supported this approach - who supported the coalition's alternative. He was unable to name a single one. He was unable to answer that question. Seeking to determine what the position of opposition members is on the opposition's package, journalists on the doors today asked a number of members of the opposition what their package would have done with respect to the job losses at Pacific Brands. The opposition has been very keen to blame the government, to say that the government's package had failed to prevent those job losses and to imply that their alternatives would have done something about those job losses. So I would like to run through some of the answers to these questions from journalists about what conceivably could have happened had the opposition's package been in place.First, the member for Tangney, who was perhaps the most honest, if a little bit gauche, said, 'There's no specific guarantee of that' - in other words, 'No, our package would not have done anything.' The member for Boothby was asked, 'Would your package have prevented these job losses?' and his answer was, 'Let's talk about the $10 billion stimulus package' - in other words, 'I don't want to answer.' The member for Moncrieff was asked whether he could guarantee that the Pacific Brands job losses would not have occurred had the Liberal package been in place and he said, 'That's your assertion.' Finally, the member for Gippsland was asked about the Pacific Brands issue and whether the coalition's package would have prevented those job losses and he said, 'The government's spending should have been directed at small business.' That is hardly a ringing endorsement of the Liberal Party approach, given that Pacific Brands is hardly a small business.This follows in the wake of the coalition's absolute confusion with respect to the other part of the government's package: infrastructure investment. When that legislation was put to the parliament at the end of last year the Liberal Party set a new record. For the first time in the history of this parliament, the members from one major party voted three different ways - some voted for the legislation, some voted against the legislation and some abstained. 
A government member - Some of them got lost. - Yes, some of them got lost, got stuck in the lift, went to the toilet or whatever. That added to the confusion, of course, because some National Party members voted against it. I note that, when the now shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, was asked by the media in the wake of his promotion why the coalition had supported the government's $10 billion stimulus package and was now opposing it, his response was, 'I wasn't terribly involved in our response to the $10 billion package.' I wonder what portfolio he held at the time. He was actually shadow minister for finance. Ten billion dollars was on the block and he 'wasn't really involved in the coalition's response'. -  - Last year, the member for North Sydney advised the House that the only thing that united the Liberal Party was hatred of the Labor Party. They must be getting more friendly towards us, because there is not much uniting them at the moment. -  - I will bring my answer to a conclusion, Mr Speaker. In the space of 15 months, the Treasurer and I have been faced by no fewer than three shadow Treasurers and three shadow finance ministers. One wonders how many there will have been by the time we get to the election.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am not surprised by the fact that industrial relations did not form part of his first question today. Those who observed his press conference just now will be wondering what, in fact, the opposition's policy on industrial relations is, as of five past two this afternoon.The Leader of the Opposition asked a question about the impact of the government's economic stimulus strategy on employment. I refer to the fact that in the most recent national accounts Australia was still able to generate positive growth in consumption of 0.1 per cent for the December quarter - against a G7 average decline of something like 0.4 per cent. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that consumption is critical because of its impact on the retail sector. It represents 57 per cent of demand in the economy. The retail sector generates 1½ million Australian jobs. If consumption and retail are doing okay in Australia, there is a positive impact on jobs. Therefore, the impact of our stimulus strategy is of direct relevance to those people employed in that sector, which represents 14 per cent of the Australian workforce.The figures show that retail trade rose by 3.8 per cent in December 2008 and then grew by a further 0.2 per cent in January. Contrast that performance with, say, Canada, where it fell by 5.4 per cent in December; the US, where it fell by three per cent in December; Japan, where it fell by 1.9 per cent in December; Germany, where it was down by nearly one per cent in December; and New Zealand, where it fell by one per cent in December. I draw to the honourable gentleman's attention that Westfield, a large owner of shopping centres in Australia, saw an increase in sales of 2.5 per cent in December 2008. Their stores in the US saw falls of 14 per cent and the UK was down three per cent. I could draw the honourable member's attention to what Michael Luscombe, the CEO of Woolworths, had to say. In talking about the impact of the economic stimulus strategy, he said on 28 February:_ we saw it in the basic commodities and that's been made pretty public. I would think there's a little bit more legs in it, and there's no doubt that the timing of the next one which is around March/April is probably about the right time for the next one to come on.The Leader of the Opposition needs also to reflect on comments by others about the impact of the stimulus strategy. Deutsche Bank, through its chief economist, said: 'Retailers were bolstered by the cash-bonus-inspired strength in sales, and they responded in January by' - wait for it - 'retaining higher than usual post-Christmas staff levels'. I also refer to comments by the ANZ senior economist, Katie Dean, who believes that the government's stimulus package worked to retain jobs in January, in tandem with aggressive interest rate cuts. Michael Blythe, the Commonwealth Bank chief economist, said:Policy is working in Australia. Lower interest rates and the first-home owners grant have lifted housing activity, and the pick-up in retail sales suggests the Government's cash handouts have worked.So you have the chief economists from the Commonwealth Bank, the ANZ Bank and Deutsche Bank, as well as leaders in the Australian commercial sector, from Woolworths, all pointing to the relative positive impact of December's economic stimulus strategy on jobs and on overall sales; yet the only person who seems to be disputing its impact on jobs and sales is the Leader of the Opposition.I would ask the Leader of the Opposition why, when he asks a question on this, the question is premised on the assumption that the opposition is opposed to this particular measure. When this was announced at the end of last year, the Leader of the Opposition said that he, the opposition, would be supporting it. On 14 October, when we released this, he said, 'We are not going to argue about the composition of the package or quibble about it. It has our support.' That was in October last year. - Those opposite and those observing the debate know precisely where this government stand: we support the economic stimulus strategy. Why? Because, although it cannot remove the impact of the global economic cyclone which is the global economic recession, it can cushion its impact on Australia - on families and on jobs here. We know where we stand on this, but where does the Liberal Party stand? When these measures were introduced, the Leader of the Opposition said:We support these measures and we are particularly pleased about the measure, the payments to pensioners.That was last year. Is the Leader of the Opposition now saying - today, in March - that he opposed the payment to pensioners? -  - He mysteriously finds himself buried in his notes. Then we had this question: 'What do you think of the housing measures?' The response from the Leader of the Opposition was: 'Well, we support it.' Does the Leader of the Opposition oppose the trebling of the first home owners bonus? - If the Manager of Opposition Business had listened to my earlier answer concerning the impact of the economic stimulus strategy on jobs in the retail sector, including the quotes from those who lead in the retail sector, he would understand its impact on jobs, which was the question I was asked.Then, on family payments, the Leader of the Opposition was asked again - last October - about this, and he said:I think there are certainly people that have won a lot more than others, but again our position, Charles - this is Charles Wooley - was, in the spirit of the times, we give the Government our support on this.That was an eternity ago; that was three months ago. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition saying that his position is entirely the reverse of that. Is it any wonder that here we are at 10 minutes past two, on this day - when industrial relations legislation is about to pass through the Senate - and nobody knows where the Liberal Party stand on industrial relations and the future of Work Choices, because nobody knows where they stand on the economic stimulus strategy, because they make it up as they go along. I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to come clean with the Australian people and tell them whether he supports or opposes these payments - depending on which day of the week it is.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question and I record for the House her advocacy on behalf of workers and working families in her electorate in Brisbane. I noticed, as the honourable member for Petrie asked the question, there was a distinct silence on the part of those opposite, reflecting, shall we say, a want of unity on their part and a lack of clarity in terms of their position on this vital matter for the nation, the economy and working families.Before the last election, we made a commitment to hardworking Australians that, under this government, their terms and conditions of employment would be fair and they would be protected. Before the last election, we made a commitment to Australian employers that, under the government's new workplace relations laws, our system would be flexible, simple and workable for business. Before the election, we made a commitment that we would consult with employers and employees alike as we drafted our workplace laws.This Labor government has delivered on that commitment. What does the new workplace relations system entail? First, it includes a simple safety net of key terms and conditions that cannot be stripped away - stripped away by industrial instruments such as Work Choices. Second, it includes protection from unfair dismissal for Australian workers, balanced with the opportunity for an employer to have a period to assess a new worker. Third, it includes special arrangements for small business employers to deal with dismissals, and simpler processes for everyone to resolve claims. Fourth, it entails provisions to help workers and employers and employees work together to create flexible and family friendly workplaces. Fifth, it includes simpler and faster agreement-making processes. Sixth, it provides for a new, independent umpire, Fair Work Australia. Seventh, it provides the opportunity for employers and employees to agree to flexible arrangements that suit their needs, including for high-income workers.I would say to the parliament and to those opposite that this party in government did not hide its plans from the Australian people prior to the last election. We were upfront with the Australian people. We told them what we would do, and the Australian people overwhelmingly voted for our proposal and for the removal of Work Choices. I contrast that with those opposite, who inflicted Work Choices on Australia without the courtesy of even putting it to the Australian people first. I would ask any of those opposite: which of them stood around the ballot boxes in 2004 and said to the Australian people as they went into that election that they were going to legislate Work Choices? Not one of them did. Their party did not. Once they obtained control of the Senate, that was the direction in which they went.The reason for that is that their fundamental belief is that Work Choices is absolutely fantastic - the ideal set of laws for every workplace. And that was what underpinned remarks and statements made in this place when they introduced Work Choices legislation into this parliament. Again, for the benefit of those opposite let me record for the House, on this important day, what the Leader of the Opposition said on the day that Work Choices was introduced:_ today is the day that Kevin Andrews - the then minister - introduced the work choices legislation into the House of Representatives. The single most important reform to workplace relations in any of our lifetimes _There is no understatement there: 'in any of our lifetimes'.What we have had ever since then is this to and fro in the tactical debate within the Liberal Party as to whether they should be upfront about what they actually believe - which is Work Choices writ large - or whether they can tactically sneak around the side and pretend that they are actually not committed to it after all. We on this side of the House - and the nation at large - know this as a fact: Work Choices is within the DNA of the Liberal Party. Whatever they may say today about whether they oppose it or support it, we all know that, if they got back into power, they would bring it back because it is in their DNA. That is the bottom line.In the debate about the global economic recession and its impact on families and workers across Australia, I say to those opposite that they should reflect for one moment on this simple question: what do they say to Australian workers who have a 'take it or leave it' Work Choices AWA, when they realise that their Work Choices AWA does not have a redundancy entitlement? Under Work Choices, it was stripped away from them without a choice and without compensation. That is the simple truth of it. What would those opposite do for those workers who now face the full force of the global economic recession? Absolutely nothing, because their industrial relations legislation provided the capacity for workers to be put on AWAs that strip away their redundancy arrangements.This is the human face of Work Choices - Work Choices, which is in the DNA of the Liberal Party; Work Choices, which stripped away redundancy entitlements; and Work Choices, which they, the Liberal Party, would wish to bring back. Whatever the Liberal Party may say today in this debate, whatever they may say in the Senate in this debate and whatever posturing they may engage in politically on this matter, the Liberal Party cannot and never will be able to walk away from Work Choices - because, very simply, the Liberal Party are Work Choices addicts. That is what they are - Work Choices addicts. They will swear until they are blue in the face that they have given it up but, we know for a fact that, as Work Choices addicts, they cannot give it up. That is the bottom line.As much as those opposite may be uncomfortable about the core reality, the absolute core reality is that Work Choices strips away redundancy payments. Whatever they say today about maybe pushing it to one side - and heaven knows what the Leader of the Opposition meant in that last press conference - we in the government know that we stand opposed to Work Choices, while the Liberal Party, if they get back in office, will restore Work Choices and enforce it on every Australian working family.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition would be aware that most mainstream economists and most leaders of business organisations in Australia have said that, in the midst of a global financial crisis and a global economic recession, the responsible thing for governments to do is to go into temporary deficit on the basis of temporary borrowing. Those opposite, if they were faintly honest about their own position and the costs associated with their own position - which we calculate to be $180 billion worth of undertakings on their part - would agree that they would be in precisely the same position. Let us just be honest about this in this chamber. Those opposite are pretending that at this point they would not be in deficit. That is untrue, because those opposite would be confronted with exactly the same reality that we have been confronted with in government with collapsing government revenues. So either you balance the budget in terms of the necessary recourse to borrowings or you simply act irresponsibly in the current global economic environment. Those opposite, presumably, would have us act irresponsibly.The bottom line is this: whether it is the International Monetary Fund, the Business Council of Australia or the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, every responsible mainstream business organisation stands up with the government to say that, in this time of national economic emergency, a global economic recession which is washing across the shores of Australia, this is the time for governments to engage in temporary deficit and temporary borrowing in order to provide economic stimulus to the economy. The result of that is to cushion the impact of the global economic recession. The alternative on the part of those opposite is this: to simply throw people to the wolves; simply allow them to fend for themselves, as they would have working families do under their prescription on industrial relations.Our policy on these matters is clear; those opposite seek to evade their responsibilities on this and not be clear about the extent of their own undertakings by way of policy, where that would land them in terms of deficit and the recourse which they would then have to undertake by way of temporary borrowings. We stand with the mainstream business organisations of the nation, acting responsibly to cushion the impact of the recession now. The relative economic data on Australia in the fourth quarter last year measured against most of the rest of the OECD demonstrates the positive impact which a temporary stimulus has. I would recommend to the Leader of the Opposition that he look hard at the examples which come from overseas and that he own up, directly and honestly, about the impact that his own undertakings on policy would produce in terms of deficit and debt.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and note his deep interest and active involvement in putting together the government's Fair Work Bill. The Fair Work Bill brings to a culmination what the Australian Labor Party promised the Australian people in the lead-up to the 2007 election. We promised them an end to Work Choices. We promised them a fair, flexible and balanced workplace relations system.We announced our policy Forward with Fairness in April 2007. We campaigned for it every day in the lead-up to the 2007 election, and the Australian people endorsed it. Every day since, we have worked in a consultative way with employers, with unions, with those interested in delivering a fair, flexible and balanced workplace relations system. We have worked with a business advisory group, a small business working group, a workers advisory group, the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council and the Committee on Industrial Legislation - meeting for an unprecedented number of days, working with the legislation. We introduced it into the House of Representatives last November and it has been to an extensive Senate committee inquiry. We did not sneak up on anybody with this bill. Everybody knew that this bill would be in the Senate for decision this week.What did the Leader of the Opposition say when this bill came into the parliament? He said:We - the coalition - accept that WorkChoices is dead. The Australian people have spoken.They were the words of the Leader of the Opposition last November. They were driven by opportunism, no doubt, but Australian people listening to those words would have thought that the coalition was going to get out of the way and allow Work Choices to be brought to an end, to kill Work Choices and have a fair and flexible system introduced. And it seemed that that might happen - that was, until the member for Higgins appeared on the Today show last week and said:It - the government - has to reconsider its proposals in relation to industrial relations.So the Liberal Party went into its party room today, and the people of Australia waited. Who was going to determine the Liberal Party's position on Work Choices? Was it the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Higgins? - Well, now we know that it is not the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Higgins. - The startling truth is: no-one is determining their position, because they do not know what to say next. The Liberal Party gathered today to kill Work Choices and then just could not bring themselves to do it. As I am advised, the shadow cabinet went to the party meeting with no recommendation about what to do next. As I am advised, the people who hold themselves out as the alternative government of this country in the middle of a global financial crisis could not work out whether or not to kill a piece of legislation that makes it easier to sack a worker. People who were there in a party room were asked whether or not they wanted to end a piece of legislation that made it easier to sack a worker and they stayed in the embrace of Work Choices. -  - I can understand the catcalls to cover their embarrassment - the Leader of the Opposition: repudiated; the member for Higgins, the architect of Work Choices: seeking to drive the embrace of Work Choices even further; the Liberal Party gathered to kill Work Choices and they could not bring themselves to do it. Before today we knew that the Liberal Party is and always will be the party of Work Choices. After today we know that that is true and we also know that they are a hopeless rabble and joke, unable to keep the Leader of the Opposition's commitment to the Australian people that Work Choices is dead. - Work Choices is alive and well in the Liberal Party. We have seen it on display today. There is nowhere to run now, nowhere to hide. We will be seeing how they vote in this parliamentary fortnight, but the Australian people should know they are the party of Work Choices still.</DOC>

 - I thank the former minister for Work Choices for his question, because there is no doubt that if the government had not taken action last year with the Economic Security Strategy things would have been far worse in the national accounts. Might I add, that is something which is accepted by Westpac in their analysis. Also, the figures show this quite strongly, because if you have a look at consumption in the December quarterly accounts and compare it here to the rest of the world you can see straightaway how strong, on a comparative basis, consumption was in this country.Those opposite are continuing to play this silly political game. The first part of it is that we should not engage in any economic stimulus to support jobs. They have this proposition that Australia should simply sit and wait and see as a global recession rolls over the country. That is the proposition that those opposite are putting. This government has the view that it will do everything it responsibly can to support employment, to support business and to support demand in our economy at a time when global demand is collapsing.Just take the World Bank report yesterday. The World Bank report yesterday talked about the sharpest contraction since World War II and it pointed to trade figures that showed the worst outcome in 80 years. On the face of that, this government moved decisively last December, and all of the evidence in the national accounts points to the fact that we strengthened demand in the economy and we supported employment. This is a bit embarrassing for those opposite because every major employer in the retail industry says that it did but the opposition think they know better. In fact, when you listen to them dismiss the retail sales figures from December and January, you get the impression that they do not think there are many people employed in retail. There are something like 1.5 million Australians employed in retail. So in the December quarter Australia had a positive outcome for consumption, when right around the world it was collapsing._ bizarre to see spending on motor vehicles; clothing; leisure; restaurants/hotels; and alcohol/cigarettes all falling in the quarter. - This is a swiftie from Joe. He just likes to fiddle the figures. - Joe knows full well that -  - This is another swiftie from those opposite, because in the month of December retail sales rose. Why was that? Why would they have risen so sharply in December? Well, they rose because of the economic stimulus package. But the shadow Treasurer seeks to quote the quarterly figure from the national accounts so he can conveniently ignore the impact of the economic stimulus package. Of course, in the month of December we had a very substantial increase in retail sales, 3.8 per cent - now listen to this: the highest in eight years. Why would that have been the case? It was the case because of the economic stimulus package. Also, we had a further increase in retail sales of 0.2 per cent in January. Why was that? It was the economic stimulus package. That is why Gerry Harvey, Roger Corbett and all of the other major employers out there are saying the economic stimulus package has been a substantial boost to demand and a substantial support to employment.What happened elsewhere in the world during this period? In the US, retail sales fell by around three per cent in the month of December. In Japan, sales fell by two per cent in December. And of course what happened in Australia? Sales were up 3.8 per cent. So the figures show unambiguously that the Economic Security Strategy supported employment and supported jobs in the month of December - and of course those opposite just simply want to sit and wait and see. We on this side of the House will do everything within our power to support employment, to support demand and to support the Australian economy, and it is a pity those opposite would not do the same.</DOC>

She understands that around 43,000 pensioners, carers and families received Economic Security Strategy payments in her electorate of Kingston, and of course those payments were very important to supporting jobs in her community. Unlike those opposite, she understands that families, pensioners, carers and people with disabilities are doing it very, very tough in these economic times. We have provided considerable support to those people through our economic strategy payments in December last year and from this week we will be going further with our Nation Building and Jobs Plan.In fact, in December four million pensioners and 1.9 million families benefited; they got some extra help from the Economic Security Strategy payments. The payments got a big tick from a wide range of different organisations - the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group through to National Seniors, Carers Australia and the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations. All of these national organisations supported the government's Economic Security Strategy payments. One organisation did not - of course, those sitting opposite. We all remember the excruciating period the Leader of the Opposition took the Liberal and National parties through. They could not decide what their position was; they flip-flopped all over the place. Of course, at first they supported the payments; at first they supported the package. Then they said they wanted to change them, then they did not support the package, then they voted for the package, and now here we are three months later and they are wishing that they had not supported the package. The Leader of the Opposition is now saying he wishes that all of those people, 1.9 million Australian families and four million pensioners, had not received those Economic Security Strategy payments - quite remarkable when you consider what happened with the December retail figures, which demonstrated the biggest monthly increase since August 2000. As the Australian Retailers Association said:_ the Rudd government has done its job with the $10.4 billion stimulus package _But according to the Leader of the Opposition, the Retailers Association are wrong. In his desperation - you can only call it desperation - to score a political point, the Leader of the Opposition is trashing his economic credibility and also trashing his moral credibility by no longer supporting these payments to Australian pensioners and families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. He is right to point to data out today from Dun &amp; Bradstreet; from Sensis, on small and medium business enterprises; and the ANZ job ads survey. All of these point to the bad economic data on the jobs front and on the confidence front, and this is a reflection of the international economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. Also, I draw the honourable member's attention to the report referred to earlier by the Treasurer - that is, the report released over the weekend by the World Bank. The World Bank report said that the global GDP this year will decline for the first time since World War II. The World Bank went on to say that world trade is likely to register its largest decline in 80 years. This will be the first time that there has been an annual decline in world trade since 1982. Furthermore, the World Bank predicts that developing countries will face a financing gap of between $270 billion and $700 billion as a result of the crisis, which now engulfs the developing world as well. Also, I draw the honourable member's attention to the data which was produced over the last several days in the United States. The US Bureau of Labour Statistics announced that 651,000 Americans lost their jobs in February and US unemployment climbed to a 25-year high of 8.1 per cent.These are the global circumstances within which Australia currently operates, and these are difficult times for all governments. The alternatives presenting themselves to governments around the world are stark and clear: either you sit and do nothing and allow people to fend for themselves - which is, at its essence, what those opposite recommend - or you take action. This government has a plan of action. We will provide stability to the Australian financial sector, for the first time in Australia's history providing a guarantee for bank deposits for Australian deposit holders. Secondly, we will provide short-term stimulus measures to provide necessary payments to support pensioners, carers, veterans, farmers and others in order to provide support to the retail sector in particular - and the statistics for December and January have just been referred to by the Treasurer. We will also provide payments to first home buyers. The honourable member asked a question about what actions the government have taken which have resulted in impacts on employment. One of the specific measures announced last October as part of that economic strategy, which the Liberal Party supported at the time, was the trebling of the first home buyers bonus.Could I draw the honourable member's attention to the following figures. New Treasury figures, recently released, show that nearly 30,000 Australians received the government's first home owners boost in its first 3½ months of operation - 10,000-plus in New South Wales, nearly 6,000 in Victoria, 6½ thousand in Queensland, nearly 3,000 in Western Australia and 2,400 in South Australia. Is the shadow Treasurer saying he wishes those payments had not been made to those first home buyers? That is the absolute logic of his position because he, through his leader, supported those measures last year.I refer the shadow Treasurer to the following statements. In Sydney's south-west, the Cornish Group sold 70 per cent of its 53 sales at the Spring Farm estate in Camden to first home buyers. Chris Lamont, from the Housing Industry Association, said were it not for the first home owner boost, a lot more people in the building industry would be out of work. Furthermore, Michael Cant, of the Commonwealth Bank, said: 'We've had to put on more staff and we've been looking to increase staffing levels through temps and contractors to deal with the bank's response to the extra applications which have come in from first home buyers.' Furthermore, if you look at the ABS figures for the period in question, you will see that the number of first home buyers increased by 17.8 per cent, pushing their share of loans to 23.6 per cent - the highest since January 2002. The number of new houses purchased by first home buyers jumped by almost 10 per cent.The shadow Treasurer asked the question: where is the evidence that the measures taken last October have had effect? I have demonstrated - through figures from the ABS and through statements by responsible bank representatives and by corporate leaders - what that effect has been. It is quite plain that those opposite, when confronted with the global economic crisis that we are dealing with, have this as their response: the government is embarked upon an economic strategy to see Australia through the crisis; the Liberal Party is embarked upon a political strategy to take advantage from the crisis. That is the difference.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. This is a government that believes in nation building. That is why we brought forward $560 million in our first budget to bring forward 30 separate road projects. That is why we have established the Community Infrastructure Fund, with $800 million in it, to create jobs and stimulate local economies around the nation. That is why in December we delivered a $4.7 billion nation-building package, including $1.2 billion for 17 rail projects and $711 million to bring forward national road projects. That is why we doubled the funding for the Black Spot Program. In February, of course, we brought forward the Nation Building and Jobs Plan - some $42 billion.The Leader of the Opposition says, 'We believe in investment in infrastructure.' That is what they say. But you have to look at what they actually do, not what they say. While Malcolm thinks he is in the middle, he is really just in a muddle. When you look at each of -  - I will. But the Leader of the Opposition is indeed in a muddle, because he says that he supports pension increases but then he says that they are bad, that they should not have happened. He says that he opposes Work Choices but then, even today, we cannot get a decision on whether the opposition will vote for or against the legislation. He says that he is in favour of infrastructure and nation building. Well, every chance that he gets, he votes against it. He voted against the $14.7 billion to modernise our schools. He voted against the $6.4 billion on public and community housing. He voted against the $800 million for community infrastructure. He voted against $150 million for boom gates on rail crossings. He voted against $150 million extra for road maintenance. He voted against $90 million extra for black spots. The opposition voted against the legislation to establish the three nation-building funds, with $26 billion in them. During the Senate vote, of course, we witnessed some splitting and voting three ways, perhaps a precursor of things to come on the Work Choices legislation. The opposition split three ways. Some voted in favour, some voted against and some just had a dunny break - could not be bothered voting at all. But we should not be surprised, because, if we look at what they actually did in office, in road funding they slashed it, in their last year in office, from $4.3 billion to $2.8 billion.But I am pleased to say that we are getting on with the job of nation building, and now every state and territory government has signed up to the $26.4 billion nation-building plan. Queensland, because of the caretaker period, are not able to sign at this stage, but the Queensland government have said that they will sign. The opposition leader up in Queensland, last Tuesday, said that he would sign up to the Rudd government's offer of a $6.5 billion road and rail package for Queensland. I thought, 'There's an opposition leader who actually understands nation building.' But the commitment only lasted two days, because two days later, on the Thursday, whether at the suggestion of the federal Leader of the Opposition or the Queensland Liberals or Nationals or Liberal-Nationals - whatever they are here in Canberra - he decided that they wanted the same deal that they were offered by the Howard government. Well, I have got news for Mr Springborg, because the deal that we are offering Queensland is double what was offered by the Howard government under AusLink over the same period of time. If you compare the nation-building program with AusLink, we have doubled the funding. It does say something quite extraordinary that you have an opposition leader campaigning in the Queensland election who is actually asking for less money from the Commonwealth.We will get on with the job of nation building. Those opposite, when it comes to infrastructure, have no idea. We are building pipelines; they just offer pipe dreams. They do not believe in nation building; they do not believe in infrastructure. All you have to do is look at their voting pattern to see that that is the case.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. He asked me also about Dun &amp; Bradstreet before. He forgot to mention that they said that this is a demonstration that not only has the federal government's stimulus package been necessary but more will be required before the end of 2009. I notice the member for North Sydney did not actually add that bit in his reference to the Dun &amp; Bradstreet release.The member for North Sydney refers to the global economy. I would have thought that, as someone who himself has worked in financial markets before, he would understand the impact of global financial markets on the Australian economy. I would also have thought that the honourable member would understand that, if you have a problem in the supply of global credit to the Australian economy, it has a direct impact on the flow of credit to households and to businesses and to small businesses. - I would have thought that the member for North Sydney, given his background in the financial services industry, would understand the flow-through impact of global credit supply on Australian financial institutions and Australian firms, large and small, and the impact, in turn, on employment. That is why the government, including the Treasurer, me and others, are directly engaged with other heads of government in the G20 in order to advance proposals to deal with the challenge which all global banks are now confronted with, including the particular problem which those large banks in the United States and the United Kingdom currently confront in terms of the state of their balance sheets.The member for North Sydney knows full well that until that problem is effectively dealt with, we have a huge problem on our hands in terms of the global economy. The member for North Sydney may find this terribly amusing, but I think all seriously minded members of this House would understand that in the midst of a global economic recession, which has come off the back of a global financial crisis that came off the back of the state of the world's global banks, we must also go back to the cause of the problem. That is what the government is dealing with.What we are also dealing with in the meantime is sorting out what measures can be deployed responsibly within Australia to cushion the impact of the global economic recession on Australia. That is why we have advanced our policy to stabilise domestic financial markets by providing guarantees for every Australian deposit holder. That is why we have also advanced our proposals to provide short-term stimulus through payments to pensioners, to veterans, to carers and to first home buyers. That is why the government is in the business of supporting longer term stimulus by embracing Australia's single biggest school modernisation program, embracing the biggest single injection into social housing that this country has seen - that is, 20,000 units - and investing in energy efficiency measures with the objective of ensuring that owner-occupied dwellings in Australia - all of them - have ceiling insulation by the time that that program has concluded.What do these measures do? They stimulate jobs at the local level, they provide benefits by way of infrastructure for the long term and, in the case of the energy efficiency measure, they also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We have a strategy and a plan to steer Australia through the crisis. The alternative is the opposition's approach, which is not to advance a serious economic alternative but to seek to turn everything to their political advantage. That is the simple contrast here. I say to those opposite that their approach of sitting back and waiting - of doing nothing - and then simply carping and criticising whatever the government does on the positive agenda is, frankly, ultimately unsustainable if they want to advance any credentials whatsoever or to be taken seriously in the Australian body politic at present.We are faced with a serious crisis. The government in its arsenal does not have a silver bullet. We have said repeatedly that our objective is to cushion the impact of this crisis on Australian families and jobs. That is a responsible course of action; it is a strategy that we believe can see Australia through this crisis, and it stands in stark contrast with the absence of any strategy whatsoever on the part of those opposite.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Blaxland for his question. He held a housing affordability forum in his electorate at the beginning of last year and the main issue that was discussed that night was the extraordinary number of repossessions that were occurring in his electorate. People sought advice on how to avoid -  - that serious issue. That was a terrific interjection from the other side! These repossessions actually started under your government. - The news today is that repossessions under Labor are down. - Repossessions in Blaxland have gone from 60 in August last year to 20 last month, and house sales are up. Half of those purchases are going to first home buyers. Why is that? It is because of the Economic Security Strategy - the measures that we introduced - and because of the early and decisive action taken last year by the Rudd government to respond to the global financial crisis.What we have seen around the world in comparable countries, like the UK and the US, is very serious conditions in their housing markets. We have seen people losing their homes, we have seen builders going bust at a very high rate and, of course, increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness. In contrast, here, as the Prime Minister pointed out, over 30,000 first home buyers have taken advantage of the first home owner boost in the first 3½ months of its operation. We have seen reports of this from right around the country. Today's Advertiser reports record numbers of first home owners grants being funded in South Australia, especially in new developments in northern suburbs like Paralowie and Salisbury. In Victoria, the Herald-Sun reports:Home ownership for many is at present a realistic achievement.The Sunday Mail in Brisbane reported on the weekend that many regional centres and northern cities recorded surprisingly strong growth as people took advantage of the first home buyer grant, falling interest rates and stamp duty exemptions.Of course, it is not just the tradies and apprentices who are benefiting from this increased activity and confidence from first home buyers. As the Prime Minister said, in the banking sector we are also hearing of people being put on by the banks, including the Commonwealth Bank, because of the increased demands for processing new loans. The opposition spokesman, who voted against extra spending for social and Defence housing in the National Building and Jobs Plan, keeps asking what the government is doing for the private housing market, in contrast to public and Defence housing. That reminds me a little of the Monty Python sketch What have the Romans ever done for us. The first home owner boost is directly stimulating activity in the construction sector and related fields and it is supporting jobs in small businesses right across the country. We have lending data that shows that and we have the data from the home owner boost figures. We have evidence from builders and developers right across the country that shows that.Before the first home owner boost, we already saw work start and the first families move into our National Rental Affordability Scheme rental properties. We saw projects announced right across Australia through the Housing Affordability Fund to directly bring down the cost of 14,000 homes and indirectly support lower costs for around another 300,000 homes. We are helping young people who are not yet in a position to buy to set up first home saver accounts. And, of course, that $6.6 billion of spending on social and Defence housing that the opposition voted against will employ tradies and apprentices right across Australia. I met some of them in Glebe yesterday and I can tell you that they are very grateful for the work.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. All I can say is that we can say to the Australian people that, in the middle of a global recession, we have done everything we possibly can to support employment in the Australian economy. I can say that truthfully and I can say that while I look them straight in the eye. Those opposite cannot answer that question, because they have not been in favour of one single measure which has supported employment in the Australian economy in the last 12 months. Their solution is to sit, to wait and to see, as the global recession washes its way through this country. We will do everything within our power through economic stimulus, through stabilisation of the financial -  - The assertion by the shadow Assistant Treasurer is just more game playing from those opposite to cover up their embarrassment for the fact that they do not have an alternative policy proposition to put to the Australian people about supporting employment and supporting Australian business. We do. We have specific propositions that we have put forward through our Economic Security Strategy and also through our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. We just heard from the Minister for Housing the impact that the first home owner boost is having out there right now on jobs in the Australian economy - a measure which those opposite do not support. So we can subtract all of those jobs that have been created in the first home owners grant flow-through - we can subtract all of those from any record they might have had. What we are getting here is the fact that those opposite do not have a policy alternative. We do. - It is called an Economic Security Strategy, a Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which will support employment in the Australian economy. The opposition have no plan for the future; they simply have a plan for finding fault. We on this side of the House have a positive alternative, and we will continue to support Australian business and Australian jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Some 325,000-plus Veterans' Affairs pensioners received the one-off payment of $1,400 for singles, and $2,100 for couples, last December. That covered over 100,000 veteran service pensioners, over 90,000 partner service pensioners and over 105,000 war widows. It was a spend of some $400 million, a spend aimed at the vulnerable in our community, a spend aimed at those in the veterans community who have done the hard yards for our country at a time when our country needed it.There has been an overwhelmingly positive response to these payments within the veterans community. When I have been out and about and also when I have received correspondence, it has been very clear that these payments have been welcome at a time when veterans have really needed them. There is absolutely no doubt about that. There is also plenty of anecdotal evidence of the fact that the money is being spent on the sorts of things that will boost the economy. I will give some examples of the comments that I have received. A veteran from Tuross Head said:We extend our best wishes that Australia will be able to ride out the storm during this difficult financial situation and that your government can continue its plans for the future.A veteran from the seat of Bendigo said:This payment will be most welcome during these uncertain economic times.And from a constituent in Brighton, in the electorate of Goldstein:The overall action by your government in these uncertain times is very much appreciated, I am sure, by all concerned.Well, actually, not quite by all concerned - not by his local member, not by the Leader of the Opposition, not by those on that side of the chamber. There is no doubt that this stimulus package has provided support to those who really need it, and there is no doubt it has actually ameliorated the sorts of impacts that our economy is facing in the current circumstances. Yet the opposition still oppose it or, rather, they jump from one side to the other. The Leader of the Opposition says to the Australian people that he has a plan, a strategy, and that he is a decisive leader. The only thing he is really decisive about is changing his mind. They vote for the package, then they oppose the package. They talk up the economy while, at the same time, they talk down the economy. That is the way they are approaching this debate and the way they approach the current economic situation. There is no doubt that this package has been well received. There is no doubt that it is supported in the general community and there is no doubt that the opposition have to work out what they are really doing on these issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the 'shadow minister for Work Choices' for his question. I do find myself with some sympathy for his position, because clearly he has been instructed by those around him to go out and defend Work Choices -  -  - Amidst all the embarrassment amongst the Liberal Party members about references to Work Choices, can I say the following to the shadow minister: I do have some sympathy for his predicament. He has obviously been instructed to go out and cover up the fact that the position of the Liberal Party is Work Choices and always will be. - As I was saying, I understand the difficulties confronting the shadow minister for whatever their policy is at the moment, but I can give the shadow minister a very clear guarantee. My very clear guarantee to the shadow minister is as follows: the Fair Work Bill offers workers greater job security than Work Choices, which was purpose designed to make it easier to sack employees and to enable their redundancy to be stripped away without a cent of compensation. What that means is that the Liberal Party, as the party of Work Choices, stand also as the party of job insecurity, because you believe that it is fair for workers to be sacked for no reason at all. - The guarantee is that the Fair Work Bill is better for job security than Work Choices, which allowed people to be sacked for no reason. The other thing that I can absolutely guarantee to the member asking the question is that this is a government that is going to be honest with people about the economic circumstances confronting this nation. In terms of those economic circumstances, we have been clear with people that the global financial crisis and global recession are going to impact on employment in this country. - I was saying that this is a government that will be honest with the Australian people about the outlook for employment. We are being honest with the Australian people about the global financial crisis and the global recession and the fact that our economy is not immune. What the Liberal Party are engaged in here is just a sleight of hand - the sleight of hand that they played every day up till the last election, where they said to the Australian people that Work Choices equal jobs growth and they forgot to mention the resources boom. Now, of course, desperately twisting and turning to justify their support for Work Choices, they are going to pretend that there is not a global financial crisis. Well, this is cheap -  - I had intended to conclude, but -  -  - Mr Speaker, can I conclude by saying this: these are difficult economic days. The Australian people - The member for Swan then left the chamber. - In conclusion, these are difficult days, and in these difficult days the government is investing in our economy and supporting jobs, something opposed every step of the way by the Liberal Party. Can I say to the Liberal Party: if you want to stand for Work Choices, have the honesty to just say it; do not feign an interest in Australian jobs when you voted against a $42 billion plan to support those jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. I know that she, amongst many members on this side of the House, is very concerned about binge drinking in her own electorate and would be pleased to know that the government acted in the last sitting week and was able to pass in this House the measure to end the tax break for alcopops. Of course, we believe this was a victory for common sense. We hope that such common sense will also prevail in the Senate in the coming fortnight. We believe that when multinational companies specifically design their products to target underage drinkers they should not be rewarded with a tax break. I have to say I am constantly amazed that the Liberal Party, on the other side of the House, seem to think otherwise. I am equally amazed that the Liberal Party are determined to give $260 million-plus back to the distillers if they refuse to pass this measure in the Senate. - It seems that the shadow minister is determined to disagree with this. I would draw his attention and that of those opposite to the evidence given by the tax office at Senate estimates recently when the second commissioner was asked specifically this question: what would happen if the bill was blocked? I will read this particularly for the member for Dickson, who seems determined to ignore this very basic advice that has been given. The second commissioner replied to a question from a senator:Basically, Senator, the situation is that if it comes to pass then we would need to refund the excise, and that would be given to the manufacturers.There it is in black and white - the Liberal Party, if they refuse to support this measure, will be delivering hundreds of millions of dollars back to the manufacturers for this amount of money. Given that we have seen the success of this measure so far, I think the evidence is becoming clearer and clearer that this measure is deserving of support. AC Nielsen figures, the figures that those opposite regularly rely on, reported a few days ago in the Sydney Morning Herald, showed that overall alcohol sales have fallen by 124 million standard drinks. This is across all types of alcohol. On Sunday the Australian Drug Foundation published figures showing that sales of alcopops have fallen by 310 million standard drinks. And of course we have the tax office figures that show that to the end of January sales of alcopops have slumped 35 per cent while overall spirit sales have fallen by almost eight per cent - far better than our original predictions.So it is no surprise that health experts overwhelmingly support action taken by this side of the House to close this loophole. Last week a group of 20 health experts took out a half-page ad in the Australian arguing for this measure to be kept. They said, amongst other things:We trust the Senate can put aside political differences and vote on the basis of sound research evidence, rather than liquor industry propaganda.Two weeks ago a study was published by health experts in the Medical Journal of Australia arguing that the tax was working. And I might draw the House's attention to evidence given today in the Senate inquiry by the president of the AMA, Dr Rosanna Capolingua, who supported the government's actions and said:The AMA would see it as a retrograde step if the alcopops tax did not go through.The Australian Drug Foundation said:The Senate must ensure that alcopops are not sold at pocket money prices.So we are getting clearer and clearer evidence here that is backing this measure. We have stronger and stronger support from public health advocates, from doctors, from researchers.The only people who still oppose this measure are the distillers and the Liberal Party. It seems that these two groups get along very well together. In fact, people on this side of the House would remember that we voted on the alcopops legislation quite late one night last sitting week. As we all left the chamber, who should I run straight into but Mr Gordon Broderick, the executive director of the Distilled Spirits Industry Council, and who was he talking to? It was the member for Dickson, already huddled in a corner the instant we got out of here, getting a good pat on the head like a good schoolboy for having voted against this measure. It is about time he started listening to the real evidence, not just the advice of the distillers, and he should draw the line at giving hundreds of millions of dollars back to them even if he gets a pat on the head for voting against it.</DOC>

Those figures are there for all to see. The honourable member will know therefore that we are in the midst of the jobs consequence flowing from the global economic recession -  -  - And what people want to know is whether they have redundancy protection through it as opposed to redundancy arrangements stripped away from it, as each of those members opposite secured when they voted for the passage of Work Choices.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page and acknowledge her strong engagement with the farmers in her electorate, including the banana growers in Page. On 3 March the Director of Quarantine issued a new determination on the importation of bananas from the Philippines. This determination had been reviewed by the Eminent Scientists Group and the independent Import Risk Analysis Appeals Panel. The strict rules involve registration of low-risk plantations, disinfection and fungicide spraying and audit and verification by Australian inspectors, the cost of which will be paid for by the Philippines. I note the strong representations made by the Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, on behalf of growers, both to me and directly to the Prime Minister as well.Honourable members should be aware of the furious response that this has received from the Philippines. Filipino growers have been extraordinarily angry at this decision, on the basis that they believe these rules will actually prevent Filipino bananas from being able to enter Australia. I quote from the Manila Standard, where the head of the Bureau of Plant Industry made the comment that these restrictions were 'very stringent, expensive and trade restrictive'. In the same way, the agricultural undersecretary has made the comment that 'if the conditions are that strict, no industry can profit through exports'.But it has not only been the international reaction. There was also the reaction that appeared in the Coffs Coast Advocate yesterday, where the Leader of the Nationals, on a visit to Coffs Harbour, made these comments:I'm staggered the Government has decided to import _ I always held the view that the bananas would never be allowed into the country.The reason that was so surprising was that it was not the first time he has gone to Coffs Harbour to make a comment on bananas. On 3 July 2000, the Leader of the Nationals -  -  - And they say, 'Why nine years ago?' I will tell you why - because nine years ago he, as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, initiated the import risk assessment on bananas for importation from the Philippines. He released the media release from Coffs Harbour - the same place - where he said:As is the usual practice, the banana IRA will be conducted _ allowing a careful scientific assessment of the quarantine risks as well as opportunities for widespread consultation with all stakeholders.But that was not enough. Two years later, as minister for agriculture, he again made the comment:Neither threats of trade retaliation by the Philippines or publicity campaigns by the Australian industry will be taken into account in the decision.What is more, Biosecurity Australia, as an entity, was instituted and the legislation went through while he was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I table the media releases. As far as the process which has led to this is concerned, the Leader of the National Party designed it, initiated it and defended it. And yet today he is wandering around saying, 'Oh, I wonder how this happened.' Only in the National Party would you find a leader who actually wants you to believe that he was asleep at the wheel, because at least that is less embarrassing than the truth. Current indications are that no Filipino bananas are likely to come into Australia, but, if any were to come here, they may as well carry the label 'Grown in the Philippines, brought to you by the Queensland National Party'.</DOC>

 - It must have been a rough time indeed yesterday in the Liberal Party party room. The Leader of the Opposition raises a question which goes to the link between the government's economic stimulus strategy on the one hand and employment and jobs on the other. The question, in particular, that he raises is the extent to which our provision of payments to pensioners and to carers and our provision of support to first home buyers have a material effect on the economy and jobs. Obviously the Leader of the Opposition, in his search for evidence, has not gone to today's housing finance data, produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Let me read this to him, because it goes directly to a key element of the economic stimulus strategy which he raises in his question and which was supported by him then and opposed by him subsequently. What we see today from this data is that the ABS shows that the proportion of first home buyers seeking finance approvals has jumped to 26.5 per cent. This is the highest proportion since the series began in 1991. Let me quote Joshua Williams, the economist of TD Securities, who says:The increase in housing finance numbers in January for owner-occupiers was the fourth consecutive monthly increase and suggests that the cumulative falls in mortgage interest rates and increase to the first home owners grant have been successful in luring more potential buyers out of the woodwork.I would also draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the following: the number of owner-occupied housing finance commitments increased by 3.5 per cent in January after increasing by 6.7 per cent in December. - The Leader of the Opposition asked a question about the impact of the Economic Security Strategy which we launched last October, and he asked for the evidentiary link between it on the one hand and employment on the other. That is precisely what the Leader of the Opposition had contained within his question. I provided an answer which he is uncomfortable with, as it is based on fact. - The package which the Leader of the Opposition is attacking was a threefold increase in the first home owners grant, which was part of the package introduced by the government in October called the economic stimulus strategy. That is the package which the Leader of the Opposition has attacked repeatedly in the House. - Oh, he now makes a distinction for that aspect of the economic stimulus strategy which he, having supported it, then opposed but is back to supporting. So is the Leader of the Opposition now saying he supports the trebling of the first home owners grant? Is that what the Leader of the Opposition is saying? - I think the Leader of the Opposition -  - So the spending therefore undertaken by first home buyers in terms of their decision to take the threefold increase in the first home owners grant and go out there and spend their money on a new house is demonstrated in the figures which have been released today through the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Therefore we have the number of owner-occupied housing finance commitments increased by 3.5 per cent in January. The value of housing finance commitments increased by 0.7 per cent in January. The value of owner-occupied housing finance increased by 2.3 per cent. The proportion of first home buyers seeking approvals jumped to 26.5 per cent. Owner-occupied commitments for the construction of new homes rose 2.5 per cent in January, following a 10.4 per cent increase in December. I would draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to these core facts. He attacks the economic stimulus strategy launched by the government. A core component of that strategy dealt with the direct cash support to first home buyers to encourage them to go out and buy a new home. The data today demonstrates that is what they have been doing. The reason he doth protest so much is that he knows the data undermines his entire argument.</DOC>

 - I would draw the attention of members of the House to a statement overnight from the director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, which reported the sobering news that the IMF is further revising down its global growth forecast for 2009. Mr Strauss-Kahn has said that growth in 2009 is now predicted to be less than zero for the first time in the IMF's history. He said:The IMF expects global growth to slow below zero this year, the worst performance in most of our lifetimes.He goes on to note that the global financial crisis might now be called the great recession. This sobering report from the director of the IMF follows the report in the last 24 to 48 hours of the head of the World Bank and the World Bank itself also predicting that global economic growth in 2009 would, in fact, go below zero.These two sobering reports on the state of the global economy remind us of the dimensions of the challenge with which Australia is presented by the global economic recession. Again, it is like a global economic cyclone approaching this country. It started in America. It has come through Europe and it is now affecting all economies around the world - a synchronised global economic downturn with all countries and all sectors within those economies being hit at the same time.Those opposite may argue that it is within the power of any single national government to prevent a cyclone from crossing your shores. You cannot give that undertaking. What you can do, however, is take prudent action to reduce the damage, to reduce the impact of that cyclone on Australia. That is what we have done through the government's economic stimulus strategy. The alternative, argued by those opposite, is to do nothing and therefore expose all Australian families to the full force of the storm. That is the difference. We say we can cushion the impact of the storm. Those opposite say: 'You're on your own. Look after yourselves. Look after your own circumstances. You're on your own.' In fact it entirely underlines their philosophy in industrial relations as well: go out there and fend for yourself. It is the law of the jungle.The government's Economic Security Strategy hinges on three core components. First is the stabilisation of financial markets, the cornerstone of which is the provision of a government guarantee for all Australian deposit holders for the first time in Australia's history not just as a necessary ingredient for stability in financial markets but, on top of that, as a necessary ingredient for confidence in the economy as well. Then there is short-term stimulus, which has been the subject of questions already by the Leader of the Opposition - providing payments to families, payments to pensioners, payments to carers, payments to veterans, payments to farmers, payments in order to provide support to Australians who are under stress and challenge because of the impact of the global economic recession; but at the same time providing support to employment in the Australian economy in the consumption sector of the economy, in retail, which employs 1½ million Australians. Thirdly, there is long-term stimulus as well: Investing in our Schools, the biggest school modernisation program in Australia's history; investing in 20,000 new units of social housing; and investing in energy efficiency to ensure over time that we have ceiling insulation in every single Australian owner-occupied home right across the country, bringing down greenhouse gas emissions but also stimulating the local economy. Together with investments in roads, rail and ports, this is long-term infrastructure which comes off the back of necessary stimulus also in the short term.As part of the its economic stimulus strategy, the government today will start making the payments of $950 back-to-school bonuses and $900 single-income family bonuses to help support families through the global economic recession and at the same time support jobs in the Australian retail sector, a sector which employs 1½ million Australians. I note that a report today by Access Economics notes that 53c in the dollar of the stimulus will be outlayed in 2009, with 74 cents to be outlayed by mid-2010. Access goes on to say:Australia's stimulus may be a smaller share of our national income than the United States equivalent but it has the potential to do more in the short term.Access goes on to say:History may mark the first week of February in 2009 as an important building block in Australia's eventual economic recovery. Tuesday, February 3 saw a big interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank and an even bigger stimulus package from the federal government. Both these measures will lift the spending power of households through 2009 providing important support for retailers against the tide of rising unemployment and consumer caution.Those are comments from Access Economics in their report today.It is not just institutions like Access which have spoken in support of the government's economic stimulus strategy. We also have statements from other organisations, including the National Farmers Federation. The National Farmers Federation stated:The government's $950 tax-free bonus for all drought affected farmers - reaching some 21,500 farmers in need - will be a much-needed fillip to families and regional economies. - What I have been referring to is the state of the global economic recession; its impact on Australia; the alternative strategies, such as 'do nothing', recommended by those opposite; our economic stimulus strategy and the elements of it, together with the new measure which is being delivered today; and those which support that approach. What surprises me most on the part of those opposite - and I see the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry nodding in this direction - is: how could the National Party stand in this place and vote against a $950 payment to drought affected farmers?How could the member for Wide Bay sit there - as he avoids my gaze - and vote against a $950 payment to drought affected farmers? How could the members of the National Party up there -  - How could you, Paul, vote against a $950 payment to drought affected farmers? What has happened to the National Party of old standing up for people in the bush and standing up for those who are droughted - except in this case, because the politics of this overall debate do not suit them. Once again they have tapped the mat, yielded to the Liberal Party and said, 'No, we are going to stand opposed to a payment to 21½ thousand drought affected farmers.' Well, we on this side of the House say to you over there in cocky corner, 'Shame, shame, shame.'If you go to the other elements of the government's strategy, it is not just short-term economic stimulus -  - The nation-building plan which the government has announced, and the economic stimulus strategy which the government is implementing, are each designed to provide support for jobs and to build long-term infrastructure. In the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, for every dollar of short-term stimulus that we provide by way of payments to -  - I think what is provocative for the opposition is what the National Farmers Federation says: that the government's $950 tax-free bonus for all drought affected farmers - Opposition members - Boring! - That bonus, that is reaching some 21½ thousand farmers in need, and which those opposite say is boring, will be a much-needed fillip to families and the regional economy. I do not think that drought affected farmers would find it that way. The reason those opposite find it so provocative is that every significant peak industry organisation in Australia is getting behind what the government is trying to do to provide extra stimulus to the economy. -  again. Come on down the front, Pete, because I gather that is where you were yesterday in the party room. Come on down the front - in that seat or that one, I am not sure -  -  - Yes, well, it was an interesting exchange, I understand, in the Liberal Party party room in terms of whose idea their most recent -  - I have particularly appreciated the member for Sturt's interjection, because I think we all know what happened in the Liberal Party party room yesterday because we all read this morning's papers. And we heard a number of them at the doors as well, but I am sure these will become subjects for debate by the end of the day. - The government's economic security strategy deals with short-term stimulus by way of payments to Australians who need support in order to boost employment in the retail sector, as well as investment in infrastructure and investment in housing in order to provide long-term support for our economy. Our overall approach to this is a clear-cut strategy for the future, and I would say to those opposite that it is about time that their approach to the global financial crisis was to engage in a serious economic strategy for the future rather than, as they are currently engaged in, a political strategy with one objective: to take as much political advantage as they can out of the economic crisis. Those opposite should get serious in contributing a positive idea for the debate. The nation expects it of you.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, because what I can guarantee to him is that Australians will not have redundancy payments stripped away from them. That is because we intend to produce fair industrial relations laws. The government's projections of unemployment are in the economic outlook. - Anyone who is concerned about unemployment in this country today is concerned about redundancy payments. What is the difference? We on this side of the House stand up for their rights to redundancy payments. Those who supported Work Choices want to strip them away. The government's position on future unemployment projections is contained in the government's economic outlook, published in February.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question because he is certainly very interested in these stimulus payments that are flowing through to families in his electorate, where many people will deeply appreciate the additional assistance that they are going to receive.Families around Australia will begin receiving bonuses of up to $950 as part of our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Over 1.2 million families across Australia receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A will begin receiving a back-to-school bonus of $950 for each eligible school-age child. That will certainly be very welcome by very many parents in this country, including those in the electorate of Dawson. This will assist something like 2.8 million school-age children with the costs of the 2009 academic year. And from today, over one million families who rely on one main income earner will also begin to receive the single-income family bonus of $900. All families eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part B when we announced the Nation Building and Jobs Plan will receive this bonus. The remaining Centrelink bonuses to eligible farmers and students, which the Prime Minister was talking about before, will begin to be paid on 24 March. And, of course, we have a tax bonus for 8.7 million working Australians, who will be paid from early April.These bonuses are a key part of our efforts to support jobs by strengthening demand in the economy so that companies can afford to keep on and employ workers because there is sufficient demand in the economy. These payments are not a substitute for other direct government investments. Something like well over two-thirds of our Nation Building and Jobs Plan constitutes investments in schools, roads and houses. But these payments are very important; they are our best way to support jobs and growth until these investments kick in later this year to further stimulate demand in our economy, given what is occurring in the international economy - that sharp contraction of demand. So we have a two-stage process: payments to families to boost demand right now, and investment which flows through the economy to leave a lasting benefit for the nation.This approach has been endorsed today by Access Economics, who have had this to say:These measures will lift the spending power of households through 2009, providing important support for retailers against the tide of rising unemployment and consumer caution.It is the case that businesses are doing it tough and, without these payments, things would of course be even tougher. Of course, that is why the business community is supporting these payments so strongly. You had Greg Smith, the Managing Director of Clive Peeters, say this in February in relation to the Economic Security Strategy:It was quite phenomenal, really. Our suppliers expected it to be an average Christmas but sales were so strong that it left the industry short of supply.This is boosting demand. You can see that in the consumer confidence figures today, you can see it in the retail sales figures in December and you can see it again in January. But this is a very important point: our main priority remains direct investment, which is why, for every dollar in cash payments, we are investing more than $2 in schools, roads and houses. That is an investment which is not supported by those opposite. They do not understand the importance, in the face of this global contraction, to support demand, to strengthen demand in our economy. It was not always the case that they had such an approach to this investment.Back in 2001 the member for Higgins had a lot to say about strengthening demand in the economy. He said this at the International Monetary Fund in 2001:We must consider the risks that entail from waiting for hard evidence of the magnitude of the global slowdown.He said:We are experiencing a synchronised slowdown for the first time since the early 1980s.And he went on to say this:Insufficiently vigorous policy may result in a deeper and longer global downturn.That is what the member for Higgins said in 2001. Of course, it is a different story in 2009.The case for investment now is clear. It is supported by the IMF; it is supported by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve; it is supported by business in this country. But it is not supported by the Liberal Party, whose only approach is to sit and to wait and to see. Of course, what that will do is impose costs on this country that we can ill afford. We on this side of the House understand the need to support demand and jobs in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - The member for North Sydney asked a question about the impact on the retail sector, and restaurants in particular. Can I simply say to the member for North Sydney: his entire political attack and his leader's attack on this government has focused expressly on consumption payments which we have made as a government to support retail, including the restaurant sector, to boost the 1½ million Australians employed within that sector. We have a course of action; you have a plan of opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. I know that he is deeply interested in ensuring that there is fairness in Australian workplaces and that there is an end to Work Choices. In the lead-up to the 2007 election, the Labor Party campaigned that if elected we would get rid of Work Choices and replace it with our Forward with Fairness plan, published in documents like this - this is the policy implementation plan - from August 2007. In these policies we promised two things very specifically. We said that every Australian worker would be able to rely on National Employment Standards and that those National Employment Standards would deal with redundancy - that is, that people would be able to get redundancy pay and no-one would be able to have that stripped away from them. Of course, one of the principal vices of Work Choices is that it meant that people could have their redundancy pay stripped away with not one cent of compensation. Very specifically in this document we said that we would institute an ability for good workers, people who have proved themselves, to make an unfair dismissal claim, and we said in our policy, very specifically in this document, that we would make special arrangements for businesses with fewer than 15 employees. Two promises, one on redundancy and one on unfair dismissal, are contained in the Fair Work Bill. This is a government that believes in making a promise and then delivering it.I am asked about any obstacles to the delivery of these promises. Mr Speaker, can I say that I thought last December that perhaps the Liberal Party had seen the light and would enable the government to deliver these promises. In particular, I remember reading the front page of my Australian newspaper on 13 December last year. I read these words:_ Labor took a proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to the election and won _ So we must respect that. 
A government member - Who said that? - Who did say that? I repeat:_ Labor took a proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to the election and won _ So we must respect that.The Leader of the Opposition said that, which just means it is even more amazing that the Liberal Party yesterday went to war in its party room on whether or not to continue to support Work Choices. And the Leader of the Opposition emerged from that war in the party room, the war of which there is a blow-by-blow description in today's newspapers, at war with himself, because, despite saying those words, of course now it is a claim of the Liberal Party that we should change our unfair dismissal laws in the Fair Work Bill to make it easier for workers to be sacked.They emerged from the war in the Liberal party room talking about amendments to the Fair Work Bill, but they studiously avoided answering the question: if their amendments are not accepted, what happens next? Do they vote for the Fair Work Bill or do they vote to keep Work Choices? Well, fortunately, there is one honest man in the Liberal Party. I know it is a controversial call and I apologise to my colleagues if I have got it wrong, but the one honest man in the Liberal Party is a senator for South Australia, Cory Bernardi - he writes a good newsletter, as I understand it. Today the one honest man in the Liberal Party, Cory Bernardi, said this: 'If we can't fix the legislation we are right to vote against it.'Well, when the Liberal Party emerged from its party room yesterday at war with itself and with no clear position about what it was going to do next, how is it that Senator Bernardi today can be so certain of what the Liberal strategy is? Maybe, just maybe, the Liberal strategy was worked out at La Rustica last night when the shadow Treasurer, the salesman for Work Choices, had dinner with the member for Higgins, the architect of Work Choices. Maybe the Work Choices strategy of the Liberal Party was worked out then, or just maybe they were having dinner to discuss their support for the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. I would ask him at some point to perhaps tell the House: when was it that the Liberal Party in government released economic modelling of Work Choices? When did that happen? - Thank you, Mr Speaker; and I am awaiting the next edition of Senator Bernardi's newsletter. But on another point, when was it that the Liberal Party in government released economic modelling of Work Choices? Oh, that is right; it did not! It did not release economic modelling of Work Choices. Now it is time that the shadow minister just came clean and admitted that all of this twisting and turning is to find an excuse to stay in the embrace of Work Choices and to vote for a continuation -  - I cannot wait till the member for O'Connor gets his turn to be Leader of the Opposition. They are going to be good days! On the shadow minister's question, can I also say to the shadow minister: if the shadow minister and his current leader and the member for Higgins and the member for O'Connor and whoever else seriously believe that Work Choices created jobs then they should have the political courage to come to the dispatch box and say that they still believe in it and they are voting for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The Rudd government are indeed delivering our $800 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, the largest local infrastructure program in Australia's history. We said it would support jobs, we said it would support local economies and we said it would make local communities even better places to live in. So it is no surprise that we have had mayors and community leaders, government members who voted for the package and Independent members who voted for the package lobbying for particular projects in their local community.But here today we have again heard the opposition say that the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan is a waste of money - that it will not create a single job and that it will not achieve anything in terms of stimulating the economy. Indeed, when members from that side of the House arrive in Canberra they are pretty consistent on this. The member for Gippsland went out on 26 February and held a little doorstop interview. There he attacked the package and called it a 'very low quality spend of taxpayers money'. That is pretty consistent with what we have heard today, yesterday and last week - and what we heard during the debate on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. But they are a bit different when it comes to their electorate. The very same member for Gippsland has written me a letter supporting a $3.25 million proposal from that very program. In this letter he says, and I quote accurately:In the context of the goals for your economic stimulus package, the project will be labour intensive and stimulate local jobs and the wider economy.You are right, Member for Gippsland; you are absolutely correct. He says one thing in Canberra and another thing in his electorate.But he is not alone. Stephen Parry, who I understand is a Liberal senator from Tasmania, has said the following about a project:Not only is it an environmental initiative but this project would have immediate benefits in addressing the global economic crisis by injecting funds into the municipality for the rollout of the infrastructure.But it is not just them - I have had letters from the member for Maranoa, the member for La Trobe, the member for Paterson, the member for Canning, the member for Tangney, the member for Bowman and the member for Bradfield. Some have got really carried away - the member for Wannon has written me three letters for three projects. He understands the reality, which is that the Nation Building and Jobs Plan is good for jobs and is good for local economies.Of course, you have to look at the detail of what they actually do rather than what they say, because they are pretty tricky. They are tricky when it comes to Work Choices, which they cannot break away from; they are tricky when it comes to climate change, where they say they want action but they oppose the CPRS; they were tricky when it came to saying all of last year that they wanted to give extra money to pensioners, but now they are out there bagging the December stimulus package and not associating it with the extra money that went to pensioners, carers and veterans. You have to actually look at what they do. We saw an example of it again today when we had two questions asked relating to the forum that I hold regularly with the member for North Sydney on the Steve Price program. On the first one they did not throw in a quote at all, so you know that that has no credibility. On the second one -  - And I will read it out. Steve Price said this, accurately:Well, the restaurant industry today is predicting 1,000 restaurants will close and 2½ thousand jobs will disappear if this becomes law.Then I went on to say:Well, they were all going to disappear over various other issues from time to time as well and _ it didn't happen.STEVE PRICE: Well, hang on. The restaurant industry is saying - ALBANESE: Well _STEVE PRICE: _ they are going to lose 1,000 restaurants and 2½ thousand workers.ALBANESE: Well, absolute nonsense. Absolute nonsense.STEVE PRICE: That's not going to happen?ALBANESE: We operated as a country, as a nation, with a fair industrial and balanced industrial relations system pre Work Choices for a century. In many of the IR issues we were ahead of the world. We operated fairly, people were employed and we have nothing to fear from a fair balance in the workplace.'We have nothing to fear from a fair balance in the workplace' - and indeed we don't, which is why the Australian people at the last election voted for a fair balance in the workplace.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the National Party's question goes to the policy position of the Obama administration on climate change. I would simply draw the Leader of the National Party's attention to one fact: the Obama administration has committed itself to introducing an emissions trading scheme as a cap and trade system. They have indicated that as their policy approach. We on this side of the House welcome the fact that now in America - one of the single largest emitting countries in the world - we have a government and an administration prepared to be part of the global climate change solution and not simply to be part of the global climate change problem.Our approach is always to be balanced and to ensure that our approach to emissions trading ensures that our economy and our jobs are looked after and that we do the right thing to ensure that the next generation of Australians have a planet and a country which can be comfortably and profitably inhabited given the impact of climate change on water, given the impact of climate change on drought, given the impact of climate change on natural disasters and given the impact of climate change on severe weather events. I would have thought that the Leader of the National Party would be seized of that as well as the importance of acting to preserve jobs and to support firms through the difficult challenges presented by the global economic recession. We on this side of the House welcome the fact that the administration of the United States of America is now signing up to be part of the global solution and is not being part of the problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. The government does face very big economic challenges and these have been underlined by the December quarter accounts figures, which show amongst other things a very big drop in business inventories and a very big increase in household savings, all of which suggest that there was a major shock to confidence in the quarter, particularly in October, and that is reflected in surveys of business and consumer confidence. The data also does give some indication of the early impact of the government's first stimulus package, but I would emphasise that that of course only impacted on the last three weeks of the 13 weeks of the quarter. That therefore means that much of the impact is now occurring and will continue to flow into the course of this year. I note that the data that shows the impact of the first home owners grant extension that the government determined last year adds to the evidence indicating that the decisions to stimulate activity taken by the government last year are beginning to have a significant effect. As always, the crucial question we have to ask here is: what would be happening were it not for that stimulus to the Australian economy?There are some arguing that we should be returning to the policy approaches of the recent past. The most prominent of these has of course been the member for Higgins, who has been haunting TV studios, hounding radio producers and chasing anybody who might be remotely connected with the media up hill and down dale, arguing that we should return to Work Choices, scrap any suggestion of a carbon pollution reduction scheme and restore the Howard government's economic policy generally. I note he is claiming credit for the fact that he made a statement in October 2007 suggesting that the Australian economy was soon to be hit by a tsunami coming from a collapse in the global economy. He is now claiming this as the basis for why he should be listened to as the great economic seer and the person who would lead us into the promised land.Like all soothsayers, astrologers, myth makers and snake-oil salesmen, the member for Higgins wants us to take note of some things that he said some time ago that vaguely turned out to be accurate and ignore some of the other things. I note that roughly at the same time he was also urging Australians to put their money into superannuation, up to $150,000 a year under his new tax-free rule. He said, 'Put all your money into superannuation.' There are now a lot of people out there regretting taking his advice, borrowing money in order to put money into superannuation. At the same time as he was purportedly telling people there was a huge tsunami on the way, he was telling people to put their money into superannuation. He is yearning for a return to the past - yearning for a return to Work Choices, inaction on climate change and inaction on infrastructure.I was on a TV program with the member for Higgins last week. He was asked why he was choosing to stay on the back bench. His answer was that it gives him time to reflect. How do you like that? That is the purpose of being in this parliament - reflection! It is kind of like this is an ashram or something where we all sit around and say 'om' and reflect, or an ashram in Armadale in the seat of Higgins with old Swami Costello and his acolytes reflecting on the state of the world. - My apologies, Mr Speaker. Sadly, every few weeks the media gets a little bit bored and out pops the member for Higgins - will he, won't he, what did he say in that phone call, who is he supporting in a preselection, who is running for the local council and where does he walk his dog? All that kind of stuff comes up. I am sorry to say this to the Liberal Party but this is all a waste of time. We know you are having great difficulty making up your mind on whether you want to go back to the past or not and whether you want to support Work Choices or not -  - The government does not believe that Australia should return to the recent past. In fact, our economic policy is focused on making up for the mistakes of the recent past, for 10 years of soft options, for 10 years of minimal economic reform, for 10 years of inadequate investment in infrastructure and skill, and with one big agenda at the end. The big agenda was to attack working people's rights in the workplace. We are also about restoring the rights of working people in the workplace. We are going to proceed with our reform agenda and we suggest that the member for Higgins gets out of the road of the Liberal Party getting with the strength and understanding that the Australian people are moving on from the Howard era. They have a very different agenda and a very different set of economic needs which this government is delivering.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. I cannot believe the hide of the shadow minister. They do not have a policy at all. We have a white paper, we have legislation in the parliament; they have no policy whatsoever. On 23 February the Leader of the Opposition said in the Australian that he stood for deeper cuts to Australia's emissions. On the same day we had the shadow minister for infrastructure say that he stood for smaller cuts to Australia's emissions. Of course, we also had Mr Robb earlier than that calling for a carbon tax and we had Senator Brandis saying there was no action at all. Confusion reigns supreme. Confusion reigns supreme when it comes to the CPRS and climate change more generally. - Of course, this is a very good example of how those over there are so divided they cannot take a single consistent position on anything. They are so confused they are running around the place stabbing each other in the chest. They are so confused.What do we have when it comes to climate change? We have the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, we have legislation which has been put out in the public by the responsible minister and we have a path of action which will deliver certainty to Australian business. That is what Australian businesses are looking for from the Rudd government. We have an approach to reduce emissions by setting a price signal. We have a renewable energy target and we have a commitment to energy efficiency. What do they have on that side of the House? Absolutely nothing. The hide of the shadow minister to get up and ask that question. We want to give the Australian people certainty; you should give them certainty by supporting our legislation in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question and know that she has devoted a lifetime to working in the education and skills area.The Rudd Labor government obviously has set as one of its highest priorities delivering the education revolution we promised the Australian people at the last election. In these difficult economic days, with the global financial crisis and global recession bearing down on our economy, we have determined that in terms of stimulating the economy there is no better investment than investing in education and training. We made a decision on 3 February this year, when we announced a range of initiatives to assist households and stimulate the economy, that education would be at the top of the list.Through our Nation Building and Jobs Plan the government will provide a back-to-school bonus of $950. These payments are going out to 1.5 million families with over 2,760,000 children aged four to 18. This back-to-school bonus is to help those families with the costs of returning kids to education and training at the start of this year - and, obviously, every family knows that those bills come in when children return to school.This back-to-school bonus was, of course, designed to provide immediate short-term support to those families and to provide an immediate short-term stimulus to the Australian economy. Of course, it will be followed with our unprecedented historic investment in schools right around the country. Indeed, when we consider the Rudd government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan, the single biggest area of investment is in the nation's schools. - Of course we have members opposite interjecting because they opposed these payments to families and they oppose this investment in schools. They oppose schools around the country being upgraded - that is, they oppose $12.4 billion of investment in primary schools. They oppose $1 billion of investment in science and language centres for secondary schools. They oppose $1.3 billion of investment in our national school pride program. These programs are there to make sure that children in this country are learning in 21st century facilities, but these programs are also there to ensure that there is support for jobs right around the nation. - As members in this House know or, at least, those members who support their local schools know, schools are in communities right around the nation. Even very small communities have a primary school and consequently these programs will enable capital and infrastructure development in schools right around the country. - The members opposite might call out and might moan about this package but the great truth is they voted against it. Had they been the government, none of these payments would have flowed - no payments to assist families with the costs of going back to school, none of these big investments for schools right around the country, no investments in trade training centres and no investments in the digital education revolution. This is a government that is not only delivering what it promised but is delivering an historic new investment in schools right around the country. Members on this side of the House are proud of it, members on that side of the House would prefer to see local schools go without new facilities and local tradespeople go without work.</DOC>

 - Let me take the Leader of the Opposition through the history for his benefit. When this matter was first brought to my attention, I immediately put a stop on any recovery action. Then on 18 February, by way of a Chief of Army directive, we extinguished all debts. I then put in place a remediation plan, which is ongoing. I then appointed an independent mediator to liaise with families who might not be prepared to come forward and talk to senior Defence leadership and/or me. I then appointed an independent auditor -  The member for North Sydney then left the chamber. 
 - I then appointed an independent auditor to ensure all of my directives had been followed and fully implemented. His work is ongoing. Last Wednesday I travelled to Perth and attended Campbell Barracks. After meeting with around 120 soldiers to talk about more general issues, such as the coming white paper, I met with around 30 soldiers and, in some cases, their partners to work through with them any outstanding issues. I will continue to work through any outstanding issues to ensure that the men and women of the Defence Force are getting all the support they need and deserve. I will leave it to the opposition to continue to play politics with the men and women of the ADF.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. I know he has a concern for students in his electorate and indeed for the unemployed who are undergoing training. The support that we can provide them in this time, of course, is critical. We must respond to the challenges confronting the nation now but we also need to keep an eye on what we need to put in place when the economy is in recovery. It was therefore critical that the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan be put in place to respond to the current global financial crisis, the worst global economic recession in living memory. It was also important that we put in place an element of that plan, the training and learning bonus, which has two components: a one-off bonus of $950 for full-time students on youth allowance and recipients of Austudy and Abstudy as of 3 February this year; and a temporary supplement to the education entry payment of $950 for the period from 1 January this year to 30 June next year. That is in addition to the $208 paid for those unemployed people undergoing approved training. The government has also changed the eligibility criteria, ensuring that we bring forward the capacity for people to access this payment within a month of being on income support rather than a full year. These are practical steps that have been put in place by the government and opposed by every member opposite.Every member opposite has opposed the support in their electorates for students and unemployed people who are undergoing approved training. These people are in need of such support. We know that students are doing it tough in some areas and need to maintain their skills for the future. They need to acquire the skills required by our employers. If the unemployed are undergoing approved training and we can provide the support and they can acquire the skills required by employers in this country over the medium term, then it is important that we have the support of this parliament. But, unfortunately, each and every member opposite voted against this particular initiative, and therefore I am sure they will tell the students and the unemployed - those out-of-work Australians - in their electorates that they did not support them with this particular initiative. This government is not only about responding to our immediate concerns but has also focused on providing assistance in the medium term to job seekers and workers affected by the current circumstances. The government's Productivity Places Program will continue to help Australians, both in and out of the workforce, by offering them the chance to train and to retrain in a multitude of different areas in need.Through the Productivity Places Program, since April last year the Australian government has allocated 711,000 training places, of which 319,000 places are dedicated to job seekers. This will ensure, of course, that Australian employers will have the particular skills that they have been crying out for for many, many years. The results in relation to the Productivity Places Program speak for themselves. Since April last year, there have been 88,000 job seekers enrolled in the Productivity Places Program. Indeed, 30,000 of those 88,000 participants have completed their training. Many thousands of those 30,000 had already found work as of the end of the month.I am happy to inform the House that the government will continue to provide training and employment opportunities in the coming months. This, of course, will help our nation come out the other side of the current economic crisis in very good shape. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition has not concerned himself with jobs. He has not concerned himself with supporting a particular plan. The only job the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about is his own job, which probably is a precarious job. The only job he has concerned himself with is, of course, his own job. Instead of concerning himself with his own job, the Leader of the Opposition should be working with the government to assist employers, job seekers and others in the community who are doing it tough.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I also thank him for his advocacy on behalf of banana farmers. I know he takes seriously the challenges faced by that industry. Those challenges include continuing matters which must be dealt with in the area of quarantine. As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry indicated to the House most recently, the government is seized of the challenges which are presented to the industry at present. As a result, various determinations have been made by Biosecurity Australia.Australia's Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine has made a biosecurity policy determination for the importation of bananas from the Philippines. Biosecurity Australia advised stakeholders on 3 March 2009 the policy determination had been made. Australia's Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine has made a policy determination in establishing a quarantine policy for the importation of bananas from the Philippines. This decision is in line with the final import risk analysis report issued last November. I again draw honourable members' attention to the fact that this regime was established a long time ago, under the previous government. - He who interjects most volubly, the Leader of the National Party, as the minister for agriculture reminded us yesterday, is the pioneer and perfecter of the scheme which is now being deployed. The Philippines will be required to demonstrate to Australia's satisfaction that the risk management measures can be achieved under commercial conditions on an ongoing basis, with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service involved in ensuring compliance on the ground.For the information of the honourable member, my advice is that the required quarantine measures include the following: first, potential exports only from areas that demonstrate low pest prevalence; second, registration of export blocks; third, inspection to detect the presence of any diseases; fourth, ongoing inspections of blocks and fruit, including by Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service inspectors; fifth, disinfection and fungicide spraying; sixth, mandatory preclearance arrangements with the presence and involvement of AQIS inspectors in the Philippines in applying quarantine conditions in the field, including in packing houses; seventh, auditing and verification by AQIS of systems and processes used by the Philippines to certify any exports; and, eighth, detailed data and documentation to be provided by the Philippines for consideration by Australia prior to any exports to verify and validate quarantine measures, underpinned by laboratory and field experiments in commercial trials. In answer to the honourable member's question, these are the specific quarantine measures which will be applied to the decision and policy determination which has been made by Biosecurity Australia.I also note to the House the response which was conveyed yesterday by the minister for agriculture in terms of the response from the government of the Philippines on this question. It has described our banana quarantine policy as very stringent, expensive and trade restrictive and claims it will delay any exports. The Philippine agriculture undersecretary is quoted as saying:If the conditions are that strict, no industry can profit through exports.The reaction from the government of the Philippines to this stipulation and the conditions attached to it has been direct and critical of the government of Australia.I also say in response to the honourable member's question: I take very seriously the future of the banana industry in the country. It is a significant employer not just in the honourable member's electorate but also in parts of northern New South Wales and South-East Queensland. My father began life after the war as a banana farmer. I, therefore, through family upbringing and through relatives involved in the industry, know something of the challenges which are involved here. I would ask the honourable member to pay particular heed to the conditionalities attached to this importation determination and to the stringency associated with them.I am prepared, because I know the honourable member takes seriously the representation of industries in his electorate, to maintain a continued dialogue with him on this process as it unfolds. I accept absolutely the bona fides of the honourable member in raising these matters in this place, and I look forward to a continued discussion with him as these conditionalities are applied to the determination which has been made to Biosecurity Australia. This is an important industry for Australia's future which warrants the highest consideration on the part of our quarantine authorities and therefore, given the honourable member's obvious and legitimate interest in this industry, the basis for continued dialogue and discussion with me. I thank the honourable member.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question and her strong interest in the small business community in Tasmania. The Rudd government has had small business firmly in mind in designing its responses to the global financial crisis. The payments under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which will begin to flow to households this week, will quickly boost consumption and they will support small business in every community around the country. Let us be clear about this. Without these payments, things would be even tougher for small businesses. They would be under more pressure to cut their staff or reduce their hours. It is a pity that the opposition does not accept these basic economic facts. It is a great pity that the opposition voted against the Nation Building and Jobs Plan.But I am pleased to advise the House that the business community do clearly support the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, and their response has been overwhelmingly positive. I will just take a selection of two of the responses at the moment. The Council of Small Business of Australia said that it was a confidence boost for small business and that it would:_ provide benefit to many small businesses and to the communities in which they live and operate.The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia describes it as:_ a timely shot in the arm for small business.These payments are a critical and responsible measure to support jobs and growth until the much larger nation-building elements of our plan kick in - our investments in schools, roads and housing. Let us have a look at those. Australia's 1.3 million tradies, our independent contractors, will be the big beneficiaries of these infrastructure investments, which represent more than two-thirds of the spending under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. For example, tradies will be given work in the $14.7 billion program of Building the Education Revolution in every Australian school. Tradies will be installing insulation in 2.7 million Australian homes. Tradies will be engaged in the construction of 20,000 social and Defence Housing dwellings, and tradies will be working on improvements to the community infrastructure and upgrading the nation's roads with $890 million to be spent under this plan.Tradies will also join other small businesses in benefiting from our 30 per cent small business and general tax break, and that will provide a further stimulus to the economy - again, a point that is rejected by the opposition but supported by business organisations around the country. The NSW Business Chamber has described the tax break in these terms:NSW businesses will particularly welcome the $2.7 billion package of tax breaks for business.Again, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia said:CCCI believes the $2.7 billion tax bonus is an important and timely investment in the lifeblood of the Australian economy - small business.This is the tax break that the coalition voted against. The Australian Industry Group said:In particular, business welcomes the $2.7 billion investment incentive.The Combined Small Business Alliance of Western Australia said, with reference to the $42 billion economic stimulus measures:_ in particular the small business and general business tax breaks, you and your government are to be commended for your initiative and your endeavour to address the nation's dire economic circumstances.Master Builders Australia said:The building industry is predominantly made up of small businesses which should benefit from the Government's $2.7 billion Small Business and General Tax break.The National Farmers Federation said:Further, the $2.7 billion tax break for small businesses _ will be greatly appreciated by those small family owned farms.Finally, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia -  The member for Moncrieff then left the chamber. 
 - Indeed, Restaurant and Catering Australia did welcome the $2.7 billion tax break for small business which the coalition opposed. The Pharmacy Guild said:The Pharmacy Guild of Australia welcomes the tax break for small business.And:The measure comes at the right time to encourage community pharmacies to make productive investments _We are now moving towards the end of question time, and I notice that generally there is a question from the coalition when a survey of consumer sentiment comes out, but I note that we did not get one today. There is a pretty good reason for that: the survey of consumer sentiment was released not long before question time and it says, in part:On the face of this there is a surprisingly good result.It goes on to say:It may be that the index is now finding a base.Importantly, the Westpac Consumer Survey says:The big surprise came with the outlook for the economy over the next five years, which surged by 15.2 per cent. This could only be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence that current policies are providing a strong foundation in the longer term.Current policies that the coalition voted against and continues to campaign against. There is Bill Evans of Westpac saying that this is a very good result and that we are doing the right thing by the Australian economy with this Nation Building and Jobs Plan. The tragedy of the situation is that the only jobs that those opposite care about are their own.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Can I start on a sad note. Today, of course, is the funeral in Zimbabwe of Mrs Susan Tsvangirai, Prime Minister Tsvangirai's wife of 31 years, who was killed in a car accident on Friday. Over the weekend I asked our high commissioner to relay to Mr Tsvangirai, through his chief of staff, our deepest condolences at the death of his wife, and I am sure that sentiment is shared by all members of the House and by the Australian community.Mr Tsvangirai, of course, is Prime Minister of the so-called inclusive government. Australia's preference, of course, would be that Mr Mugabe walk off the stage, but like other nation-states we are forced to deal with the cards that are dealt. The fact that Mr Mugabe's presidency is ongoing is reflected by Australia's ongoing sanctions arrangements in both the financial and the travel area, which we are not proposing to disturb. By our view that, whilst to date Australia has rendered humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe, particularly in the food and health area so far as cholera is concerned, given the desperate need to rebuild Zimbabwe's social and economic fabric, the time has come for Australia to render additional assistance. Some might say that we are now moving into areas that go beyond strictly humanitarian assistance, but I think that, provided we take the appropriate balance of circumstances into account, we can render Zimbabwe development assistance and help to build their capacity and to support Mr Tsvangirai at what is a very difficult time for him and the people of Zimbabwe.I spoke to Prime Minister Tsvangirai in the middle of February and indicated that to him. As a consequence, I have indicated today that Australia will provide an additional $10 million of development assistance to the people of Zimbabwe. Five million dollars of that will be in the water, water sanitation and water infrastructure area and $5 million in the health area. The water contribution - the $5 million for water - will be made through UNICEF. Recently Zimbabwe's local authorities took control again of responsibility for the water infrastructure, and UNICEF dealing direct with local authorities, in our view, minimises the prospects that that money will be diverted for insidious purposes by Mr Mugabe or his associates.Secondly, so far as the $5 million for health is concerned, this contribution will be made through the United Kingdom Department for International Development, or DFID as it is known. The health system of Zimbabwe has collapsed and they are in desperate need of finding health professionals and health workers. DFID has recently introduced a program where they provide health workers and professionals with additional incentive payments. As members would appreciate, being on the salary of the government of Zimbabwe in the health area is not a reliable income. So we will contribute, through the United Kingdom Department for International Development, $5 million for payment incentives or incentives to health professionals and workers to rejoin what is effectively a collapsed Zimbabwean health system.We will look for further opportunities in the future to see what additional assistance we can bring by way of development assistance and capacity building, particularly in these social areas - health, water, water sanitation, education, food and agriculture - and we will do that bearing in mind the risks which are attendant upon the Zimbabwe situation given Mr Mugabe's ongoing presence.I conclude where I started. I think that, on the day of Mrs Tsvangirai's funeral, we send our deepest condolences to the Prime Minister. We wish him well at this difficult personal time but we also wish the people of Zimbabwe all the best for the future as they seek to rebuild their society, their economy and their social infrastructure.</DOC>

 - As the head of the IMF said yesterday, we are confronted with a global economic recession. A term which he has used to describe it is 'the great recession', from which no nation - including Australia - is immune, as reflected in the increase in unemployment in the numbers produced today. From the government's perspective, the loss of any job in Australia is the loss of one job too many. We do know that, had the government sat back and done nothing and just watched, the unemployment numbers produced today would be much worse.I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that, while it may not fit his political script, the unemployment numbers across the rest of the world today bear some taking into account. Across the OECD, the 30-member Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the January unemployment figure was 6.9 per cent. Of the major seven economies in the world - the G7 - it was 6.8 per cent, in the European Union it was 7.6 per cent and in the euro area it was 8.2 per cent. If you go to individual economies, the unemployment rate in Canada was 7.2 per cent, in Germany it was 7.3 per cent and in the Irish Republic it was 8.8 per cent. If you turn to other economies, the United Kingdom was 6.3 per cent, as most recently produced, and the United States was 7.6 per cent.I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that this is a global economic recession with implications for economies right across the world. If the honourable member were to pay attention to those individual unemployment numbers from each of the major economies around the world, he would see that Australia's economic stimulus strategy is having an effect in reducing the overall impact of the global recession on Australia. As I have said to this House on a number of occasions, no government can stop a global economic cyclone from coming across our shores, but a responsible government seeks to reduce the impact of that damage on Australia's workers, Australian businesses and Australian families. That is the responsible course of action. The alternative course of action is to sit, wait and see, and do nothing. That is what is being recommended by those opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for her question. If we look at the release of further economic data from around the world, it paints a fuller picture of the extent of the global economic recession and the contributing elements to it. Yesterday it was announced that China's trade surplus narrowed to $4.8 billion in February, approximately one-eighth of the previous month's surplus. - In 2007-08, China was Australia's largest trading partner and Australia's second largest export partner behind Japan. The shadow Treasurer interjected before, 'What about Australia?' If I am talking about the state of the Chinese economy and the state of Chinese demand for imports from around the world, and if Australia has as its second largest export market the People's Republic of China, I would have thought that even the shadow Treasurer could have concluded it was of some material relevance to jobs in Australia. But, again, that does not suit his political strategy.Service exports to Australia have grown at around 26 per cent since the start of the decade, as one simple indication of the significance of the Chinese economy to employment in our country. Furthermore, we have seen reports of a fall in Australia's thermal coal prices, with prices down 44 per cent on last year. Again, I would draw the shadow Treasurer's attention - given that he regards this matter as irrelevant to jobs in Australia - to the following possibility: as a result of that, earnings from coal and iron exports could decline by up to $35 billion from 2008-09 to 2009-10. That is sucking out $35 billion from the Australian economy. Therefore, you are faced with a very clear alternative: either you sit back, watch, wait and see, do nothing and seek to take political advantage from a global economic crisis - which is the political strategy of those opposite - or you engage in an economic strategy to reduce the impact on Australia. This government's resolve is to engage in such a strategy.Of course, other governments around the world are engaged in similar strategies. Again, I would draw the House's attention to the statement on Thursday of last week by the Chinese government that it had announced a projected deficit in its budget of 950 billion renminbi for 2009, a deficit of some three per cent of GDP for 2008. This is the highest fiscal deficit since 1979, including the deficit following the Asian financial crisis.These are the global economic realities with which every government around the world, including Australia, has to contend. Our strategy is straightforward: firstly, to stabilise Australian financial markets through the provision of our bank guarantees; secondly, the immediate stimulus through the provision of payments to pensioners, carers, farmers and others who need support, and through that the provision of support for the retail sector in Australia and the 1.5 million Australians who are employed in the retail sector; and, thirdly, longer term economic stimulus. That is the government's strategy; that is the one that we are embarked upon.I would simply say this to those opposite as they ask one politically driven set of questions after another: why do they have any problem with such a basic proposition that, as the rest of the world goes into recession, Australia is somehow not immune from world events, that it will affect Australia? Believe me, it will. How could they possibly disagree with a basic proposition like that? There will be an impact here in Australia and there will be an impact around the world. Therefore, that underpins the necessity for us prosecuting a strategy to deal with these circumstances.In recent times we had a statement to this effect - and I quote the member for Higgins because he is a person of some relevance to recent debates within the Liberal Party. In 2002, the member for Higgins said:But the idea that somehow Australia is immune from world events, that the rest of the world can go into recession and it won't affect Australia, believe me it does.That was the member for Higgins as Treasurer of Australia in 2002. Let us just look at what was happening in the world in 2002. What was world growth in 2002 when the member for Higgins was Treasurer and saying that Australia could not be immune from world events as the rest of the world goes into recession? World growth was 2.8 per cent in 2002 whereas, today, according to the IMF and the World Bank, growth in the world will be less than zero. - It seems that the member for Sturt and all those opposite are simply provoked by a presentation of the truth, because the truth to which I refer was uttered by none other than the member for Higgins, the Leader of the Opposition in waiting. In the events of 2002, the member for Higgins said that Australia could not be immune from global economic developments as the world goes into a recession. He said so when global growth was at 2.8 per cent. These days, it is running at less than zero, according to the World Bank. He said so when US GDP growth was running at 1.3 per cent in the June quarter of 2002. US GDP growth is now running at minus 1.6 per cent. He said so when unemployment in the United States was running at 5.8 per cent in May 2002. These days, it is running at 8.1 per cent.Under those circumstances, which were considerably less stressed globally than they are today, the member for Higgins, on behalf of the Liberal government at the time, said, 'The idea that Australia was somehow immune from these world events, that is just fanciful.' I would draw those opposite to a close and careful study of the member for Higgins' observations in times when we did not have a synchronised global economic recession, the great recession which we are now presented with the challenge to deal with. This government is getting on with the job. We have a strategy in place to reduce the impact on Australia. Those opposite have a political strategy, instead, just to take political advantage from the crisis. The contrast to the Australian people is absolutely clear.</DOC>

 - It is good to see that the Liberal Party focus groups have been at work, as they seek to again take political advantage of the global economic crisis when the government is seeking to implement an economic strategy to reduce the impact of that crisis on Australia. I would say to those opposite: reflect on the unemployment numbers in every significant economy in Europe that I referred to before. I would also say to those opposite: when it comes to dealing with the challenge of unemployment, you can either engage in the political rhetoric to which those opposite are now committed or you can get on with the job of doing something about it.This government has a clear-cut economic strategy. Firstly, we have sought to stabilise domestic financial markets by providing a guarantee to all Australian deposit holders, despite the fact that those opposite refused to provide such a guarantee, despite having received warnings over multiple years to do so. Secondly, we have provided direct stimulus to the Australian economy which has been supported by every peak business organisation in the country. The only organisation opposed to it is the Liberal Party. Thirdly, we are engaged in the direct implementation of short-term infrastructure building - in schools, in housing as well as energy efficiency in Australian owner-occupied dwellings. Those opposite, it seems, stand opposed.What continues to stun me is this: when this government implemented its economic stimulus strategy last October, the strategy which the Leader of the Opposition, or the temporary Leader of the Opposition, said that he supported at the time, for reasons of absolute political convenience, three months later, he turns around and says that he opposed it all the time. Well, I would say this to the Leader of the Opposition: one thing people require in politics, one thing people require when faced with a genuine threat to Australia's national economic self-interest, is consistency of policy and consistency of approach. On these things, we cannot see a skerrick of evidence on the part of the Liberal leader.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. I know that, like me and like other members of this House, he would be concerned to see Australia's rising unemployment figure of 5.2 per cent. We know that figure means many Australians are hurting. The government has been upfront with Australians that our economy would not be immune from the impact of the global financial crisis and global recession - the 'Great Recession'. We have been clear with the Australian people all along that it would impact on Australian jobs. That is why we took decisive action to stimulate our economy and support Australian jobs through the more than $10 billion invested in the Economic Security Strategy last year - initially supported by the Leader of the Opposition but now opposed by him - and that is why we took further action with the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, a plan to support jobs, which was opposed every step of the way by the Liberal Party.As the Prime Minister has made clear, unemployment is rising around the world. If we look at the US, for example, we know that its economy has an unemployment rate of 8.1 per cent, the highest in more than 25 years. And we know that 4.4 million jobs in the US have been lost since the US recession began in December 2007. In the UK the figure is 6.3 per cent and in the European Union the figure is 8.2 per cent. These are deeply concerning figures. And today's figure of 5.2 per cent in Australia means there are Australians who have been made redundant and need our assistance.In these circumstances the government has acted quickly to provide additional services to people who are made redundant and need support. Just today my colleague the Minister for Employment Participation introduced legislation to reduce the liquid assets waiting period for those seeking income support, doubling the threshold for singles to $5,000 and for couples to $10,000. That means people who find themselves newly unemployed will not have to run their savings down before they can access benefits. Our new $3.9 billion reformed employment services stream will begin on 1 July to provide more flexible job services to Australians who need those services. Last month the Prime Minister announced a new commitment of nearly $300 million so that newly retrenched workers can gain immediate access to more intensive and personalised employment services.In addition we have moved to provide new incentives to assist out-of-work apprentices. We know that in economic downturns we find ourselves in a situation where businesses tend to invest less in skills and training. When economic growth returns, everybody is crying out for skilled labour, and the lack of skilled labour ends up being a capacity constraint on growth. To assist those apprentices who may find themselves out of a trade, there are new incentives for employers and group training organisations to offer them an opportunity to complete their apprenticeships. In addition the Australian Apprenticeship Access Program will be expanded with a $30.2 million investment to provide at-risk job seekers with the support to undertake an apprenticeship or training. From this week, the $950 training and learning bonus will also be available to provide an additional incentive for social security recipients to return to education and training. The government cannot stop the global economic cyclone that arises from the global financial crisis and the global recession, but we can act to cushion Australian workers from its worst impacts and provide them with the skills they need for the future.</DOC>

 - The first point I would make in response to this question is that my recollection is that the particular strategy that the member for North Sydney is referring to is one that was supported and voted for by the opposition. The second point is that the implicit point in the member for North Sydney's question is based on a core fallacy, which yet again demonstrates that the member for North Sydney needs to take some economics lessons. The fallacy is that, when the government takes some kind of intervention to boost aggregate demand in the economy and thereby boost employment, nothing else is happening in the economy in the meantime. Of course, there are huge downward pressures on the Australian economy from the global financial crisis and the ensuing recession that has emerged. So the inherent fallacy in the position being taken by the member for North Sydney is that other factors are completely ignored.I will run through some of the indicators in the December quarter accounts which just illustrate what has been occurring in the Australian economy. There has been a huge reduction in business inventories and a dramatic increase in household savings rates, both of which indicate that the shock to confidence in this country and in most other developed countries that occurred in the early part of the quarter, particularly in the wake of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and all of the events surrounding that, has had a very significant impact on economic activity in this country.The member for North Sydney would prefer to ignore that. He would prefer to sit and wait. The Liberal policy is: 'Let's just see what happens. Let's not do anything. Let's not take action to ensure that we get payments moving into the economy' - payments which, Mr Speaker, I would remind you went to pensioners, to carers, to veterans and to families, and payments which were supported by the Liberal Party. - As has been indicated by people such as the chief executive of Woolworths, those payments help to sustain economic activity. They are continuing to help sustain economic activity and they are continuing to flow through into the Australian economy.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question and particularly for his very real concern for the 28,000 pensioners in his electorate. He understands, unlike those opposite, that these are very, very hard economic times for Australia's pensioners. While there is more to be done, the government has certainly made a start. We have made it clear to Australia's pensioners that we do intend to introduce long-term pension reform in the upcoming budget. Our Economic Security Strategy payments were a down payment on that long-term pension reform.I will just remind those opposite that the Economic Security Strategy payments went to four out of every five Australians aged over 65. I have to say it is becoming increasingly difficult to know what on earth the position is of those opposite. We remember when the Economic Security Strategy was announced the Leader of the Opposition came out straightaway and said he supported it. Then, a couple of days afterwards, he said he wanted to change it. Then he voted for it, and now it seems that they oppose it. It seems that they did not want those four million pensioners to receive a down payment on long-term pension reform.Just this morning we have discovered that the odd couple, the members for Sturt and Warringah - they seem to have finally buried the hatchet -  - I'm getting quite a lot of help from behind me, Mr Speaker! - I am sorry to say that they were both out and about whipping up sentiment because some of these payments have gone to pensioners living overseas. Let me just remind each and every one of those opposite that we have 22 social security agreements with overseas countries and 10 of those were announced by Liberal governments -  - As every member of this House should know, migration is a much valued part of Australia's history, culture and, of course, economy. Until this morning, these international social security agreements were considered to be bipartisan policy. Now we see that the Liberals opposite want to axe them. Why would that be the case? You only have to ask yourself the question once. For base political reasons, of course. These ambulance chasers opposite -  -  -  - To go back to the issue at hand: until this morning these international social security agreements would have been considered bipartisan policy. Given the comments made by both the member for Warringah and the member for Sturt this morning, I say to those opposite that they now need to explain to the 388,000 pensioners from overseas who live in Australia, whether they are Greeks, Italians, Americans -  - The member for Sturt then left the chamber. - As every member of this House should know, these incoming pensions provide a very significant boost to our economy. The arrangements in fact mean that $1.6 billion comes into Australia from overseas pensions compared to around $517 million in payments going to pensioners overseas. So, in net terms, our international social security arrangements deliver more than $1 billion to the Australian economy each year.Of course, it is not just pensioners living overseas whom those opposite want to get stuck into. We already knew that the opposition's theatrics on the pension last year were just a political stunt, but last night in the parliament we had the member for Warringah making absolutely crystal clear what the opposition's position on a pension increase actually is. Let me read what the member for Warringah last night said:_ the ability of the government to afford this kind of generosity towards pensioners is under enormous question.In other words, the opposition do not support any increase to the pension. It demonstrates just how completely out of touch the member for Warringah is. We of course all know how bored he is with the job. We all know that the member for Warringah does not think he is in the main political game. Here is a wake-up call to the member for Warringah: if you want to be in the main political game, you cannot be asleep in your office.</DOC>

 - One of the things that working families are interested in right now is the protection of their redundancy arrangements. One of the things that working families are interested in is practical action to support jobs. One of the things that working families are interested in is whether there is a practical strategy at work to support stimulus in the economy of the type this government has embraced. This party in government supports proper protections for Australians in the workplace. Those opposite have supported, through legislative action, the stripping away of protections - all effective protections - from workers in the workplace, including redundancies. In the current economic environment, for those opposite to be out there defending Work Choices, which stripped away basic protections such as redundancy payments, I believe is a matter on which they stand condemned.The question on the part of those opposite, including the member for North Sydney, goes to the impact of the Economic Security Strategy. I would say to the member for North Sydney, who was at the time the Leader of Opposition Business, that the Leader of the Opposition said, last October:_ we're not arguing about the size of the stimulus. We support these measures and we are particularly pleased about the measure, the payments to pensioners.What did the member for North Sydney say then? Did he oppose it? The Leader of the Opposition followed that up by saying, on 14 October:_ we are not going to argue about the composition of the package or quibble about it. It has our support.What did the member for North Sydney say then? I am waiting. Did he object? Last year, when the Leader of the Opposition was asked the question, 'Would the stimulus package work?' he said:Whether it is enough to make a difference, only time will tell.In other words, he was saying: 'Should they do more?' 'Yes, we support it,' he said last year. 'Oh, and you should think about doing more,' he said last year. Turn the clock ahead to this year and now he says, 'You'll remember that last year we said that the economic stimulus strategy would not be an effective fiscal stimulus.' I just draw the line under all of this for the benefit of those opposite.In the midst of a national economic crisis, people want leadership which is consistent. Those opposite, last October, out there on the doorstep, were saying that they supported every element of the economic stimulus strategy; and today, in a complete 180-degree turn, they say they have always been opposed to it. I say this to the member for North Sydney, who understands full well the complete cartwheel which they have turned on this entire question: he knows that the reason his question is not taken seriously in this place is that they have no consistency underpinning it. What Australians expect of the opposition is to engage in a serious debate about the national economic self-interest of Australia - a legitimate debate whereby we in Australia, through the government, seek to reduce the impact on working families which has been hit upon them by the global economic cyclone. Those opposite have one position one day and another position on another. The member for North Sydney was so courageous at the dispatch box just now, with a booming voice of conviction - a conviction which he fundamentally contradicted but three months ago.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for the question and acknowledge his strong engagement with primary producers in Tasmania. One of the important things about the Nation Building and Jobs Plan is the way in which farmers are able to receive cumulative payments. Today a number of them will start receiving for their families either the back-to-school bonus or the single-income family bonus, and as at 24 March the farmers' hardship payment will start making its way through. It is important to acknowledge that the payments that go through here meet demands that have been made in this chamber for some time. You will find that members on this side of the House have talked for a long time about the challenges that occur for farmers in their electorates. I will read from a media release that one member of this place put out last year:Country Australia is in urgent need of a massive economic stimulus package as a direct result of the prolonged drought and the chaos on the global stock markets.Disturbingly, the person who understood the problem and called for that stimulus package then came in here and voted against it. Should we maybe say, 'Well, it's somebody who put out the media release and didn't really understand the needs of farmers'? Maybe. It was the shadow minister for agriculture who made those statements and then came in here and voted against it.It is not only the frontbench. It would be unfair to only blame the frontbench members of the Nats. We have had things said by backbench members. The member for Gippsland is a great source of material. In a speech about drought, he said:Money is going to be needed for basic survival _ I believe our challenge with EC funding is to support these farming families to basically get them over the hump, knowing full well that they will prosper again on the other side when the rains come.Listen to this:This is not welfare or charity; it is an investment in the future of our nation's productive farming enterprises.We agree. The country Independents agree. The members on this side agree. The difference, of course, is that the Nats were sufficiently out of touch with the bush that when proposals were put in front of them they voted against them. If you look over your shoulder to the country Independents, you will find two of the most popular members of this chamber, who began their political careers the same way as the member for Gippsland. They began their political careers the same way as the member for Calare. They began by joining the National Party. They are now some of the most popular members in this chamber - because they left the National Party. - In trying to understand why on earth they would be doing this, why on earth they would be opposed to plans that, in advance of them being brought forward, they were calling for, the only thing you can work out is that they are all trying to second-guess and arrive at the same position as the member for Higgins. The member for Higgins was on the Alan Jones program this morning, and it is always -  - And we found this morning on the Alan Jones program how the plan has been received in the view of the member for Higgins. It is always a challenge in an Alan Jones interview how many words you get in, and the member for Higgins did pretty well. Alan got 860-odd words in; the member for Higgins, 1,300 - quite an achievement on that program. But the two words that never appeared during that interview, the two words that were never said during that interview at any point, were 'Malcolm Turnbull'. The two words that do not appear -  -  - The package and the reception of it on the Alan Jones program this morning go to the ongoing challenge of those opposite to actually support something that they called for. When the problem started, they were calling for precisely this sort of assistance, and it is very difficult to work out why on earth, when it comes to it, they are unable to support the package and the payments that are now being made to help some of our most needy people and to help as well boost economic activity at a time of global recession. Within that, we now count down to 25 May. If we make it to 25 May, as we look at how this program has been received, on 25 May the record of Alexander Downer will be safe as the shortest ever period as Leader of the Opposition, and then - </DOC>

 - As those opposite will fully understand, the government is in the process of changing Australia's industrial relations laws. Furthermore, those changes in large part depend on matters which have yet to be determined in the House and in the Senate. - I would have thought that those opposite - reflecting, as they are seeking to do, on the question of the future industrial relations laws of Australia - would bear in mind exactly what might be the future course of action and passage through the Senate. Again going back to what was said today on the Alan Jones program, the member for Higgins, the next Leader of the Opposition, said that if this legislation -  - On the question of industrial disputation, the honourable member will be fully aware that substantive changes to industrial relations laws in this country are pending the passage of our legislation in the Senate. That is the first point. The second is this: the destination of the legislation in the Senate is a matter which has not been resolved within the Liberal Party. Thirdly, the alternative leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Higgins, said today that this legislation -  - Mr Speaker, I am referring to the fact that industrial disputation is subject to the industrial relations laws of the time and general economic circumstances. Secondly, those opposite have not yet given their consent in the Senate to the passage of this government's industrial relations reforms. Therefore it is entirely material that when the alternative leader of the opposition was asked this morning whether this legislation should be rejected in the Senate he answered:Well, this legislation in the form that it is should not be passed.In other words, what the alternative leader of the opposition is now saying definitively is that those representing the Liberal Party in the Senate should block this legislation. The Leader of the Opposition currently, the member for Wentworth, has basically engaged in a strategy where their policy on industrial relations so far in the Senate is one of duck and cover; that is, 'Let's not tell anybody what we are going to do should amendments be rejected in the Senate.' That is their position. The person who has given definition to this is the next leader of the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question and for the assistance he has been providing me on procurement issues. One of the perennial themes of Australian politics is a conservative holy grail position of deregulation of the labour market. We can go all the way back to Stanley Melbourne Bruce and the dog collar act. Every time we have a conservative government in this country, one of its key principles is to seek to deregulate the labour market. The core theme that is always advocated by the conservative parties in these circumstances is that if employers are allowed to pay people what they like, treat them how they like and sack them when they like then that will create more jobs - there will be more jobs if employers are able to treat working people as if they were machines to be discarded or to be paid at whatever level they like.This is an age-old debate. I well remember being in this House seven, eight and nine years ago, well before Work Choices, and hearing people on the other side argue that because unemployment at that time was lower in the United States therefore the less regulated labour market in the United States was clearly superior and Australia should deregulate its labour market. Of course, they went a bit quiet subsequently because the unemployment rate in the United States went up, with no change in the regulatory regimes in either Australia or the United States. They moved on to other issues. But always the theme is the same: the answer to the challenge of creating jobs is to remove the rights of working people in the workplace. That is always the policy from the conservative parties. The truth is that the factors that influence the creation of jobs in our economy are overwhelmingly determined by one key factor, and that is demand - that is, the purchase of goods and services in the economy. That is what drives the creation of jobs in an economy. There are other issues but that is the dominant issue. That is why the government is focusing its economic strategy, in the face of overwhelming negative pressures from overseas, on creating jobs and on generating economic activity.The opposition is currently very confused about its position on this issue. But I am pretty confident they will default to their core beliefs - they will default to their core position - because there is one person in the parliament who has consistently advocated this position of a free market for workers, a free market for bodies in the labour market. That person strongly supports returning to Work Choices - strongly supports turning the clock back to the 19th century, amongst other things - and that person is the member for Higgins. The Liberal Party and the opposition do not yet know where they stand, though I am prepared to take a guess where it will be. But there is one person in the opposition who certainly knows where he stands, and that is the member for Higgins. In 2005 on these issues he told the Age:We should be trying to move to an industrial relations system where the predominant instrument is the individual contract.He is still trying. We do not know what the member for Higgins is on about with his ambitions at the moment. I have known him for a very long time, longer than most of you characters have known him, and I cannot work him out. Has he got a cunning plan? I am not sure. I knew him when he was in the Labor ranks. - The member for Melbourne Ports and I have got long memories about the member for Higgins. I suspect that the excruciating pantomime that we are currently all being exposed to - it is pretty excruciating for the Leader of the Opposition but it is, sadly, excruciating for the rest of the general public as well - is something we are going to have to put up with for a while. Maybe it is the member for Higgins going through some kind of public therapy process: all his angst and his bitterness being taken out. - The Liberal Party does face some big questions, but ultimately it is all the same question. The question of who should be leader is the same as the question: is the Liberal Party committed to bringing back Work Choices? - I can understand why the National Party does not want to talk about Work Choices. - There is a core question here. It has been a fundamental political debate in Australia for many years, and that is: are we to have protection of workers' rights in the workplace? That is the question you have to answer and, if the member for Higgins is the leadership solution for the Liberal Party, we know what the answer will be. - </DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. It is an important issue. The first Durban conference, which was a conference against racism and in favour of antidiscrimination, took place in Durban in 2001. The then government ensured that Australia was represented through the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the former Minister for Health and Ageing Kay Patterson. At the conclusion of Durban I, my predecessor, Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, issued a statement saying that a number of good things had come out of the Durban conference but that the Australian government was concerned about the anti-Semitic and anti-Jewish sentiment also expressed at that conference. As a consequence of that, until the middle of February no Australian official took part actively in the preparations for Durban II, which is a conference that will take place in Geneva from 20 to 24 April next month.On 16 February, as a result of like-minded nations including the United States and the European Union doing so, Australian officials took part in the preparatory or working group proceedings to see whether it was possible for the text which had been circulated to be improved. That did not prove to be the case. As a consequence of that, we saw the United States, a few days subsequent to those working group proceedings, indicate that unless improvements could be made to the text it would not take part in the conference.There are two nation-states who have indicated they will not take part in the conference under any circumstances: Israel and Canada. Two other nation-states, the United States and Italy, have indicated that, unless qualitative improvements are made to the text, they will not attend the conference either. As I have indicated publicly and privately over recent days and weeks to those people who have raised it with me, unless we see qualitative improvements made to the text Australia will not be attending either.The process we are following is this: the Russian chair of the working group has indicated that he is proposing to effect a revised and much shorter text by 16 March. We will carefully examine that revised text if it emerges. The working group is proposed to reconvene, from memory, on 4 or 6 April. The Australian government will give very careful consideration to what, if any, changes are made to the text to see whether it is appropriate for Australia to participate in the conference.If we form the view that the text is going to lead to nothing more than an anti-Jewish, anti-Semitic harangue and an anti-Jewish propaganda exercise, Australia will not be in attendance. We have ample time to make that judgment. We will give the working group every opportunity to revise the text in a qualitatively improved way to ensure that that does not happen, and we will make our judgment at a time of our choosing when we have given all nation-states concerned the opportunity to add qualitatively to the text to enable it to form the proper basis of debate at the conference. If it does not form such a basis, we will not participate in an anti-Jewish, anti-Semitic propaganda exercise.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Lindsay for his question. Yesterday's housing finance data shows that first home buyers are playing a very big role in the housing market these days. First home buyers now make up 26½ per cent of new home buyers. In fact, since October last year loans to first home buyers have averaged more than 12,100 a month compared with an average of around 9,000 a month before the introduction of the first home owners boost through the Economic Security Strategy. That is a 30 per cent increase that can be attributed directly to government action in introducing the first home owners boost and, of course, lower interest rates. That is obviously having a very significant effect across Australia.I am happy to report to members that the member for Lindsay has told me that in his electorate there has been a 175 per cent increase in sales at the Ropes Crossing development. From May to October, first home buyers accounted for just 13 per cent of sales in that development. But from October to February first home buyers have accounted for more than half - 55 per cent - of buyers in that new development. Lend Lease, the developer of the estate, have put on 36 extra full-time employees to deal with that extra demand. The member for Lindsay has also told me that Ralph Saporito of Glenmore Park Realty told him that home sales have picked up 20 per cent in his local area since the announcement, that that is mostly made up of first home buyers and that houses that are going onto the market in the member for Lindsay's electorate that are worth less than $400,000 a year are selling within days of going onto the market.The government's housing response to the global financial crisis has been in two parts. The first part, through the Economic Security Strategy, is the first home owners boost, which is helping young people into the housing market. The second part, through the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, sees direct investment in Defence housing and in social housing over the next couple of years. Indeed, last week I announced the allocation of $400 million for repairs and maintenance of public and community housing. This $400 million, as members will remember, was originally designed to bring up to 2½ thousand homes back into the public housing pool, homes that were either uninhabitable now or that would shortly be because of their very poor condition. The great news is that the states and territories have come back and told us that, instead of being able to fix 2½ thousand homes, they can fix more than 10,000 with this new money. A total of 10,648 homes will be saved from becoming uninhabitable and will be returned to the pool of public housing. New bathrooms, new kitchens, rewiring, plumbing, retiling, new driveways - all of that new work - will extend the lives of many of these homes by 15 to 20 years. On top of the almost 11,000 homes that will be returned to the pool of public housing, another 38,000 homes will have work done to them. So almost 50,000 homes right round Australia will have work done by electricians, plumbers, tilers and carpenters. All of the work done by tradies and their apprentices, as well as all of the materials that are needed to do that work, will have obvious economic stimulus effects right across Australia.There is another stage to our work in housing: new construction under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. We are looking at 2,300 homes in projects that the states and territories have had in the pipeline - on the drawing board, with plans drawn up and council approval - but have not had the money for. Those properties will go ahead as the next stage. Beyond that is the third stage: $5.3 billion of new investment to build new homes. Tradespeople right across the country will be building those homes. What is even better is that much of this building will happen in cooperation with private developers. A lot of these private developers in ordinary times would not be working with state departments of housing. In these times, when it is so difficult to get financing for major construction activity, the fact that state housing departments will contract with these developers for presales in their developments means that many developments will actually go ahead when they might not otherwise have been able to proceed.Yesterday I received the first state of supply report from my National Housing Supply Council. It reminds us that Australia is still undersupplied with housing. After 10 years of neglect from those opposite, we are still short of housing. It is going to take all of our efforts to make sure that we keep those tradespeople and apprentices in the building sector so that when the global financial crisis eases and access to finance is easier they can kick off their work at a higher rate once again. Our efforts will support continued building through this global financial crisis. They will support employment for tradies and apprentices right around Australia. Of course, our efforts will also put roofs over the heads of some of our most vulnerable Australians, including homeless Australians, who we are determined to assist.</DOC>

 - Once again, I directed that recovery action be stopped. The Chief of Army directive of 18 February effectively extinguished all debts. I always acknowledged that there was a chance that discrepancies would still appear in the very complex and large payroll system. That is why I have engaged an independent auditor to get to the bottom of this and to identify whether or not the directives were properly followed through and whether any such discrepancies still exist. Why have I done that? So we know what we are dealing with and we can deal with all the problems.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for both her question and her passionate advocacy on behalf of both students and universities. I note that those opposite, almost on cue, jump to the ideologically extreme battles of the past when we, on this side, are talking about a new and balanced way forward to rebuild services and amenities at our universities. We do this because we on this side know - and have long argued - that it is all students who are paying the price of the extreme legislation of the previous government. It just so happens that we do have new evidence to back this up. It is not just the students who are paying an extra $800 a year in child care at UTS, or those who are paying an extra $200 a year at Monash University, or those students who can no longer access sport, catering and welfare services. It is, in fact, all students who are paying the price of the previous government's approach, because it affects efforts to deliver quality teaching and research, to reduce class sizes and to attract overseas students - which we know are all critical to sustaining Australia's workforce and our future productivity and economic growth as a nation. I was asked for new evidence -  - I can report that last week, the chair of Universities Australia, Professor Richard Larkins, stated that the previous government's legislation had:_ directly impaired our ability to deliver quality education and research _He further stated:We had to use money [set aside] for research and teaching and use it to support the student experience on campus.These concerns, though, were further echoed by the University of Sydney when it said, in its submission to the Senate inquiry, that 'the university has been forced to redirect university funds to support the student experience'. We have also heard from the Australian Technology Network of Universities that reduced services are a significant threat to the level of international enrolments. Those opposite are so engaged in the arguments of the past that just earlier today -  -  - No, I would like you to listen to this. Just earlier today, we had the member for Higgins, in his comeback speech - in his big contribution to parliamentary debate - put forward the argument that you should vote against this legislation -  - I thank the member for Mackellar for that contribution. - Thank you, Mr Speaker, I will do that now. My point about the outdated argument that those opposite were making is that the argument being put forward by the member for Higgins earlier today was that you should vote against this because in 1975 a now defunct organisation passed a number of resolutions which he thinks is the current argument to be reading to the House. In contrast, we are talking about a new system moving forward. As stated, we have also heard from the Australian Technology Network of Universities that reduced services are a significant threat to the level of international enrolments. So all of this hampers our ability to deliver world-class universities - all because those opposite went too far. Now, despite the evidence, they will not admit to the damage they have caused - so they are in denial and voting against it.Can I also add that it is completely absurd and disingenuous for those opposite to shed crocodile tears over this capped and deferred $250 fee. We all know what you did when in government. We all got to see as, time and time again, you massively increased fees on students, you slashed support to students and you shifted the burden onto the shoulders of these same students. These same members opposite are now purporting to be so concerned about the financial plight of students that they voted against the $950 training and learning bonus to be delivered to all eligible students. I think we can all see the hypocrisy on show there. In contrast, we are taking action. We are proposing -  - Yes, we preferred the member for Mackellar's contribution, but thank you. In contrast we are taking action. We have delivered a new system. We are looking forward, and the opposition should get on board and do the same because it is critical to securing the future of our universities and the contribution that they make to our economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question, and I appreciate the way in which he represents the interests of his constituents and, more broadly, the interests of farmers in rural Australia who are doing it tough through a combination of drought and the impact of the global economic recession, the 'great recession'. The honourable member rightly raises the question of possible anomalies around the schemes which have been announced. It is for that precise reason that the government, in putting forward its program, also indicated that there would be an administrative scheme to deal with anomalous cases.Administrative payment schemes are common features for acts providing for lump sum and one-off welfare related payments. The purpose is to enable payments that are similar in purpose to those provided for in the act to be made to people who have missed out on the act payments due to unforeseen circumstances or unintentional limits in the operation of the act. This not something new; it has been done, I am advised, on previous occasions as well. Therefore, in the case of farmers to which the honourable member refers, I would strongly recommend that he advise those farmers to correspond, either through the member or directly to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, to seek to have these individual cases resolved on an individual administrative basis.Furthermore, I would say to the honourable member that on top of the farmers hardship bonus - which, as he rightly indicates, has been voted against by every member of the National Party in this place, and they know in their hearts that it was the wrong thing to do, but they still went ahead and did it - eligible farmers are also eligible for $900 if they have children who receive FTB part B and for a $950 back-to-school bonus for each school-aged child if they are eligible for FTB part A. I draw that to the honourable member's attention.Finally, what I would say to the honourable member is that, more broadly, the government is seeking to support families in rural areas who are dealing with the extraordinary circumstances which still prevail in many parts of the country through drought. Over $1.1 billion has been committed to exceptional circumstances assistance this financial year. As at 31 January 2009, there were approximately 19,630 farmers and 1,000 small businesses in receipt of EC income support. There are currently 71 EC-declared areas covering 49.1 per cent of Australia's agricultural land. - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question, and I contrast it with the interjections just received from the member for Murray. I would have thought that the member for Murray, representing a rural area, would have stood up for her constituents, would have stood up for farmers in her area and would have voted for these payments we are making to farmers in these distressed circumstances. Within her electorate, I am sure, the member for Murray would pretend every day of the week that she is out there, concerned about the interests of farmers. But when the rubber hits the road in this parliament, when she was asked to vote on the simple question of: 'Are you going to provide support for more than 20,000 farmers to receive this farmers hardship bonus', what did the member for Murray do? She voted against it. That is where the rubber hits the road. The member for New England voted for these measures. I have referred to the ways around the circumstances which he described. Each member of the National Party and each member of the Liberal Party representing a rural area has voted against it - and they should hang their heads in collective shame.</DOC>

 - Today I had the pleasure of visiting the Australian Federal Police forensic facilities with the Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq, His Excellency Mr Nouri Kamel al-Maliki. The Australian government has committed itself to provide continuing assistance to Iraq, which has the purpose of ensuring that credible institutions can be built and maintained to serve the Iraqi people. Of course, the Iraqi police service is an important example of one of those institutions.Some very significant research which has been conducted over recent years by the Australian Federal Police has revealed quite extraordinarily high correlations between the existence of the rule of law on the one hand and human development and economic prosperity on the other in countries around the world. That research very clearly demonstrates what common sense would suggest: that security and public order are critical to the success of emerging and developing states like Iraq. Australia is one of several donor countries now providing assistance to Iraq, along with the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union.No matter what country they live in, people deserve the protection and security of a strong police force. That role is provided by the AFP with integrity and with professionalism in our own country, and that is why the government has entrusted the AFP to provide support and training to the Iraqi police service. Over the next three years the AFP will conduct training programs for over 240 members of the Iraqi police service, training especially designed to meet their particular needs. The program includes courses in advanced crime scene investigation, bomb data awareness, high-tech fingerprint chemical analysis, laboratory management, forensic biology and, not insignificantly, police leadership. The first officers from Iraq arrived in January and, over the course of the program, they will be drawn from right across that country.During their three-month course they will have the opportunity to broaden their skills through access to the specialist knowledge and experience held by the AFP. Indeed, the AFP's expertise in forensics, in particular, is recognised around the world. Training is conducted at the National Centre for Forensic Studies and the Canberra Institute of Technology.After visiting Iraq in 2008, the AFP noted that their forensic laboratories were well equipped and that they might benefit from additional training that would build on their existing capabilities. As part of this program participants will benefit from leadership training at the renowned Australian Institute of Police Management. The aim of the program is to build strong relationships of trust between our two countries, and that does fulfil an important commitment made by the Australian government to the people of Iraq.</DOC>

 - I say to the member for Bowman that the risk to federal funds for Queensland lay with his opposition in voting against the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. I would suggest to the honourable member that he 'fess up to his constituents that he voted against the school modernisation program for every primary school in Bowman and every secondary school in Bowman, against social housing in that part of Queensland and against energy insulation in his electorate as well. I think the monumental hypocrisy of that question being asked by a member who voted against the program is beyond all proportion.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his timely question. The government is investing $26.4 billion - Commonwealth funds on the table - for our nation-building program. There will be record investment in road and rail projects right around the nation. In Queensland alone, that investment is worth some $6.5 billion.It is on the table through a memorandum of understanding with each of the state and territory governments. Every state and territory government has signed up to the nation-building program. Because Queensland is in election mode, it is unable to at the moment, but the Bligh government has indicated that it would sign up and therefore get Labor's record $6.5 billion of funds for road and rail in Queensland.The Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Springborg, said last week that he would honour the offer that was there and sign up and be part of the plan. But, of course, this lasted two days, and then he made a demand: 'We don't want $6.5 billion - we want half of that amount for Queensland.' He said he would sign up if he got the same offer that Queensland got under AusLink under the Howard government - half of what the Rudd government is offering Queensland. We offer twice the capital injection, and the Leader of the Liberal National Party in Queensland says no. We have got on the table $1.14 billion for the Dinmore to Goodna section of the Ipswich Motorway - up to 1,000 construction jobs - and the Leader of the Liberal National Party says no. We have got on the table $455 million for the upgrade of the Pacific Motorway - up to 500 construction jobs - and the Leader of the Liberal National Party says -  Government members - No! - We have got on the table $55 million for the Douglas arterial - up to 200 construction jobs - and the Leader of the Liberal National Party says -  Government members - No! - No! We have got $300 million on the table for the upgrade of the Mains and Kessels roads intersection. The Leader of the Liberal National Party in Queensland says -  
Government members - No! - The Prime Minister went to this road in the electorate of Moreton and made that election commitment. Last week Mr Springborg went to the same venue and said that it should not proceed and that they would intervene to stop the federal government spending federal funds to build roads in Queensland. What they do is -  - One of your best, Pete! The fact is that the Bligh government have said yes to partnership with the federal government in road and rail and nation building. But the Queensland opposition have said that they want a carbon copy of the Howard government's plan from 2007, which is to have an election commitment cancelled on the Mains and Kessels intersection, to go back to the drawing board and to do nothing - just like when it comes to economic policy. They have one thing in common with the federal opposition, whether it is the Liberal National Party in Queensland or the Liberals or the Nationals or whatever they are called here: their strategy when it comes to nation building, when it comes to jobs and when it comes to economic stimulus is to do absolutely nothing.</DOC>

 - What a confused question from the member for Hume - a confused question from a confused opposition when it comes to nation building. He asked me questions about the Hume Highway. I will tell the honourable member about the Hume Highway. We are investing $950 million on the Hume Highway, a record investment. I have visited the Hume with the member for Riverina, inspecting the works of the Rudd government on the Hume Highway -  - I got asked about the Hume Highway and I am answering about the Rudd government's proud record of record investment in the Hume Highway - just like we have record investment in the Pacific and the Bruce highways. In May, I will be visiting the Hume Highway to open a number of projects with the member for Riverina - who has a much more constructive attitude towards that important highway than her colleague the member for Hume.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for this question. She, like many members on this side of the House, has a keen interest in making sure that our alcopops measure is passed by the Senate next week. I can update the House that the public hearings that the Senate has been conducting into this measure have now been completed. We look forward to the report in the coming days. But what was very clear from the evidence that was given over the last two days is that the health experts - including public health academics, the doctors and the AMA - have all sided with Labor, with our government, in supporting this tax and arguing that if it was removed it would be a retrograde step.The only people who are on the other side of this argument are the Liberal Party and the distillers. The Liberal Party have been going around pretending that, if this measure is not passed, the money will be able to go off to some worthy cause of their choosing when in fact the clear legal obligation, if this bill does not pass the Senate, is to have money go back directly to the very distillers and distributors who are making and selling these products to our young people. The distillers, of course, are pretending that they do not want the money back. But what has been interesting - although DSICA, the advocacy body for the distillers, said this in August last year, they said it in February and they said it yesterday - is that we now have evidence that one of the major members of DSICA in fact has made clear that they do want to the money back if this bill is not passed and that DSICA has been trying to hoodwink the public, in the same way that the Liberal Party have been trying to hoodwink the public. If they vote against this measure and it fails in the Senate, hundreds of millions of dollars will go back directly to distillers and their distributors to sell even more of these products.Not only has DSCIA refused to tell the public - it was not made clear until it was uncovered in the Senate inquiry yesterday - that Bacardi Lion, one of the big producers of alcopops, has said that they want the money back if the tax is not passed in the Senate, but, in fact, we find out that DSICA actually wrote to each and every one of their members - to each and every one of the distributors - last year providing advice to them about how to protect their rights to get a refund in case this matter failed to pass the Senate. This is exactly what they have been lobbying for. All of this has been a pretence. From the very beginning, the Liberal Party, including the Leader of the Opposition, has pretended there is not a binge-drinking problem. We have seen the shadow minister pretending the money is going to back to some worthy cause, rather than to the distillers, when we know that that is the truth. And we have had the distillers themselves pretending they do not want the money, while at the same time they are writing to their members, arguing for them to keep receipts and be able to claim refunds, and ignoring the fact that one of their significant members actually disagrees with them.What we have seen is just a complete shambles from those opposite. They have not understood that there is a big community problem here and we are trying to tackle it. They are just a mess. The rest of question time has been evidence that the Liberal Party has no idea any longer of what they stand for, who they stand for, who is leading them, what leadership there is or even what the law will be if this bill does not get passed. It is about time the Liberal Party admitted that they are just a lost cause, got out of the way and let us pass this bill in the Senate and get on with our good, health related prevention measures.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, because it goes to the future of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and in particular to the provisions which are contained within that scheme to get the balance right between the economy, its strength in the long term, and jobs - to reduce carbon pollution in Australia in order to act effectively on climate change. The government's guiding principle through-out the debate on emissions trading and climate change more generally is that, because Australia is the hottest and the driest continent on earth, the Australian economy and jobs will be hit hardest and earliest among all countries in the world through climate change; therefore, the government has resolved that it is much better for Australia to act in the manner which we have outlined in order to reduce the impact on jobs over time as well as acting effectively nationally and in concert with partners around the world on this matter as well.The government's core argument is - and it goes to the question of Xstrata as well as the emissions intensive trade exposed sector of the economy - that the economic costs of inaction on climate change are far greater than the economic costs of action. This has been reflected in Treasury modelling that we released in October 2008, which indicated that the long-term costs of inaction would be 15 per cent higher than if action were taken earlier on this. - The honourable member asked me a question about a company which is in the emissions intensive, trade exposed sector and about the consequences of the implementation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme for companies in that sector and unemployment. That is the response that I am providing to him. I also draw the honourable member's attention to the government's core rationale again: that the costs of not acting now are far greater than would otherwise be the case.I would draw the honourable member's attention to this question and to a point which he himself made last year on the matter of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme or more broadly on emissions trading. This is on the question of when you should take action and when you should not. When he was asked by Laurie Oakes, in July of last year, about the Shergold report, he said - and he quotes, therefore, the position of the opposition at the time:It is our view that the costs that are clearly there for taking action now are probably more than offset by the potential risks of not taking action. - It goes to the question of the implementation of emissions trading and the official position of the Liberal Party, as reflected by the current leader of the Liberal Party, is as follows:It is our view that the costs that are clearly there for taking action now are probably more than offset by the potential risks of not taking action.That is a quote in a question from Laurie Oakes to Mr Turnbull. Mr Turnbull replied:Well Laurie, the Shergold report, as picked up in the Howard government's policy last year, remains our policy. -  -  - The question was put to Mr Turnbull by Laurie Oakes. When Mr Turnbull replied: 'Well Laurie,' I presume that was a response to Laurie Oakes - unless there was some other Laurie in the room - the point of it being:Well Laurie, the Shergold report_remains our policy.The Shergold report says:It is our view that the costs that are clearly there for taking action now are probably more than offset from the potential risks of not taking action.What we have again is simply this: whether it is on economic stimulus, whether it is on Work Choices, whether it is on carbon pollution reduction, the Leader of the Opposition changes his policy by the day and by the week. Is it any wonder that people in this nation ask where the Liberal Party stand on any matter of policy today when this Leader of the Opposition changes his policy by the minute, by the hour, by the month or least every six months?This government's approach to the challenge of climate change is consistent. We believe we must get the balance right between dealing with the challenge of climate change for the future and doing it responsibly to support jobs and the economy and to engender the job creation which will come out of the renewable energy sector of the economy. We have been consistent throughout. Less than nine months ago the Leader of the Opposition had precisely the policy I have just described. Nine months later, under pressure from elsewhere in his party, he has flip-flopped yet again.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the applause I am getting from the other side of the House; I did not realise we had so many music fans! I thank the member for his question, because the Rudd government is taking an economically responsible approach to tackling climate change. It is building a low-pollution economy by introducing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme -  -  - It is a day job I relish, Mr Speaker. The government is bringing forward practical action on energy efficiency for households through insulation and solar hot water for around three million Australian homes. We know that the longer we wait to take action on climate change the more it will cost and the more jobs that will be lost as a result of the drastic impact climate change can bring.As the Prime Minister just said to the House, as we are one of the hottest and driest continents on earth, Australian jobs will be hit hardest and fastest by climate change. So we need to act; we need to grow jobs in clean, low-pollution Australian industries. When he was my predecessor as the former environment minister, and most recently when he wanted the Liberal Party leadership, the Leader of the Opposition himself acknowledged the importance of climate change and said that he was all for an emissions trading scheme. In 2007 he noted that putting a price on carbon was 'essential'. In May 2008 he said:_ the emissions trading scheme is the central mechanism to decarbonise our economy. - As the Prime Minister noted, the Leader of the Opposition also spoke on this in an earlier interview with Laurie Oakes, and on Lateline on 9 July he said:_ the Howard Government's policy last year, was that we would establish an emissions trading system not later than 2012. It was not conditional on international action.He went on to say:_ John Howard decided and the Cabinet decided last year that we would move on an emissions trading scheme come what may.That was the Howard government's policy, and that was the opposition's policy last year - moving on an emissions trading scheme 'come what may'. What has happened is that we have had a phalanx of climate change deniers, we have had the member for Higgins suddenly speaking up and now the opposition leader has said this morning: 
I would not support finalising the design this year.The reason he has given is:Even the best designed scheme in theory needs to have the input of the knowledge of what happens at Copenhagen and what the Americans will do.So we have gone from 'not conditional on international action' and doing it 'come what may', with an ETS as the 'essential mechanism', to absolute delay. What has happened in the intervening period? We know what has happened. When he was environment minister the Leader of the Opposition was campaigning for an emissions trading scheme; now he is campaigning for his own position as leader and he is against emissions trading. The Leader of the Opposition is not waiting to see what America does on emissions trading; he is waiting to see what the member for Higgins actually says.Regrettably on a matter as serious as this, the only job that is being protected by the Leader of the Opposition is his own. Those future jobs that Australians will get from taking decent and prudent action on climate change will now be delayed. Only sceptics believe that delaying action on climate change is good for jobs, because they do not believe that climate change actually poses a risk to jobs. But the Rudd government understands that failure to deliver the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will result in jobs being lost in tourism, agriculture and food production as a result of climate change impacts. The opposition leader's retreat on climate change puts at risk the future of our environment, economy and jobs. This government will continue to prudently and purposefully take responsible action on climate change because Australians expect nothing less.</DOC>

 - The honourable member would be aware that the scheme which has been put forward by the government, for which the draft legislation has been already circulated, has elements within it which deal with the emissions intensive trade exposed sector. Also it deals with the household sector. On top of that it also deals with the electricity sector. On top of that we have also established a Climate Change Action Fund. The honourable member should be aware of the fact that the Climate Change Action Fund has within it a range of substreams for which various sectors of the economy are able to apply - one of which relates to parts of the coal industry as well. The honourable member would be familiar with that if he were familiar with the legislation. I would draw his attention to it. I would also suggest to the honourable member that what the Australian people expect of the alternative government of this country is consistency on climate change, consistency on emissions trading, con-sistency on economic stimulus and consistency on Work Choices, rather than a party which makes it up every day as it goes along.</DOC>

 - The government's response to the global recession is to embark upon action here at home aimed at reducing the impact of the recession on Australia, as well as actions abroad to work in partnership with other governments to deal with the cause of the problem, which is the problem of the collapse of private credit flows through the global banking system. Our actions at home are well known to members of the House. They include the stabilisation of domestic financial markets; the provision of the government's guarantee on bank deposits within Australia; the provision of a short-term stimulus by way of payments to pensioners, carers and veterans to support the 1½ million Australians who work in the retail sector; investment in longer term infrastructure through the biggest school modernisation program in the country's history; and other investments as well. Furthermore, we are doing this in a fiscally responsible manner consistent with actions taken around the world - short-term deficits, short-term borrowing and short-term debt - in order to fund what is necessary to provide stimulus to the economy. Every government around the world is engaged in these actions at present. It is the responsible course of action.These are the actions in which we are engaged on the home front to provide economic stimulus support to take up the slack, to the greatest extent possible, that is being left by a private economy in retreat because of the collapse of global credit flows - and that, in turn, goes on to impact on Australian jobs. This government is taking every form of domestic action necessary to continue to support jobs in the Australian economy when the private sector has been moving in the reverse direction.That is one part of what the government is embracing. The other part is our actions abroad. Over the weekend the Treasurer, representing Australia, and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, representing the Reserve Bank of Australia, attended the G20 finance ministers meeting and central bank governors meeting in the United Kingdom. This is a necessary stepping stone towards the G20 heads of government meeting in London in a couple of weeks time. This is necessary in terms of international cooperation and coordination because of the starkest warnings recently by both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank about the prospect of the global economy, for the first time, in 2009, actually contracting. This underlines the absolute importance of coordinated global action.The finance ministers agreed, in their statement coming out of the meeting in London, upon a request to the IMF to monitor the implementation of existing fiscal policies and report on the need for further stimulus. What we do in Australia to provide stimulus is one thing, but what the rest of the G20 economies do is critical in terms of the overall health of the global economy and, underpinning that, the restoration to normality, over time, of global trade flows. Furthermore, finance ministers have agreed on a common framework of principles to deal with toxic assets that are poisoning some of the world's major banks. This framework on toxic assets contains a common set of principles which underpin a common global approach on the valuation and restructuring of financial institutions. This is necessary if we are to deal with the poison which currently exists within the global financial system - namely, toxic assets sitting on the balance sheets of our globally significant banks. That is where the problem lies in terms of the restoration of normal credit flows to the global economy.Also, finance ministers have discussed the need for important and decisive action on the future resources and governance arrangements for the International Monetary Fund. Toxic assets within global banks are one thing, but what flows through to the emerging economies, their financial institutions and their international capital flows is something else - and it represents a further future threat to the global economy. Therefore, finance ministers over the weekend also recognised the need to reform the governance of the IMF to give emerging economies a greater say in how these organisations are run and to give further consideration as to the long-term resources of the IMF. I have already mentioned in this House and elsewhere the emerging problems in various economies in the world. We are particularly concerned about the prognosis in Central Europe and Eastern Europe. Beyond that, the finance ministers have focused on the future rules for the governance of the international financial system. Ministers agreed to ensure that systemically important financial institutions, including hedge funds and including institutions which operate in more than a single jurisdiction are appropriately regulated - as well as strengthening their analysis of systemic risk. These are important building blocks going forward in terms of what must be an integrated global response to a global recession.Furthermore, I report to the House that over the weekend Australia was also invited to join the 11 countries on the Basel committee - that is, the global body that sets standards for global banking. I would make note in this House of the fact that that represents an acknowledgement of the contribution that Australia is making to the reform of the global financial system and is a direct and personal tribute to the standing of, among others, the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the way in which he is regarded by his counterparts around the world.There are still some weeks to go before the summit of heads of government in London for the G20, and much work is still to be done. What occurred over the weekend at the finance ministers meeting and the meeting of the central bank governors represents useful building blocks towards a positive outcome in London. But that outcome, at this stage, is by no means guaranteed. It is absolutely essential, if we are to see economic recovery in this country and across the world, that we have a restoration to health of the world's leading financial institutions. Much, therefore, will hang upon the deliberations which occur between now and the events in London.I thank the Treasurer, in his absence, for his contribution to the important meeting which occurred in London over the weekend, but I again emphasise to the House that, along the way in seeking to restore the global financial system to order, we have many, many bridges yet to cross. Many governments have different views on the way in which we need to get to the outcome which is necessary, but I assure the House that this government is actively engaged at every level with every government around the world to seek to bring about a necessary consensus across the G20 in order to underpin the long-term stability of the global financial system. That is fundamental to the restoration of long-term economic normality in this country as well. That is why the government is as active internationally on these questions as we have sought to be in the decisive action we have taken domestically.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government's overall approach to the deep question of climate change is - and I say again what the core principle of the government's policy attitude is - that the economic costs of inaction on climate change are far greater than the economic costs of action. I also note for the record that that was the position of the Leader of the Liberal Party as recently as last year. What we have seen through the pirouettes in policy which have occurred over the course of the last weekend by the Liberal Party and its leader is again flip, flop, flap - on climate change policy as well. This goes directly to the honourable member's question about the future of industries in this country and getting the balance right for jobs, including in the aluminium industry, and the structure of the scheme which we have put forward, as I described before. But what the people of this country expect is consistency of policy. What we have had from those opposite is flip, flop, flap, not just on the question -  - What the people of this country - engaged in a debate about the economy, engaged in a debate about jobs, engaged in a debate about the future of emissions trading - want is for both sides of politics to have some consistency. What we have put forward through the green paper, through the white paper, through the draft legislation, is our approach of dealing with what is an economic problem for Australia - namely, how to deal with climate change. Again I say this is the hottest and driest continent on earth; therefore the jobs consequences and economic consequences will be felt in Australia hardest and earliest compared with other countries.The honourable member also refers specifically to the aluminium industry. I draw his attention to the fact that it is listed in the CPRS white paper as one of the activities likely to receive 90 per cent free permits. I just draw that to his attention. I also draw the honourable member's attention to the following - that, when it comes to consistency of policy, last year they were saying that action on climate change and emissions trading was necessary, irrespective of international action. This year they have changed again. Last year we had in fact the Leader of the Opposition saying that commencement could be in 2011-12. Now he says it is to be only in 2012. - Those opposite are arguing, in terms of their position - whatever it happens to be on climate change now - that they can only start, it seems, in 2012. In recent times it has been 2011-12. Before that it was 2011. But the next Leader of the Opposition, the member for Higgins, has actually said:We're talking about getting it up and running by 2010.That was Peter Costello on The 7.30 Report back in the year 2007. - Again I draw the member for Goldstein's attention to the fact that, when it comes to the aluminium smelting industry, it was listed in the CPRS white paper as one of the activities likely to receive 90 per cent free permits. We understand on this side of the House the challenges of transition. That is why we have embarked upon the scheme that we have, together with the other elements of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which those opposite choose to ignore in their partisan presentation of the debate today.Again, I go back to the whole question of consistency. Our approach, through the green paper, through the white paper, through the draft legislation, is about getting the balance right between what we do on climate change and how we support the economy and jobs. Again, the flip, flop, flap from those opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, is about starting dates - whether it is 2010, 2011 or 2012, depending on the season - and should it be conditional international action or should it not? The answer changes all the way through.But then we come to what I thought was a remarkable statement by the Leader of the Opposition over the weekend where he says this:The emissions trading scheme is just one tool in the climate policy tool box. Well-designed it is a useful tool, but it is not a necessary tool at all.That is the Leader of the Opposition, 16 March 2009. Roll the clock back to 21 May 2008. Mr Turnbull says:The emissions trading scheme is the central mechanism to decarbonise our economy.So nine months ago the emissions trading scheme is the central mechanism to decarbonise the economy and nine months later, because of some political pressures from the right wing of his party, he says, 'Well, it is just one tool in climate policy and it is not a necessary tool.' What rank inconsistency and hypocrisy. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for her question. The current skilled migration numbers, set in May 2008, address the critical skill shortages that Australia was confronted with after 11 years of disgraceful neglect of skills training by the former Liberal government. After an extraordinary period of growth Australia is now entering a new and challenging period, of course caused by international events from which Australia cannot be immune. As a result, the outlook for employment in this country has changed dramatically.As a government, we believe in action in the face of this grim outlook. In addition to our stimulus packages, the government have also decided to reduce the number of skilled migrants places available in the 2008-09 intake. We have done this to protect local jobs while ensuring that employers can access skilled professionals in industries that are still experiencing shortages. In addition to cutting the number of skilled migration places, we have also removed building and metal manufacturing trades from the critical skills list. This decision has been made in response to the recent contraction in the mining and construction sectors. The list will now comprise mainly health and medical, engineering and IT professions. The government, business and industry all agree that Australia still needs to maintain a skilled migration program but one that is more targeted so that migrant workers are meeting skill shortages and not competing with locals for jobs. It is one step of many that we are taking to respond to the global financial crisis and to seek to cushion the effects on Australian families and the Australian economy.This step comes on top of our investment in helping support Australian jobs from the worst impacts of the global recession and global financial crisis, including our $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, our $10.4 billion economic security strategy, our $6.3 billion New Car Plan for Australia, our $4.7 billion National Building Package, our $300 million to support local government infrastructure and our $15.1 billion COAG package which was predominantly focused on schools and hospitals. The government stands ready to take further action as necessary but has taken these actions to support Australians in these difficult times.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Pardon me for getting it wrong, but I thought their position was that Work Choices was dead. -  - It is part dead, is it? The parrot is not fully dead; it is only part dead. - In framing the government's industrial relations policy for the future, we have done so in a manner entirely consistent with the package that we put to the Australian people prior to the last election. We have done so in a manner which is consultative with both business and with unions on a whole range of matters -  - The honourable member asked a question about the prospective impact of the industrial relations legislation on a small business operator. As honourable members in this House would be aware, the circumstances concerning any individual small business operator in the country are only ultimately known to that small business operator, and I respect entirely the point of view put forward by anyone in the business community. It is their democratic right to object to or to support any element of the government's legislation.What I would say is that, in framing the government's legislation, the government have been absolutely consistent. We have said from the beginning that we will act on the basis of getting the balance right between employers and employees; that we will provide a guarantee for those employees out there who had, through Work Choices, their redundancies stripped away from them; that we would act in support of those employees who have had other basic working conditions, such as their overtime penalty rates and other basic safety net provisions, stripped away from them. That was our mandate from the last election. Also, that is what we have reflected throughout the legislation.We have been consistent throughout on this matter. And I would say to those opposite, to those who have said most recently that Work Choices is dead - Leader of the Opposition - and to those who have said most recently that the government's position on unfair dismissal is one for which we have a mandate and they understand it, that again we see the same pattern, as has already been evidenced today in the matter of climate change. As to what they said last year and what they said earlier this year, it is a completely different season now that the Leader of the Opposition is under attack from the member for Higgins. What the Australian people want at a time of global economic recession and crisis is consistency of policy from the government. They would have the same expectation of consistency of policy on the part of those opposite. Is it their position today that Work Choices is dead? I would like to hear from them on that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. She certainly would recall, as members on this side of the House do, that before the 2007 election the Labor Party did something that the Liberal Party would never have dreamt of doing - that is, we published a comprehensive workplace relations policy and sought a mandate for it. Of course, in 2004 the then Howard government went to the election and did not breathe a word of Work Choices to the Australian people - not one word - only to visit Work Choices on the Australian people after the election.We took a different approach - an honest approach, a straightforward approach - with the Australian people, and we published our policies comprehensively. I refer most particularly to the policy implementation plan of Forward with Fairness published in August 2007, which sets out our comprehensive plan for unfair dismissal, including committing special arrangements for small businesses with fewer than 15 employees. In this document we got the balance right, the balance between making sure that good employees get protection at work and making sure employers, particularly small business employers, have a system that will work with them and for them.What is amazing in moving through this debate is the many positions of the opposition. Of course, under Work Choices, they said to the Australian people: 'It doesn't matter if you are a good worker; it doesn't matter if you are a great worker. If you work in a business with fewer than 100 employees then on any day your employer can terminate your employment and you will have no comeback.' Ministers who are now sitting on the opposition front bench would come to this dispatch box every day and defend the rip-offs and rorts of Work Choices, including good workers being dismissed for no reason - every day.When we were elected with our policy to create a system to deal with unfair dismissals, I was very intrigued to see that the Leader of the Opposition, when asked about it in December last year said this very clearly:Labor took a proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to the election and won. So we must respect that.Those were the words of the Leader of the Opposition. Now what we know is that, in an act of short-term political opportunism about his own job, the Leader of the Opposition is now repudiating his own words from last December. The Leader of the Opposition is a man who cannot hold a political position across three or four months. He will say or do anything in order to curry favour with those who sit behind him.Interestingly, this morning the game was made absolutely clear by my very old friend the member for O'Connor, who, at the doors this morning was asked by journalists - and, I can see, there is the member for O'Connor, back in town - whether voting against the Fair Work Bill would damage the Liberal Party's credibility with voters, seeing that the Leader of the Opposition had said that Work Choices was dead. Faced with this proposition - his leader had said Work Choices was dead but he obviously wanted to vote against the Fair Work Bill - what did the member for O'Connor say? He said:I think we've got to realise that the party went through a period when decisions were being taken outside of the party room.Last week in this chamber I joked that the member for O'Connor would get his turn as Leader of the Opposition. Well, we do not need to wait for it, because the member for O'Connor is already calling the shots from the back bench, causing the Leader of the Opposition to backflip from his December position in the interests of short-term political opportunism and his own job.As fond as I am of the member for O'Connor, I actually think the true motivating force - An honourable member interjecting -  - He may have got that right, actually. But as fond as I want to be of the member for O'Connor, I think the true motivating force behind this change in position is not actually the member for O'Connor; it is the member for Higgins. And what do we know about the member for Higgins's position on unfair dismissals? - The member for Higgins in late 2005 outlined his views on unfair dismissals where in respect of the exemption under Work Choices, the 100 limit, he said:I can't tell you there is any magic in the number 100.He went on - 'If this were to work well and people were to say: ... in the years to come it should be extended to all companies _ I would be very open to the idea.There we have it. The real political position of the Liberal Party, which will ultimately be imposed on the Leader of the Opposition on the question of unfair dismissals, is very clear. In the middle of a global recession, the Liberal Party's answer to that global recession is to make Australian workers easier to sack.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his interesting question. The first part of his question was: do I agree with the minister for small business that he has the balance right? The answer is yes. The second part of my answer to the honourable member's question is as follows. One of the reasons why the minister and the government have got the balance right is because we believe that all workers should have a right to redundancy. We believe that Work Choices should not be allowed to strip away redundancy entitlements. We believe we have the balance right because we believe that all workers should have the right to be properly compensated for and provided with public holidays, with overtime payments and penalty rates. These things were all stripped away by the legislation which the member for Ryan voted for in the last parliament. He stripped away protections for redundancy payments, overtime payments, penalty rates and public holidays when he voted for Work Choices in the previous parliament.My point to the member for Ryan and the people he associates with on this matter is simply this: does he support the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition that Work Choices is dead? Does he support the Leader of the Opposition, who said that the government has a mandate to proceed with its implementation of unfair dismissal laws for small business? Does he support that or is he remaining mute and silent on this question? It seems that the position taken by the Leader of the Opposition increasingly swings in the breeze on this.The member for O'Connor made a very interesting observation at the doors this morning. Basically, it was all about this: the Leader of the Opposition went out there - ahead of the party room, ahead of the member for Higgins - in making these proclamations that Work Choices was dead and that the government had a mandate to proceed with its proposed changes to unfair dismissal laws. That is it in a nutshell. What we have seen, I think, is a very pathetic spectacle in the parliament today: the Leader of the Opposition being reined in not just on climate change, not just on Work Choices and not just, as we have already seen, on economic stimulus strategies, but right across the board. In fact, what we have seen on the part of the opposition is policy development paralysed by the opportunism which arises from its own internal leadership conflict.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. We are witnessing the biggest global downturn in living memory. The major advanced economies are officially in recession, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and much of the European area. The World Bank and the IMF now expect that global growth will fall below zero this year for the first time since the Second World War. As the government has consistently said, Australia is much better placed to resist these overwhelmingly negative economic forces coming from the global economy, but we cannot resist these forces completely. It is not good enough for the Australian government to simply sit back and allow the consequences of the global economic slowdown to wash through the Australian economy unresisted. That is why there has been significant progress that we can applaud at this weekend's G20 finance ministers meeting in London. Their communique stated:We have taken decisive, coordinated and comprehensive action to boost demand and jobs, and are prepared to take whatever action is necessary until growth is restored.                _            _            _Fiscal expansion is providing vital support for growth and jobs. Acting together strengthens the impact and the exceptional policy actions announced so far must be implemented without delay. We are committed to deliver the scale of sustained effort necessary to restore growth _As members will already know, the government has taken decisive action, both through its Economic Security Strategy towards the end of last year and, at the beginning of this year, the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. We have made it plain and we have been quite honest with the Australian people that these strategies cannot resist all of the impacts of the global recession, but we are committed to doing everything possible in order to minimise those impacts on Australian working people and Australian businesses.I would like to quote a few effective endorsements for this strategy from a variety of sources. The IMF on 6 March said, 'Given the depth of the crisis, avoiding or postponing action is not a viable option.' The Chairman of the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, testifying to the US Senate on 3 March, said:We are better off moving aggressively today to solve our economic problems; the alternative could be a prolonged episode of economic stagnation that would not only contribute to further deterioration in the fiscal situation, but would also imply lower output, employment, and incomes for an extended period.Referring to the government's stimulus packages, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, said on 20 February:Growth will be stronger than it would have been without those actions. I do not think there is any doubt about that.            _         _         _I trust, hope and expect that the main ramification is going to be that the path of the Australian economy is going to be considerably better than it would otherwise have been, and considerably better than a number of other countries around the world whom we can see contracting at a very large pace.Yesterday, a very important voice was added to these voices indicating that the path of significant stimulus - to generate and sustain growth and jobs - is the right path. That is, of course, President Obama of the United States, who, according to AAP, at a press conference, supported the need for major stimulus actions throughout the major economies of the world and, in doing so, cited Australia as a specific example of a nation that was doing the right thing in stimulating economic activity, in supporting jobs and growth.Unfortunately, there is one significant element of the picture that does not quite get it, and that, of course, is the opposition, who believes that we should just sit there and wait and see what happens. Clearly, one would have to speculate that there is something of a political consideration in the assessment by the Leader of the Opposition. His hope is that things deteriorate, and that changes the political calculus. He is choosing to gamble with the jobs and the livelihoods of Australian workers and Australian businesses. Unfortunately, that gamble has a serious set of implications for the Australian economy and for jobs and growth generally. It is a gamble that we as the Australian government cannot afford to take. We cannot afford to sit back and allow the consequences of the global recession to knock Australian businesses and Australian workers for six. We are committed as a government to stimulating economic activity, to supporting jobs, to supporting growth - as are other governments around the world, particularly the United States government and President Obama.</DOC>

 - I was with the Queensland Premier yesterday when she conducted the official launch of the Labor Party's campaign for the Queensland state election. I fully support the Premier's efforts to create jobs in the Queensland economy through an infrastructure package. She stands in stark contrast to Mr Springborg, the Leader of the Opposition, whose policy is to cut 12,000 jobs in Queensland by a $1 billion reduction in outlays in the state budget. Queensland Labor is standing for what you do to support jobs in the Queensland economy; the state opposition stands for a policy of cutting another 12,000 jobs. The contrast could not be clearer.</DOC>

 - This government understands that the housing and construction sector is critical to our economy; indeed, it employs about nine per cent of all employed Australians. That is why, as part of our economic stimulus measures, we have taken two very important policy steps to support jobs in this area. The first is through the first home owner boost in the economic stimulus strategy, and the second is the increased spending on social housing in the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. The member for Forde has told me, because he is very much in touch with builders, developers, real estate agents and others who have their fingers on the pulse in his electorate of Forde, that the measures are already having a clear effect in his area. Indeed, one of the principals of Dixon Realty in Jimboomba, Jeff Dixon, told the member for Forde that he estimates that upwards of 80 per cent of home sales under $400,000 in the Forde electorate are directly related to the government's first home owners grant. Mr Jason Luckhardt from AVP Realty in Beenleigh told the member for Forde that, having experienced a 60 per cent drop in sales, the first home owner boost has seen first home buyers returning to the market in the same sort of numbers that were present before the global financial crisis. Mr David Manfield from Heritage Realty Queensland told the member for Forde that he believes the first home owner boost:... has turned the market around. The flow-on travels throughout the whole market and building game.Commentators from around Australia are saying that the first home owner boost has been successful. Last week, Westpac Senior Economist, Andrew Hanlon told ABC Radio:Lending to that segment has jumped sharply - up 60 per cent in five months. Finance approvals for the construction of new dwellings has also lifted sharply in the last couple of months, and that will certainly be a positive for housing construction. - It is interesting to hear the government talking about a first home owner boost and the opposition talking about extending something. I thought they were now opposed to the Economic Security Strategy. They are opposed to it now. They want to extend something that they are out in the community trashing, saying that it is having no practical effect on employment. It is absolutely extraordinary. After 10 years of no action in housing, they are now talking about extending our measures at the same time as they are out in the community trashing those same measures. To get back to Andrew Hanlon, he said on the ABC:It is certainly clear that demand for housing finance has been in recovery for five months. And it comes as no surprise, given the change in interest rates and the federal government's incentive for first home buyers.Of course, that is leading to strong employment outcomes in the building sector and, we heard last week, in the banking sector. But as the Adelaide Advertiser said in its editorial on Saturday:Helping first-home buyers into the market has a multiplier effect. Homeowners are more likely than renters to spend money on gardening, furniture, hardware, white goods, carpets, paints, security systems and a myriad of other products.Of course, our action does not end with the first home owner boost. We are building 20,000 new social housing dwellings and we are doing substantial repairs to 10,000 dwellings and minor repairs to almost 40,000 dwellings. All of those measures support building jobs. In coming weeks I expect to announce the first new construction projects under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan to build at least 2,300 new homes. By August this year, we will have completed the tender process for stage 3 of the funding for completely new homes to be built, with $5.3 billion worth of investment from the federal government.Project bids are already coming in from around the country. Less than six weeks after the Nation Building and Jobs Plan was announced, the government have been working with the states and territories. We have started the ball rolling on the largest tender and procurement process for social housing in the history of this nation. It is not business as usual. We have said to the states and territories that we expect them to work with builders and developers to look at what they have in the pipeline and proportions of new developments to be bought for social housing. We want to see 75 per cent of all of that work completed by the end of next year.The first home owners boost, the new social housing initiative and all of these other programs support jobs for builders, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, architects, project managers, bricklayers, tilers, carpet layers, concreters and plasterers; and they also support the industries that supply the materials, including bricks, timber, carpet, windows and whitegoods. All of those employment outcomes are because of our spending, our first home owners boost and our social housing initiative.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition, he who says that Work Choices is dead - but it seems not for today. In response to the honourable member's question, which goes to comments from the Australian Industry Group, as the honourable member knows, the AiG and the government, through the Deputy Prime Minister, have been engaged in long-term negotiations over aspects of the industrial relations legislation. These have been important and substantive, and have produced good outcomes in terms of getting the balance right, in terms of what firms need and in terms of what employees need as well. Furthermore, on one of the matters to which AiG refers, I would simply say that on the question of arbitration - the resort to what is described by some as compulsory arbitration - our view is that the provisions and the protections contained in the legislation get the balance right, and the circumstances and the conditionalities are attached to them. That is important. We believe that is the right way to go.Similarly, on the other question the AiG raised on the transfer of business, we are acutely conscious of the complexities which are alive in that and we are also acutely conscious of what happens when the ownership of a firm transfers from one to the other and what happens with the pre-existing industrial relations arrangements contained within a pre-existing enterprise agreement. There has been extensive consultation on these matters between the government and the AiG. We believe we have got the balance right. There is always room for disagreement. But we believe that when it comes to the overall balance, Australians want a government with legislation to protect the interests of working families on things like redundancy, penalty rates and overtime payments. That is where the balance lies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I know that he is very interested from the point of view of his electorate in these education developments, particularly including trade training centres. The government are in favour of supporting Australian jobs through economic stimulus. We always have been. Those on the other side have had so many positions I have lost count, but they voted against supporting Australian jobs when they voted against the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Just on the question of consistency, on this side of the House, we have always been opposed to Work Choices. On that side of the House, they introduced Work Choices, and what we have learnt during question time today is that no-one should listen to the words of the Leader of the Opposition because they are without worth and without meaning. The Liberal Party today has said, once again through its questions, that they are the party of Work Choices and they always will be. - It is interesting to me that it is the shadow Treasurer, the salesperson for Work Choices, who interjects. On this side of the House, we believe in an education revolution and quality schooling for Australian children. On the other side of the House, the Liberal Party are opposed to it and voted against it. They voted against an economic stimulus package to support jobs around the country. They voted against the single biggest school modernisation program this country has ever seen. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is shouting out how opposed she is to this modernisation. But right around the country primary schools are looking forward to participating and being able to modernise their facilities with new multipurpose halls and 21st century libraries, and replacing demountable classrooms with permanent classrooms at last. Secondary schools around the country are looking forward to and are in the process of engaging with new science labs and language labs - 500 of those to be built. Schools around the country are already working on getting their applications in for the National School Pride program - $1.3 billion of investment in small repairs and maintenance that every school needs.In addition to these developments, through our economic stimulus package, in order to support jobs around the country and to have the single biggest modernisation of Australian schools ever done in this country, we have brought forward funding of $110 million for our $2.5 billion trades training centre scheme. This means that round 2 of the scheme, which is in progress now, is for a huge $387 million which will be available for building trade training centres in Australian schools. This is an important part of our stimulus package, an important part of building the careers and skills pathways for the future. I am excited about this development because I have had the opportunity to talk to schools around this country about how well received the first round of trade training centres was. I had the opportunity very recently to announce the successful schools for the second phase of round 1 - 336 schools around the country participated in this proposal with 104 projects.Members opposite stand opposed to these developments and, in doing so, they stand opposed to developments like the Grand Junction Construction Industry Trade Training Centre, which, in order to give kids who want these vocational pathways, will provide training and support in construction and the property services industry. They are opposed to this development of $4 million. Which school is the lead school for that development? It is St Paul's College in the electorate of Sturt - a school very excited with this development to which the Liberal Party are opposed. On this side of the House, no matter what inconsistencies we see from the Liberal Party, we will be there supporting economic stimulus, jobs around the country, the biggest school modernisation program the country has ever seen and the ability to participate in trades training around the country.</DOC>

 - The honourable member's question goes to the impact of the stimulus measures on jobs, specifically within Australia. The alternative - and the dividing line between us in this parliament - is as clear as day. The Liberal Party stands for sitting, waiting and doing nothing; this government has a clear plan of action.The member for Fadden then left the chamber. - In response to the honourable member for Aston's question: jobs are the explicit focus of what we have done by way of support payments for pensioners, carers and veterans, because consumption is critical for the 1½ million Australians who are employed in the retail sector. He asked for evidence of its impact. Retail trade rose by 3.8 per cent in December 2008. It grew further, by 0.2 per cent, in January. In December, retail trade figures in Canada fell by 5.4 per cent. In the United States they fell by three per cent. In Japan they fell by 1.9 per cent. In Germany they fell by 0.9 per cent. In New Zealand they fell by one per cent. The clear contrast between retail sales in this economy and those in other economies in the December quarter and into January is clear for all to see. What, it seems, is very difficult for the member for Aston to see is that if retails sales are up then that supports employment in the retail sector. I know that is a difficult connection for him to make but, in terms of the 1½ million Australians who are employed in the Australian retail industry, if he were to reflect on the numbers that we saw in the collapse of retail in other economies around the world, he would have seen many more Australians out of work in the retail sector.The second part of the stimulus package, which he draws to our attention in terms of the impact of the stimulus package on jobs, is in the housing sector. Again, I would draw the honourable member's attention to the most recent housing figures out in Australia which are as a consequence of the first home owners boost. For the honourable member's attention, in the scheme's first 3½ months of operation there were 10,000 applicants for the first home owners boost in New South Wales, 5,800 in Victoria, 6½ thousand in Queensland, 2,800 in Western Australia and 2,400 in South Australia. These figures are the direct result of government policy through the government's stimulus package - altogether 30,000 homes being built as a result of government policy. So I say to the member for Aston: do 30,000 homes get built with anyone working on them? I know it is a hard question. Can you build 30,000 homes with pixies in the bottom of the garden saying, 'Poof! There's a house' - with nobody building it? It takes a lot of people to build a house. It takes brickies, it takes carpenters, it takes sparkies and it takes people in the transport industry to build 30,000 homes. - If the member for Aston would spend more time reading these statistics than he does acting as campaign director for the member for Higgins, he would be more familiar with what is actually going on in the Australian economy as a direct result of government policy.Also on the housing policy and the first home owners boost, can I draw attention to the great intervention just before by the member for Cook. The member for Cook comes to the dispatch box obviously with a carefully thought out cunning plan to interject -  - On the question of the stimulus package and its impact on jobs and housing - employment in the housing sector being so critical to overall employment in the Australian economy - here again we have had on display a wonderful flip-flop-flap on housing policy. First, those opposite originally said they supported the first home owners boost; second, they said they opposed the first home owners boost; and, third, today the member for Cook gets up and says he wants to extend the first home owners boost. What remarkable consistency! What I would say to those opposite is: work out the connection between boosted retail sales and jobs and between increased first home owners housing stats and jobs. The conclusions are there for all to see - that is, other than those who spend all their time on the internal leadership machinations of the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question - she, like many on this side of the House, is very determined to make sure that the action taken by the government is upheld in this parliament. Members would probably be aware that the Senate committee looking into the alcopops excise measure reported today to the Senate. The debate is being undertaken today in the Senate, and we anticipate that there will be a vote on this measure today or tomorrow. We hope that the Senate will be looking at the clear evidence that was presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which shows not only the sales data from the Australian Tax Office but also the very wide support for the government having taken action on this measure. This support has come from the AMA, the Public Health Association, the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the Australian National Council on Drugs, as well as experts commissioned by the previous Howard government. They have all backed this measure.If the Liberal Party really do care about binge drinking and about health policy, they should be making sure that Liberal senators vote for this bill. Of course we know that if the bill does not pass in the Senate it will only be a number of weeks before we have teenage girls back using their pocket money to pay those low prices for lolly water drinks that the Liberal Party have stood next to every step of the way.The new development today, in addition to the Senate committee report, is that the Leader of the Opposition came out today and said that he is going to vote both for and against this measure. He has taken the extremely logical view that this is going to be, and should be, a tax that is good for 12 months - during which time it will be supported - but not good for the following 12 months, during which time it should not be supported. This is not a sustainable position for the Leader of the Opposition; however, it does seem to be quite consistent with what he has been doing on everything else; it is consistent with supporting the Economic Security Strategy and then opposing it, and it is consistent with saying that Work Choices is dead and then thinking that he is now going to vote to keep it in place. Today, we saw the latest one of those: the homeowners grant that the Liberal Party opposed and that they are now going to be back into. We have got the Leader of the Opposition faced with a choice of whether he will vote for or against, and he wants to do both.Obviously, this is not a sustainable position, but, perhaps even more embarrassing for the Leader of the Opposition is that he has today done a Julie Bishop. He has come out and said that he has a new policy. The new policy is that they will vote for this legislation for 12 months and that they will vote against it for the following 12 months. People might think that the Leader of the Opposition promoted this as a new idea of his own. In fact, he stole it directly from the distillers - it is exactly the position the distillers put in their letter to the Senate inquiry only a week ago. This is plagiarism by the Leader of the Opposition, who is not even able to think of his own policy ideas.But, in case anybody was not convinced that the Liberal Party had lost all credibility on this issue, we have to also go today to the member for Dickson. The member for Dickson went out today to the media and said that he had a really good idea. He went out this morning and said that he thought binge drinking was such a problem that we should have a national advertising campaign against it. And I thought: 'That's a really good idea! That is such a good idea that we have actually already implemented it!' We have already - last year - had a $20 million advertising campaign on television, in magazines and in our newspapers, and the only person who has not noticed is the member for Dickson. I mean, this is completely ridiculous. Today or tomorrow, the Liberal Party will have the opportunity to vote for or against this measure - they will not be able to do both - and the weights are on them whether they want teenage girls to be able to buy these drinks for their pocket money prices.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I am pleased to be able to advise him, through you, Mr Speaker, that the National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil and Other Noxious and Hazardous Substances has been activated - it kicks in automatically. It was activated last week, and it is a matter of some concern to me that the member is so poorly informed about this issue and chooses to politicise it in the House. The fact of the matter is that Australia has a national plan to enable effective responses to marine pollution. It is a fact that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority - within my colleague Minister Albanese's portfolio - manages that national plan. It is also a fact that the Rudd government announced today that it will immediately bring forward $2 million to help local community groups and natural resource management bodies to continue the clean-up of Moreton Bay following last week's oil spill.I want to go on and say to the member that I have been in contact not only with my department but also with the Queensland government on this particular issue and that we have looked very closely and carefully at the measures that have been put in place. The Commonwealth response was one which was immediate, constructive and comprehensive. I also want to point out that today my colleague the Attorney-General announced that we will deploy a Royal Australian Navy minehunting vessel to search for 31 fertiliser containers which were lost from the Pacific Adventurer during tropical Cyclone Hamish on 11 March. The Commonwealth's response has been absolutely clear. We acted immediately and consistently with our responsibilities. I am surprised that a question of this kind would be asked in the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. The Australian financial system does not have the same problem with toxic assets that the American and European financial systems do, but we are indirectly affected by that problem. In particular, there is a risk that foreign lenders in the Australian economy will withdraw their funding because of problems in their home markets, not because of problems with the businesses that they are lending to in Australia.In order to protect the Australian economy and to protect jobs, the Australian government is putting in place a mechanism that is designed to ensure against that risk, and that is the Australian Business Investment Partnership, which involves an investment on behalf of the taxpayer of $2 billion, matched by an equivalent amount from the four major Australian banks. That will be there to ensure that we can invest, if and when necessary, in order to provide for circumstances where foreign banks that in normal circumstances would continue lending to Australian enterprises take their money in order to return to their home front.This will offer liquidity support for major commercial property projects that are in existence or underway. It does involve some exposure to risk on the part of the taxpayer - we have been quite upfront about that - but there are a number of things in place designed to minimise that risk. First, as I indicated, it is a fifty-fifty partnership with the four major banks and lending can only occur if there is a unanimous decision of all five parties - the four banks and the federal government. Second, there will be some provision made at the outset for bad and doubtful debts. Third, there will be an arrangement to ensure that, where any lending occurs, the existing investments of the major banks have to also stay in place. Fourth, detailed prudent lending requirements will be put in place. Fifth, and most importantly, this facility will only be available for a two-year period, so any lending decision must occur within the next two years.The reason we have to do this is that, if this risk is not protected against, there is a serious risk of fire sales, of a wave of negative impacts rippling through the commercial property sector. In order that we can protect against that, it is necessary to provide this facility in case foreign lenders decide to withdraw funding for what would otherwise be commercially viable businesses. This is an extraordinary measure. That is clear. But it is an extraordinary measure in the face of extraordinary circumstances.There is one central reason that the government is undertaking this extraordinary measure and that is to sustain and protect jobs. There are something like 150,000 Australian jobs connected to the commercial property sector - white-collar jobs and blue-collar jobs. If we see a pattern of withdrawal of financing and fire sales, those jobs will be seriously under threat. The financing of the commercial property sector and the pricing of commercial properties are connected to much of the Australian economy, and the contagion that might follow from a major collapse of pricing in that sector would have very serious ramifications indeed.I am asked about the community response, the wider response, to the government's initiative. I would like to mention a few examples of this. The first is from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who told the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics only a few weeks ago:I do not have any problem with there being a plan in the top drawer to do that should it be needed. -  - That was the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who attracts mirth and general derision from the opposition benches. The second response is from the Property Council:The Property Council urges bi-partisan support for this legislation to inject stability and confidence into the economy.ABIP is an essential mechanism to inject stability and confidence into commercial property lending.                         _                   _                   _This will protect the lending collateral for Australian small businesses, whose jobs and productivity will help lead us out of this economic slump.Next is Master Builders Australia. Sneer at them as well, why don't you, while you are on the way through. They said:Master Builders Australia ... has called for bipartisan support for the early passing of the Australian Business Investment Partnership Limited Bill.Ian Harper from Access Economics said:In normal times, the Government ought have no business lending to property or to anything else, but these are extraordinary times.                         _                   _                   _If there is a major collapse in asset prices in the commercial property market, that could feed through into domestic housing.Given the exposure of domestic banks to housing ... that is what we're trying to avoid at all costs.Predictably enough, there is one voice in the community reaction that does not go along with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Property Council, the Master Builders or indeed Access Economics. Once again, it is the Liberal and National opposition who have indicated their opposition to this very important measure to sustain employment and growth in the Australian economy. The Leader of the Opposition said in response to this:The market should take its course.In other words: 'Let's just take the risk that we will see widespread collapses in commercial property prices, that we'll see thousands of jobs lost, that we'll see a serious withdrawal of foreign funding from this sector and major negative ripple-on ramifications for the Australian economy.' Yet again, that is the position of the opposition. The government does not believe that is the right approach. The right approach is to act. When the Australian economy is threatened, when jobs are threatened and when businesses are threatened, the Rudd government will take decisive action to protect those businesses and to protect those jobs.</DOC>

 - All of the figures that I have heard the honourable member quote are simply incorrect. They are just simply wrong. I can tell you that the Air Security Officer Program has not been cut significantly. -  - I can tell you that the Australian Federal Police have not cut staff significantly. Indeed, the staffing figures remain very similar now to what they were at this time last year. I can tell you that the Australian Crime Commission's employment fluctuates according to the particular projects that are underway and according to whether the officers that are seconded from other police forces are appropriately employed at a particular time. The fact is that the figures quoted by the honourable member are simply incorrect and we are not losing any officials from these organisations at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for his question, and I acknowledge his work on the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and that of other members as well. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation today marks its 60th anniversary as Australia's national intelligence agency. The 21st century security environment is extremely complex and the work of ASIO has never been more important. Since its creation in 1949 by the Chifley government, ASIO's brief has changed markedly, traversing the entire Cold War period and dealing with the rise of transnational terrorism, the emergence of the threat of home-grown terrorism and more recent developments in espionage, including in modern technology and the threat of cyberespionage to government and also to industry.Recent attacks in South Asia - one, of course, this month on the Sri Lankan cricket team - highlight the strategic character of the international campaign waged by violent extremists. Their targets of choice are innocent women and children and civilians. The arrest and conviction in Australia of would-be terrorists shows we are not isolated from those who would seek to perpetrate their horrendous acts of violence in this country, attacks that would obviously cause death and destruction but would also be enormously damaging to our tolerant multicultural society. The men and women of ASIO are working hard with other national security agencies to protect Australians and Australian interests. ASIO in fact has been at the forefront of efforts to ensure our national security agencies work as effectively as they possibly can and, in particular, work seamlessly together.Today I was honoured to mark the 60th anniversary of ASIO by planting a tree at the sight of their future headquarters. The 60th anniversary marks the time to acknowledge and pay respect to the service of the men and women of ASIO over the past 60 years and also to commit to the future. Today ASIO is an organisation of some 1,650 officers and this will build to around 1,800 officers by the year 2011 - a very substantial organisation, indeed - operating from that time from the state-of-the-art premises.Obviously, much of the quiet work undertaken by ASIO is, of necessity, never recognised in the public domain. While the men and women of ASIO will be acknowledging and celebrating the past, I know the men and women of ASIO will continue to discharge their vital role in protecting the interests of Australians and Australia both at home and abroad. I know all members of the House will join with me today in congratulating the men and women of ASIO on their 60th anniversary.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It goes to the question of how we deal with the challenge of climate change and, most particularly, how we deal with the future of the emissions trading scheme and how we deal, in turn, with the impacts of the emissions trading scheme, assuming it passes the Senate, in the real economy.On the question of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the government's plan is clear - that is, we believe in getting the balance right between serving the interests of our firms, our industries and our jobs, on the one hand, and doing the right thing by climate change on the other. This is a difficult task. We accept that fact, we accept that challenge and we are getting on with it. What the honourable Leader of the Opposition fails to appreciate is that failure to act on climate change actually destroys jobs in agriculture, tourism and elsewhere in the economy. - The honourable member refers to the impact of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme on the future of renewable energies in Australia. The whole function of introducing a carbon price into the economy is to encourage the development of renewable energy industries and, in turn, to generate further employment from it. - As the honourable Leader of the Opposition interjects about a scheme on which he campaigned to unseat the member for Bradfield as Leader of the Opposition, again I suggest to him that he should actually use some consistency in his approach. What the country expects of a government is consistency of approach on climate change. What the country expects is an approach which says, 'If you fail to act on climate change it destroys jobs in agriculture and tourism -  - I know why the Leader of the Opposition would not expect consistency, because reflecting on his own position there has not been one element of it. He used climate change and emissions trading politically to unseat the member for Bradfield as Leader of the Opposition when he said he was all for it and the member for Bradfield was all against it. Now that he is under threat by the member for Higgins he has changed his tune. Consistency is important. - I am happy that the member for Flinders intervened, because I seem to recall last year when we introduced the government's green paper, and then later our white paper, on emissions trading the honourable member for Flinders said something along the lines of: 'They have just copied our policy.' I appreciate the intervention from the honourable member for Flinders. He may be surprised to note that we actually pay some attention to what he says, because there has been a little more consistency - not a lot - in what he says compared with the Leader of the Opposition.On the impact of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme on employment, we are concerned to act because the job-destroying impact of climate change over time in agriculture in the Murray-Darling and in tourism across Australia will have a profound effect on the entire economy. Furthermore, by introducing a carbon price into the economy, we encourage the development of job-creating renewable industries across Australia. That is why we believe we have got the balance right in doing so. For example, on the employment impact of climate change, look at the number of people employed in agriculture in the Murray-Darling: 90,000 Australians. The Murray-Darling is a stressed river system because of overuse on the one hand and the impact of climate change on water going into the system on the other.I draw the honourable Leader of the Opposition's attention to what happens over time when you do not act appropriately on climate change. For example, modelling has been provided through the Garnaut review which indicates that, if nothing were done on climate change, the value of agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin would shrink by 12 per cent by 2030 and by 49 per cent by 2050. There are 90,000 Australians employed in the Murray-Darling. If you go to tourism, the same applies there. I draw the honourable member's attention to this fact in the renewable energy sector as well: Treasury modelling suggests that, under global action on climate change, most sectors of the Australian economy will grow and, in fact, many emissions-intensive industries will maintain or improve their competitiveness. Furthermore, if you look at the impact on the renewable energy sector, Treasury modelling says that the renewable energy sector will grow by 30 times its current size, creating thousands of jobs - an uncomfortable fact for those opposite. Furthermore, the International Energy Agency estimates that the additional investment in renewable energy by 2050 will be US$45 trillion, creating tens, hundreds of thousands and millions of jobs around the world.Therefore, the overall impact of introducing a carbon price is that over time we will see job generation coming out of the renewable energy sector. It is also necessary in order to underpin continued job generation in traditional sectors such as agriculture and tourism. This is the jobs dimension to what we do and I suggest that the honourable Leader of the Opposition show some consistency for the first time.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. I start by associating myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on the tragic death of an Australian soldier overnight in Afghanistan. Afghanistan remains a difficult and dangerous place, but the Australian government very strongly believes that it is in Australia's national interest and in the interests of the international community for Australia to continue both its military and its civil reconstruction commitment in Afghanistan. We have a direct stake in ensuring that Afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for international terrorists. Regrettably, in addition to the death of an Australian soldier overnight, we have in the past - indeed, in recent times - seen Australians at risk of international terrorism in Bali and more recently among members of the coaching staff and umpiring contingent for the Sri Lankan touring cricket team in Lahore in Pakistan.The Chief Government Whip asked me about Pakistan and the implications it has for Afghanistan. Pakistan is one of the most strategically important countries in the world: it is in South Asia, close to the Middle East, close to Central Asia and a nation which has nuclear weapons. It is important that we recognise Pakistan in its own right and also the implications that the Afghanistan-Pakistan border has for terrorist and extremist activity in Afghanistan. Having had the opportunity of personally seeing the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, one appreciates just how porous that border is and how there needs to be intense cooperation between the government of Pakistan, the government of Afghanistan and the international community through the United Nations and the International Security Assistance Force to address and counter terrorism in that area.We have seen the terrible recent atrocity against the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore. But as late as yesterday we saw another terrorist attack where up to eight people were killed in a terrorist attack in Rawalpindi - and we condemn that absolutely. On the other hand, overnight we have seen - and I welcome very much - the news that the government of Pakistan has decided to reinstate former Chief Justice Chaudhry and other members of the judiciary and has decided to review the ban on former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother so far as their political activity or engagement is concerned and has decided that those arrested in the course of the so-called Long March will be released. We have seen, as a consequence, that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has called off the Long March protest against the government. This has very considerably defused a political crisis in Pakistan.We welcome very much the defusing of that crisis and we urge the political parties in Pakistan to work together to move forward to jointly combat terrorism and extremism. It is quite clear that, whatever political differences the political parties may have in Pakistan, the common enemy is terrorism. As my colleague the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, David Miliband, said recently:Terrorism is a mortal threat to Pakistan - or, as I have put it, a threat to Pakistan's very existence, not just a matter for us to contemplate in terms of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.We do not underestimate the seriousness of the economic security and social challenges facing Pakistan at this time, which is why on my recent visit there I made it clear that Australia stands ready, willing and able to assist Pakistan in these difficult times while we are a founding ministerial member of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan which first met at the United Nations General Assembly in September last year.In addition to the Minister for Defence meeting with his colleagues in Krakow recently and in addition to the Prime Minister's forthcoming discussions with the President of the United States in The Hague on 31 March, I will be meeting with other foreign ministers to discuss the military and civil contribution that the international community can make to Afghanistan. This meeting of foreign ministers will be wider than NATO foreign ministers, wider than the International Security Assistance Force foreign ministers but will also include Afghanistan and Pakistan's neighbours, including Iran, which is an important new development which I welcome. I look very much forward to discussing with my colleagues the important challenges that Afghanistan and Pakistan face.Despite the risks, despite the difficulties and despite the tragic events that we have seen overnight it is absolutely in Australia's national interest to continue to do our bit, to play our part with our international colleagues in seeking to stare down the terrorist threat that we currently find in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area. There is no doubt that that border area is the current hotbed of international terrorism and all our resolve is required to stare that down in conjunction with our partners, our neighbours and our allies.</DOC>

 - On the question of the impact of the emissions trading scheme, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, as the government has proposed in regional Australia, the honourable member will be familiar with the structure of what the government has put forward - namely, a raft of assistance mechanisms for emissions-intensive trade-exposed sectors of the economy, a raft of assistance measures through the electricity supply industry in Australia, a raft of measures to assist other affected industries in the climate change adjustment fund, and a raft of measures to assist households in their adjustment. We believe that this set of measures provides an appropriate framework to assist economies in the transition to a lower carbon economy. It gets the balance right between acting for the environment and acting for jobs. We would ask those opposite to honour their previous commitments to get behind a positive piece of legislation for the economy, for the environment and for climate change for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question because we are in the middle of a global recession and that requires global solutions. The meeting at the weekend agreed to take whatever steps are necessary to restore growth. It is pretty fair to say that the meeting at the weekend was one of the most important G20 meetings that has ever been held. It made quite substantial progress in advance of the leaders' meeting in a couple of weeks time. It is worth focusing on why the finance ministers were so galvanised, if you like, at this meeting over the weekend, because the latest figures that are coming out on global growth are sobering. Indeed, figures presented at the meeting at the weekend show that, on an annualised basis, growth in the developed world went back seven per cent in the December quarter. What this demonstrates is just how difficult the global environment is at the moment and why there is such an urgent need for there to be international action.Four achievements stand out from the meeting over the weekend. The first one was that all of the 20 largest economies in the world are focused on dealing with the problem of toxic assets in the banking system. This is very important because it goes to the core of the ability of credit to flow globally and that then goes to the core issue of confidence in the international financial system. It is the case that the failure or inability of some governments to clean up these toxic assets, which we did not have in this country, but to clean them up elsewhere, is certainly restricting growth in domestic economies, slowing the world economy and then further eroding confidence in the international economy. It was good to see an agreement to a framework for international cooperation in this area which is based largely on proposals put forward by the Prime Minister. Our government put forward a set of proposals, as did the British government, and they were substantially adopted in the communique.Secondly, all of the 20 largest economies in the world agreed on the importance of economic stimulus, on the importance of fiscal stimulus -  - Yes, they did. Finance ministers from across the political divide understand the importance of boosting demand to avoid a damaging loss of output, much higher unemployment, much higher budget deficits and, of course, what follows from that: much higher debt. The conservative governments in the room put forward economic stimulus packages. Conservative governments in the room on the weekend were very strong advocates of economic stimulus - namely, the Germans, but also the French and many others. That was because all of the leaders in the room last weekend, all of the finance ministers, understand, unlike the Liberal and National parties in this country, that action is required early to boost demand to avoid more damaging outcomes in the long run. So the communique did strongly support economic stimulus, and it was signed up to by governments of all political persuasions from around the world, most of whom are putting in place substantial economic stimulus packages.Thirdly, the meeting agreed on the need for substantial reform of international financial institutions, most notably the IMF. Australia was the chair of that committee, along with South Africa, and those proposals are going forward to the leaders meeting. Fourthly, the meeting agreed to put forward a set of proposals to regulate and supervise international financial systems. These are very important. So there was a striking consensus across the developed and developing world and, as I said before, across governments of different stripes.There are only one or two parties around the world who do not think that these initiatives are important and who do not support economic stimulus. Of course, one or two of those parties sit here in the Australian parliament. They are a pretty select band. They are joined by the radical right of the Republican Party in the United States, but there are not many others, because around the world, irrespective of the political divide, governments understand that economic stimulus is critical in an environment where there has been a sudden drop or contraction in demand and that failure to act simply pushes up unemployment and causes a greater drop in output and therefore greater damage to the economy in the long run. All of those leaders said that not to act - to sit and wait and see, as those opposite advocate - is the height of irresponsibility. Their approach was certainly not supported by anyone in that room in the G20 over the weekend.It was an important meeting, and it sets the ground rules for the meeting in two weeks time. At that meeting, the Australian people can be assured that the Prime Minister and this government will be doing everything we possibly can to support an outcome that boosts global growth, that reforms our financial system and that supports employment. Internationally, the approach of those opposite - to 'sit and wait and see' - is rejected by every other major political party in the Western world and the developing world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for North Sydney, the minister for Work Choices, for his question. What I can say about the impact of a global recession is that the last thing Australian workers want now is the reintroduction of Work Choices. There the Liberal Party stand, led by the member for North Sydney, saying that what working families across Australia want now is Work Choices - Work Choices, which strips away redundancy payments; Work Choices, which strips away penalty rates; Work Choices, which strips away overtime; Work Choices, which strips away basic protections in the workplace. In a time of global recession, the free market fundamentalists opposite say that their solution for the future is to rip and tear away at the protections for Australians in the workplace.The government's strategy is clear. We will implement an economic stimulus strategy in order to reduce the impact of the global recession on Australian jobs. That is the government's plan. That is the government's strategy. That is what we are getting on with doing. I say this to the member for North Sydney: it is very easy to sit there and carp and be negative. It is very easy to tear down and not to build up -  - The member for North Sydney, the minister for Work Choices - and I presume he is part of that group within the Liberal Party which still wants to visit Work Choices upon the Australian community - Opposition members - No he didn't. - I thank the member for North Sydney and the former minister for Work Choices for his contribution to the debate. What is a live concern for everyone in the nation is when they will seek to bring Work Choices back, because Work Choices is in the Liberal Party DNA.Let us go to the three elements of the position put forward by the member for North Sydney in his question. The first is on economic stimulus. What they said when we introduced the economic stimulus plan was, 'We, the Liberal Party, support it.' Secondly, on the abolition of Work Choices what they have said is that Work Choices is dead. Thirdly, on the question of the emissions trading scheme, what did we have from the member for Flinders? When it came out in July last year, what did the member for Flinders say? He said:Basically, what they've done - that is, the government - is they've dusted off the document that we had.There you have those opposite saying that there is nothing different between them and us on emissions trading, saying that Work Choices is dead, supporting our economic strategy and trying to argue that somehow they have a credible basis on which to enter this debate today. Consistency, Joe, will help every day.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Data from the United States overnight continues to confirm the impact of the global recession on its national economy. In the month of February, industrial production in the United States fell a further 1.4 per cent, taking production down to its lowest level in seven years. Capacity utilisation in the United States has now fallen to 70.9 per cent, down from 71.9 per cent in January. This is now equal to the lowest capacity utilisation level in the United States ever recorded.Beyond the United States, we have received further confirmation of the way this global economic cyclone is hitting economies around the world. Canada has recorded a sharp jump in unemployment from 7.2 per cent to 7.7 per cent, and Italy has seen a fall in GDP of 1.9 per cent in the December quarter, its largest fall since contemporary records began in 1981. In Singapore, the largest fall in retail sales in a decade was recorded in January, with retail sales down by 12.2 per cent compared with last year. What these figures from the United States, from Canada, from Italy and from Singapore demonstrate is that this global recession is affecting every national economy. The key question within each national economy is, 'What are you going to do about it?' That is why the government has put forward its economic stimulus plan for the future, which is, firstly, based on us providing guarantees for bank deposits in order to underpin confidence in the Australia financial system; secondly, based on what we are also doing with support payments to pensioners, to carers, to veterans and to farmers in hardship, which will support the 1½ million Australians employed in the retail sector; and, thirdly, based on our investment in long-term infrastructure - our school modernisation plan as well as what we are doing in social housing and energy insulation.On the impact of the stimulus package - and I noticed those opposite are no longer asking us about the effect of the economic stimulus package - I draw the attention of those opposite to the minutes of the 3 March RBA board meeting, which were released today. - The chortling member for Aston might listen to this, as he was asking questions yesterday about the impact of the stimulus on activity in the economy. The RBA minutes say: 
_ retail spending had increased sharply in December, after a run of weak readings in previous months _ the higher level of December sales was maintained in January, with sales rising by a further 0.2 per cent.Further, the RBA attributed this rise to increases in household disposable income which were driven by 'lower lending interest rates, lower petrol prices and government transfer payments'. Moreover, the RBA noted that the government's second stimulus would provide further support for the economy. It went on to say:Looking at government finances, the Australian Government's fiscal package announced in February would provide significant stimulus to the economy over the next two years.That is from the Reserve Bank Board's meeting of 3 March. That goes to the heart of the relationship between the government's economic stimulus strategy and its impact on economic activity in Australia across the period ahead.The response to what the government has done is reflected by comments not just by a number of large retailers but also by small business operators in Australia. I note that support is coming in from Mildura, in the member for Mallee's electorate. Rob McKinnon from Fantastic Furniture in Mildura said, 'We have doubled our sales since Thursday and made $2,000 more than we did before Christmas.' Then you have Office Works in Mildura saying, 'March typically is a tough month in Mildura, but it is very encouraging and I think retail in general in Mildura is doing okay.' There will be different reports from different parts of the country over time. What I find interesting in the baying and howling from those opposite, though, is that they do not like any good news. You know why? Because they celebrate bad news. That is because they seek to take political advantage out of bad news. We are getting on with the business of providing an economic response to the global economic crisis; they continue in their attempt to take political advantage from the economic crisis. - The member for Sturt should vouch for each of the P&amp;C -  - The member for Sturt, in his electorate, should look at the impact of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan on each of the primary schools in his electorate. I say this to the member for Sturt, who is very quick to the dispatch box - why doesn't he come back and answer this? - does he oppose the grants going to each of the primary schools in the electorate of Sturt? -  -  -  - I take it, at least from the member for Sturt's vote in this House, that he does oppose every single grant to every primary school in his electorate of Sturt. In the absence of him saying no, I assume that is the case. I have referred to the impact in terms of retailers in Mildura, but also I would refer to what some major retailers have had to say most recently about the impact of the government's economic stimu-lus strategy. For example, Big W has seen a very positive sales trend. Michael Luscombe of Woolworths said on 17 March in the Daily Telegraph that the government's strategy:_ certainly resonated very strongly in Big W as families stocked up on everyday general merchandise such as kids clothing.What you have, therefore, is a stimulus felt by smaller retailers, by larger retailers and also, of course, by the range of measures which have gone into the housing sector, as the Minister for Housing has referred to at the dispatch box before. These measures to provide for payments to families, to carers, to pensioners and to veterans are all designed to support stimulus for the 1½ million jobs in the Australian retail sector, which those opposite do not care about.Beyond that, what are the government doing? We are investing in the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history. We are also investing in order to make Australian homes energy efficient by installing ceiling insulation in 2.7 million Australian homes. The government are investing in building 20,000 new units of social housing. The government are investing $1.2 billion in the Australian Rail Track Corporation. The government are bringing forward $700 million in a roads program - a Black Spot Program. The government are investing $1.6 billion in critical upgrades to university and TAFE infrastructure. The government's strategy is clear cut: an economic stimulus plan to support jobs now and to build the infrastructure Australia needs for the future. What we have instead from those opposite is a political strategy of 'wait and see and do nothing; hope it gets better' to take political advantage out of the global economic recession. We, the govern-ment, are getting on with the job.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question given his spectacular contribution to the debate yester-day in the House of Representatives where he called for an extension of the government's first home owners bonus - a little blip there in terms of opposition tactics, but never mind; let it be so recorded.The honourable member asks a question about the impact of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in various regions in Australia. The government - firstly, in relation to the emissions-intensive trade-ex-posed sector; secondly, in assisting the electricity industry through the Electricity Sector Adjustment Scheme; thirdly, through the climate change adjustment fund; and, fourthly, through an assistance package for households - has put in place a set of mechanisms to ease the transition to a less carbon-intensive economy. That is the right and responsible course of action.As the honourable member and any honest participant in this debate would know, those opposite had 12 years to get an emissions trading scheme right. Do I hear from those opposite a single word about why they waited 12 years to do nothing? It was because they did not believe in it, because they were simply climate change sceptics. That was until the member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition, decided to make his run for the leadership - and then there was an attack on the member for Bradfield over his position on climate change - dressing himself in pale green colours in order to obtain the leadership. Then we got an attack on the brown side by the member for Higgins; namely, the Leader of the Opposition in waiting. And what do we do? We track to the right; we track to the brown side of the argument.What people expect of governments or alternative governments in this country is consistency. We are getting on with the business of implementing an appropriate response to carbon pollution reduction. Those opposite are riddled with inconsistencies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question and report to the House that very good progress has been made in rolling out the Energy Efficient Homes package. This package will see the largest rollout of energy efficiency that we have ever had in Australia. It is a rollout of ceiling insulation and solar hot water, as the Prime Minister has just said, to up to 2.7 million Australian homes, slashing energy costs by up to 40 per cent. I am pleased to advise the House that we have received over 2,000 applications for insulation and solar hot water and that the call centre has already received over 33,000 calls. This shows that there is great and enthusiastic interest from Australians who want to take action on energy efficiency and householders who want to save money on energy bills and reduce their carbon footprint.This is also good for supporting Australian jobs. I note that Bradford Insulation are looking to fill over 70 vacancies as a direct result of the stimulus package, ranging from national accounts managers through to plant operators. NSW Insulation estimate they will create an additional 100 job opportunities over three branches as a direct result of the stimulus package, and those positions are already being filled. This year the Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand simply said:The federal government's stimulus package is very welcome and timely. The insulation initiative will help to save and grow local jobs during difficult economic times.I note that, on 6 March in the Daily Telegraph, the General Manager of Dux Hot Water, Les Patterson, said -  -  - I appreciate that members opposite recognise the significance of Mr Patterson's name, but the fact is that as the General Manager of Dux Hot Water, he said:The enhanced solar hot water rebate will create countless new manufacturing and installation jobs _ It will also support the jobs of tradespeople at a critical time - particularly those who have been recently displaced from mines and other employment.This is a nation-building and jobs plan and this is the plan that the Liberal and National parties tried to block. They have been knocking it ever since and they are knocking it in the House this afternoon. But the fact is that this is a plan that delivers jobs. It delivers jobs through a package which not only enables local industry to get out there and put ceiling insulation in the roofs of Australian houses and solar hot water systems on the roofs of Australian homes but also produces low-pollution jobs and local jobs and delivers on our election promises in a way that the opposition can only dream about. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - The clear alternative in the Queensland election is that Labor stands for jobs and the Liberals and Nationals stand for job cuts. It is as simple as that. They do not like the fact that the Liberal National Party leader in Queensland, Mr Springborg, the job destroyer, has said that he will abolish a billion dollars from the budget and sack 12,000 public servants engaged in service delivery. That is the contrast between Labor, with an infrastructure plan to invest in the future in Queensland, and the Liberals and Nationals in Queensland, who are dedicated to sacking 12,000 workers. That is the clear contrast - jobs versus job cuts - and those sitting on the front bench of the Liberal Party should reflect long and hard on the impact of pulling a billion dollars out of a state budget and where that flows through in terms of job cuts. So I say to the honourable member for Fadden: when it comes to jobs and the alternative, it is absolutely clear-cut that, when you look at Mr Springborg's policy, it is nothing short of job destruction 101 - sacking 12,000 workers. If you have a problem with unemployment through the global recession, the Liberal National Party response is: add to that unemployment by making another 12,000 unemployed. That is simply wrong, wrong, wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and know that he is deeply concerned about ensuring fairness for Australian workers. As I have outlined to the House in the past, before the last election the Labor Party took a very clear policy on workplace relations to the Australian people. I know those opposite find that hard to understand - actually telling the Australian people the truth about what you are going to do on workplace relations - but we did. And very clearly in that policy were Labor's plans for new unfair dismissal laws where we said, if elected, we would put in place unfair dismissal arrangements, with special arrangements for small businesses - businesses with fewer than 15 employees - and general arrangements for businesses with 15 and above. Those arrangements get the balance right.For smaller businesses with fewer than 15 employees, counting full-time employees, part-time employees and regular and systematic casuals, small business owners will have a full 12 months to look at a new worker and to assess whether or not they fit into their business - a full 12 months. Then, of course, they will have procedural assistance if, at some time, they do need to deal with an underperformance issue with that worker or a dismissal issue in the form of our fair dismissal code. Bigger businesses - 15 and above - will have a full six months to see whether or not an employee fits into their business. This gets the balance right.On the question of the number, why was the number 15 selected and why was the system of counting full-time, part-time and regular and systemic casuals used? It was to equate the system with the longstanding feature of workplace relations that small businesses with fewer than 15 employees are not obligated by the award system to pay redundancy pay - to keep the definition standard across redundancies and across unfair dismissals.I am asked about there being any alternative proposals that strip away the rights of working Australians, and an amendment being pursued by the Liberal Party does just that. First, it changes the benchmark for these unfair dismissal arrangements for small businesses from fewer than 15 employees to 25 employees on a full-time effective equivalent - something that is contrary to Labor's election policy, contrary to our mandate and something we will not support. More amazingly still, it changes the definition of who gets redundancy pay from the standard current definition of fewer than 15 on a head count to fewer than 15 full-time effective equivalents. What does that mean? If you were an employee of nine years service and you worked in a business with 10 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees, and each of those part-time employees worked two days a week, today under the award system you would be entitled to redundancy pay if you were made redundant, and being a worker of nine years service you would be entitled to 16 weeks redundancy pay. If the opposition's amendment were accepted then that business would not reach the threshold of 15 full-time equivalent employees and that worker would have no redundancy entitlement at all. Today: entitled to 16 weeks pay; under the Liberal amendment: entitled to nothing. The Liberal Party is the party in government that ripped off redundancy pay. Now it is seeking to do the same in opposition.The Leader of the Opposition has tried in this debate to hunt with the hounds and run with the foxes. He has tried to be out there in the mainstream media saying to the Australian people, 'Work Choices is dead; nothing to do with me; I'm a reasonable man,' whilst at the same time in his party room going: 'Bring Work Choices on. I support it because I am as strong on Work Choices as Peter Costello.' Well, today is the day that opportunism ran out of rope. Let every Australian worker, particularly those who work for small businesses, understand that today the Leader of the Opposition and his Liberal Party have drafted an amendment and committed themselves to supporting an amendment that rips redundancy pay off hardworking employees. Mr Speaker, if you have made a fortune at Goldman Sachs then maybe 16 weeks pay is not very much, but for average hardworking Australians it is a fortune, and they are the people the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip off. -  - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I do genuinely thank the member for his question. Can I explain to the member that there are schools in every electorate in this country. Some of them have good members of parliament, who came into this chamber and voted for the single biggest school modernisation project in Australian history. Some of them did what he did and voted against it. - On the question of good members of parliament, who support school modernisation and who supported the single biggest infrastructure investment in schools in this nation's history: we are obviously rolling out that program and rolling it out quickly. Consequently, a lot of information is going to schools. - Obviously, this is a huge program, a $14 billion program, voted against by the opposition. It is being rolled out quickly across the country. When it is being rolled out quickly across the country, there are obviously times where there are information gaps and problems at local schools. -  - What good members of parliament - as opposed to the incompetents yelling at me - do -  - is go and sort those problems out. - The member for Petrie is a good member of parliament. - Indeed, she is such a good member of parliament she not only sorts out problems with schools in her electorate but out of the goodness of her heart goes and sorts out problems with schools in the electorates of the incompetents opposite. - I would have thought that the member for Dickson would have sent a thankyou note to the member for Petrie for getting this problem resolved for one of his local schools.The member for Dickson then left the chamber. - The member for Petrie sorted out an issue. Obviously, people would not have turned to the member for Dickson to do it because he is opposed to the whole program. At this point we should have the Hansard record that the member for Dickson is probably the only member ever to come into this parliament, in all of its history, to try and stop one of his schools getting funding and to complain when a problem has been sorted out for his school. Can I say to every member of the parliament: this program is being rolled out for every school in this country. The guidelines are publicly available. Yes, there will be times when schools want advice, want assistance, want someone to come and give them a helping hand. Members on this side of the House are always prepared to do that. Those over there, if they were truthful, would walk into the school and say: 'I am opposed to you getting this money. Goodbye.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. I know that many members on this side of the House are anxiously watching the proceedings in the other chamber. There have been developments today, with both the Greens senators and Senator Xenophon indicating that they will support this measure. But unfortunately we still have the Liberal Party, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, opposing this bill. Very recently the Liberal Party in the Senate have indicated that they will oppose the alcopops measure. I have to say that this has now come to a point where the Leader of the Opposition has shown an absolute lack of any moral leadership on an issue that is a scourge across the country.As a result of his failure and the Liberal Party's failure to show any skerrick of moral leadership on this issue, if this matter is not passed then in just a few short weeks we will have teenage girls and teenage boys again able to buy alcopops for pocket-money prices - again drinking sweet and sugary drinks that are targeted at them. What is more, the Leader of the Opposition's mates, the distillers, will get a tax break in the next four years of about $1.6 billion-plus. You have to ask yourself: what values does a leader have who opposes a measure like this? What kind of values compel the Leader of the Opposition to give a tax break to multinational alcohol companies that are selling sugary drinks to teenage girls? What sort of moral compass does the Leader of the Opposition have?I want to read you some of the opinions of health experts who, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, are all too aware of the human cost of alcopops. Let me quote first of all the President of the AMA, Dr Rosanna Capolingua. She says:We have to look at the alcohol industry and how it targets young people with alco-pops. It builds brand loyalty and the kids connect with a type of drink - they're hooked in.Then they go off and have an accident, or they're king hit while waiting in a queue outside a tavern, or they're raped or are having unprotected sex.Those are the words of the President of the AMA. I can quote Geoff Munro, the Director of the Community Alcohol Action Network. Again, he is someone all too aware of the human cost of alcohol abuse - something that the Leader of the Opposition has refused to engage with, preferring instead to buddy up with his mates the distillers. Geoff Munro said: 
_ RTDs - that is, alcopops - are consumed by the riskiest drinkers and pose an immediate threat to the health and wellbeing of teenagers around Australia _ Some single cans contain almost three standard drinks, which means young people get drunk quickly. Thousands of teenagers are admitted to hospital after overdosing on alcohol each year. Some suffer permanent brain damage, and some die, yet the industry is increasing the strength of drinks favoured by the youngest binge drinkers.These people understand the human cost of alcohol abuse, but unfortunately the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to take any sort of moral stand on this issue. I remind people that the Leader of the Opposition explicitly said that nothing could be done about binge drinking and it was pointless to even try. At the National Press Club last year he said, 'One should never underestimate the enterprising ingenuity of the Australian drinker.' Why not just give them a pat on the back and encourage them to drink even more, Leader of the Opposition! He has failed the test of moral leadership on this issue. He had a choice whether to lead public health experts, the police -  - I understand why the former health minister takes objection to this: he too has been in denial about whether binge drinking exists. He is on the record as saying that this is an overstated problem. The Leader of the Opposition had a choice to make. He had a choice to make about whether he would follow the lead of parents, whether he would follow the lead of the police and whether he would follow the lead of the AMA -  - The Leader of the Opposition had a clear choice to make. He had a choice about whether he wanted to be on the side of the health experts, the AMA, the police and the parents and join with us in tackling this issue. Instead, who did he decide to join? The distillers. This man has no moral compass on this issue and stands for nothing.</DOC>

 - It really does strike me as extraordinary that members opposite cannot understand the following basic things. Of course there are guidelines for all of the Building the Education Revolution program - for the programs for primary schools, for the programs for secondary schools and for the National School Pride program. Those guidelines are the same across the country. The member for Petrie mentioned yesterday to me how she had resolved a problem at a local school, covered by the member for Dickson. I think you will find, Member for Sturt, if you ask many members on this side of the parliament, that they are out there talking to their local schools, helping with getting information out there and helping with getting applications in. In my own electorate I have had a meeting of the principals of every local school to talk through -  - the program. I attended a principals forum, for example, in the member for Oxley's electorate to talk through with principals the way the program works. Members on this side of the House: (1) believe in this program, the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history, (2) because we understand the economic stimulus effects, want this program to roll out quickly to support jobs across right across the country; and (3) understand that when you are engaged in the biggest school modernisation program this nation has ever seen and you want to roll it out quickly for the economic stimulus and job-supporting effects, people need the information and they need the assistance. Properly, the member for Petrie provided that in the electorate of the member for Dickson to assist a school with a local problem.I understand that a desperate opposition want to make a cheap political point about this, led as they are by an opportunist. But before they go down this track too far, I will draw their attention to that great journal of record the North-West News. The front page from the most recent addition is headed up 'Hill race for hall'. I will quote Mr Knox, whom I understand is the LNP candidate in the local area. Mr Knox said:We are working hard to try and resolve it for them, they have been working on this project since 2004 and it is ready to go. - Given the questions of so-called political interference that have been raised by the opposition, I think the words of the LNP candidate in the Queensland election are probably very relevant. Mr Knox goes on to say:If I were Mr Rudd I would be keen to support a project that is ready to go.Who is ready to support a project that is ready to go? Mr Knox is, the member for Petrie is and this side of the House is. The member for Dickson is not because he does not want this school to get assistance, and every member over there is opposed to investing in their schools in the biggest school modernisation program this country has ever seen. How amazing!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for his question. The devastating effects of alcohol abuse are insidious and they are far-reaching. They contribute to family breakdown and family violence and financial, psychological and legal problems, with untold costs to the community. The link between alcohol, crime and social harm to the community is becoming much clearer. The facts are, in a word, sobering. A 2007 report from the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research estimated that New South Wales Police spend at least $50 million a year responding to alcohol related crime. According to the bureau, the money spent by New South Wales Police would pay the annual salaries of around 1,000 full-time constables in New South Wales.Why is it that, in the face of all the evidence talked about today, the opposition still refuses to support the government in providing a disincentive for kids to get hooked on alcohol at an early age? The Minister for Health and Ageing has reminded us that these alcopops are deliberately targeted at teenage girls, who drink them like soft drinks because that is exactly what they taste like. Nearly a year ago, the New South Wales commissioner, Andrew Scipione, said this:Drinking habits have changed. What many young Australians are doing now is going out determined to get drunk, whatever the consequences.There's been a normalisation of binge drinking rather than an encouragement of sensible drinking and sadly it involves both men and women _ Enough is enough and it's time to change the culture.That is exactly what the government has been going - investing $872 million in prevention, including tackling alcohol abuse, and investing $53 million in our binge-drinking strategy announced last year, with more to come after the Preventative Health Taskforce reports next year.The police know the reality. The government knows the reality. What will it take for the opposition to see the true scale of this problem and back the government's measures instead of backing profits for the alcohol industry? The Leader of the Opposition has backed down to the big distillers and he has decided to let the police of Australia -  - pick up the pieces. It is not the Liberal Party on the front line on binge drinking; it is the police. The police want action on binge drinking.Faced with a tough choice, Malcolm Turnbull has backed the peak distillers -  - and left it to the police to clean up the mess. Police in Australia are already stretched, dealing with all of the problems of life as they are thrown out. The last thing we need is for Malcolm Turnbull to hospital pass police cheaper alcopops.</DOC>

The question that the member for New England raises is an important one. He is right that there is a need for national coordination.

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for this question about an issue that is important not just in her electorate but in every community right around the nation. What we know is that Australia is facing a growing epidemic of alcohol fuelled violence, and it is having a devastating impact. If we have a look at the statistics we see that the number of assaults has jumped from around 9,000 per year in 1995 to almost 16,000 in 2006. We can also see that the methods of these assaults are apparently becoming increasingly gruesome, with reports of a 25 per cent increase in the number of glassings in New South Wales between 2003 and 2008. The simple truth is that whilst young people are often portrayed as the most common perpetrators of this violence they are also the most common victims. Statistics tell us that both males and females between the ages of 15 and 24 have the highest rate for being the victims of assault.This government recently hosted the inaugural youTHINK event, where over 650 young Australians from right around the country came together at 10 locations, which were linked by satellite, to give us their views on violence within the community and what needs to be done to offer them greater protection. We heard from Australians firsthand that they want to feel safe and secure in their environments and in their local communities, but we also heard directly from them their concerns about the links between alcohol and violence.This government echoes those concerns. We also want to break this nexus. That is why we have announced a comprehensive binge-drinking strategy, which of course includes the alcopop measure that is currently before the parliament. We know that the teenagers who drink alcohol at risky levels have a stronger preference for alcopops compared to low-risk drinkers. We also know that 75 per cent of females aged between 14 and 19 who consume alcohol at risky levels usually drink alcopops and that 64 per cent of males in the same category consume RTDs from a can. This means that alcopops are indeed central to the campaign to address binge drinking and violence. This is having a negative impact not just upon the health of young people but on their safety and security, which is why we on this side of the House have declared that we must act on these community concerns; we must stop the violence out there in the community. So we are showing leadership on this issue by putting in place the measures that are needed to protect young Australians and offer them a safe future. By comparison, the opposition are sitting back, carping, being negative and standing in the way instead of getting in line and helping pass this important legislation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, who is opposed to expenditure on schools, for the question. I will answer his question very specifically, and he might learn something about a $14 billion school modernisation program he is opposed to. From the very outset, as soon as passage of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan was secured through the parliament against the trenchant opposition of the Liberal Party, which does not want expenditure on Australian schools -  - As soon as passage of the bill was secured we issued guidelines and commenced consultative activities around the nation to answer questions about this program. In fact, the very first of those was a stakeholders forum in this Parliament House addressed by the Prime Minister and me. At that very first stakeholders forum a person asked: if you have already secured funds from another source, can you use those funds to work with a grant from the Building the Education Revolution program? The Prime Minister and I - at the very first stakeholders forum ever held on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan - said yes. What we also said was: 'Of course, we would want to be satisfied that there was not a substitution effect, because the aim of this program is to get extra money to schools and to support jobs around the country. So we would want to be assured that there was no substitution effect, but that partnering, that top-up, can be done.'Since that very first stakeholders forum in this Parliament House I personally would have been asked this question several dozen times by representatives of independent schools and Catholic schools that have engaged in some fundraising: can we put our money with your money and make a bigger project? The answer has always been yes, yes, yes. Obviously the same question was raised in relation to the Eatons Hill State School community hall, and the member for Petrie provided the answer that I would have provided if I were there, that the Prime Minister would have provided if he were there and that every member of the Labor Party would have provided if they were there, which was: yes, that can be done.Is there some confusion about these things? Yes, when you are engaging in the biggest school modernisation program this nation has ever seen. Yes, some local schools get part of the information wrong or a bit of wrong information and they need someone to help them out with it. Do you know what that job of helping out is called? It is called being a member of parliament. There are two categories of members of parliament in this House. There is the Labor Party and the Independents doing their job competently and there are those fools opposite who are opposed to expenditure on their local schools. Remarkable!</DOC>

 - I thank my friend the member for Lowe for his question and for his ongoing support for small businesses in the shopping centres of Five Dock, Drummoyne, Strathfield, Homebush, Rhodes and, indeed, Burwood. I point out that I got my first ever job in Flemings food market on Burwood Road, Burwood. That job was stacking shelves. It did not pay a lot in those days - $20 a week - but it was a good start.The Rudd government's responses to the global financial crisis have been designed to benefit small businesses all around Australia. The Economic Security Strategy included $8.7 billion of financial support for families, for pensioners, for carers, for seniors and for veterans, and these payments, which were made in December, flowed right through the economy. For example, the value of retail trade grew by 3.8 per cent in December, and that was the strongest monthly growth since August 2000. It was described by the Australian National Retail Association as a 'massive leap'. In relation to those payments, Sara Hoenig, an economist with the Commonwealth Bank, said:If there were any doubts about the efficacy of government fiscal stimulus packages _ the December retail sales report is a clear rebuttal.Michael Blythe, the Commonwealth Bank's chief economist, said:Policy is working in Australia. Lower interest reates and the first-home owners grant have lifted housing activity, and the pick-up in retail sales suggests the Government's cash handouts have worked.In December the government also announced a 20 per cent discount on the pay-as-you-go instalment which was due by the beginning of March, and that too received a lot of support from the small business community and continues to do so. Peter Anderson from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: _ it will come at an important time in 2009 when cash flows are expected to be tight _ I turn now to the payments under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which have now begun to flow to households. Those payments will also support small businesses through the months ahead. On that, the Council of Small Business of Australia said that the plan will: _ provide benefit to many small businesses and to the communities in which they live and operate.The Chamber of Commerce and Industry Western Australia described it as 'a timely shot in the arm' for small business.Small businesses will also benefit from the government's 30 per cent investment allowance, and I can point out that that has been welcomed too by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Western Australia, the NSW Business Chamber, the Australian Industry Group, the Combined Small Business Alliance of Western Australia, Master Association Australia, the National Farmers' Federation and the Pharmacy Guild. I can also report that Russell Garvey of the business advisory firm BDO Kendalls has said: ... this is a free kick from the Government. It is a genuine bonus from a tax perspective _ 
So there is another glowing endorsement.I turn now to Bill Evans, Chief Economist at Westpac, commenting on the latest index of consumer sentiment. An article in the Australian reported:The big surprise came with the outlook for the economy over the next five years which surged by 15.2%.It went on to quote Mr Evans as saying:This could only be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence that current policies are providing a strong foundation in the longer term.That is just a few out of a much larger number of endorsements of what the government is doing by way of a fiscal stimulus package. That is a lot of support, but what did the Leader of the Opposition also say about the government's fiscal stimulus package? Let's look at the first stimulus package. He said on 14 October:It will provide a stimulus to the economy, that's for certain - and he said:_ this is also a very significant economic stimulus _Then, in this chamber, on 10 March just a few days ago he said:_ we voted for it. But we did not say it would be an effective economic stimulus.So there he was back in October saying, 'It will provide a stimulus to the economy; that's for certain,' and, 'This is a significant stimulus.' Then in this House on 10 March he denied that he ever said it, saying, 'We did not say it would be an effective economic stimulus.' The reason for that is the opposition leader is dancing to the tune that is being played by the member for Higgins. The opposition leader did originally support the fiscal stimulus package and he had to change his tune. The Leader of the Opposition is dancing to that tune. Opposition policy in this chamber and in the Senate is being determined not by the Leader of the Opposition but by the leader-in-waiting, the member for Higgins. - Let us have a look at the economic team that the Leader of the Opposition has assembled. He has the shadow finance minister, Senator Coonan. She was in a debate with me, ahead of the release of the most recent national accounts, on Sky Television. - I am responding to the question, because I was asked about support for the package. We are not getting any support from the coalition. The Leader of the Opposition just interjected a moment ago, saying the stimulus package is not significant enough. There he was, back in December, saying, 'It will provide a significant stimulus.' Now he says we have got to go further. Then we have the Dusty Springfields on the opposition side, a-wishin' and a-hopin' and a-thinkin' and a-prayin' that maybe the global recession will go away.Let us look at this powerful economic team assembled by the Leader of the Opposition. The shadow finance minister said this ahead of the national accounts that came out a little while ago on Sky TV:We'll know, we'll have a better indication on Wednesday when the national accounts come out as to just how the combination of the stimulus packages are working _The national accounts referred to are those for the last three months of last year. The second stimulus package is flowing now, so the shadow finance minister was mystically thinking that the effect of a stimulus package that is flowing now will show up in the national accounts for the last three months of last year! Such is the stupidity, the low level of economic knowledge and the incompetence of the opposition. It is being dictated to by the member for Higgins. It is a hopeless team. You are absolute, total cheapjack opportunists and you should just give it away. That is all you are - cheapjack opportunists and a completely incompetent rabble.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, which is a serious question. I can assure the member that we are working with state governments on the section of the biggest modernisation program schools have ever had in this country which involves state schools. We are working with state governments so that we can involve local providers throughout the states, throughout New South Wales and throughout the country. If there is a problem at his school in relation to that issue of engaging local people then I am more than happy to work with him to get that issue resolved.The message we are consistently giving to state governments and block grant authorities in the independent and Catholic school sectors is that, because this is a school program that is part of an economic stimulus package, we want it supporting jobs around the country. We obviously want to maximise the engagement of local tradespeople. On that very specific school example I am more than happy to work with the member to resolve it. I remember when positions were reversed, and the member was Minister for Education, that we spent a very happy day at Werribee Secondary College in my electorate. I would only be too pleased to return the favour.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and I congratulate her on looking after not just her electorate - as with the 'Dorothy Dickson' from the member for Dickson today - but other electorates as well. I was with the member for Petrie just on Friday. We were announcing the support that we are giving to rail crossings as part of the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan.We are continuing to roll out the community infrastructure program. Today we have announced some 146 ready-to-go local infrastructure projects in regional South Australia, worth $5 million. We have announced some 164 ready-to-go infrastructure projects in regional Western Australia. And I am pleased that we have jointly announced with the member for Lyne some $1.1 million for community infrastructure on the mid-North Coast. These projects are being rolled out across the country. Every single local government area, every single one, regardless of which way they vote, is receiving support through the community infrastructure program. - He has no idea. Money is already being rolled out for these programs. More than 300 council projects have already been approved. Over 129 contracts have already been signed with local government. But it is not inconsistent for this current opposition to have a local government spokesperson who opposes funding for local government, because we have local members who oppose funding for their local schools. Today we had an extraordinary spectacle. Can you imagine the tactics committee meeting this morning? There would have been about 20 of them sitting there, because everyone gets a guernsey. They are sitting there and the member for Dickson says: 'I've got a good idea. I've got the government. They're providing funds for Eatons Hill State School. It has 960 kids and they're going to support them getting a hall. They're going to support them getting upgrades. Let's really get into them. Let's have four questions on that.' - Any day soon they will have to move their tactics committee meeting to 1R1 because everybody is coming along; everyone gets a prize. That is why we see the questions from the backbenchers, because they are all focused on themselves. Today during question time -  - In this chamber there is an obstacle to the rollout of funding for primary schools; to the rollout of the community infrastructure program; to the rollout of support for railway crossings; to the rollout of support for road spending - to the rollout of these projects. There is an obstacle and those opposite indicate through their interjections who it is. Those opposite are obsessed with their own internal processes - that is why during question time today they conducted a number of ballots. Relax, Malcolm, I understand it was not about the leadership. They spent the whole of question time filling in ballots on the back bench and on the front bench. They were not concerned with issues of concern to Australians, because they are simply out of touch. They and their tactics committee are also out of their depth.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question. On the matter he raises, I have some interesting information for the House. I am advised that under the Howard government - a government comprised of Mr Howard, Mr Costello, Mr Turnbull and Mr Hockey - bonuses were paid to people in exactly the same situation as the subject of the questioning today. The low-income tax offset bonuses handed down by the Howard government were paid to people in exactly the same situation which those opposite are feigning such outrage over today. They supported these payments when they were in government and, now they are in opposition, they have undergone a 180-degree backflip because they are governed by political opportunism.I am advised that the tax bonus is available to anyone who is an Australian resident for tax purposes in the 2007-08 income tax year and who meets the other eligibility requirements. I am further advised that the series of personal income tax measures under the Howard government in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07 flowed through to the vast majority of incarcerated individuals who paid tax in the relevant financial year. I am advised that there is only one tax treatment that excludes incarcerated individuals and that is the senior Australian tax offset. The ATO has advised that it could not exclude persons in this category who had paid tax in the 2007-08 financial year with the information currently available.In framing his first question in question time today, I think it would have been important for the Leader of the Opposition to simply do this: reflect on what you did in government and apply the same principle to yourself.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In response to the global recession, the Australian government has engaged in actions on the domestic front and actions internationally because we are dealing with a global economic storm. The G20 agenda, which will come to a head with the G20 summit in London in a week or two, has a number of core elements to it: the first is to restore private credit flows to the global economy; the second is to reform the global financial system in order to reduce the likelihood that we will have a repeat of this global economic crisis that we are experiencing at present; and the third is to coordinate the delivery of fiscal stimulus in order to bring support to the global economy at a time when the private economy is contracting because of the contraction of private credit flows.Progress was made on these matters at the G20 finance ministers meeting, which the Treasurer attended on Australia's behalf last weekend. But further progress must be made when the G20 summit is held in London in a week or two in early April. The G20 finance ministers meeting dealt with one core element of this agenda - that is, a framework for the removal of toxic assets from the bank balance sheets of the globally significant banks. A framework was put forward by the finance ministers at their meeting to which Australia contributed. However, further work must be done to ensure that national governments, which have responsibility for globally significant banks, take action consistent with those principles in order to bring about a restoration of private credit flows. That is necessary in order to restimulate the global economy, to restimulate employment and to restimulate jobs, including here in Australia.A second area of necessary reform goes to the future of the International Monetary Fund, and this also is a core part of the G20 agenda. There is a long, long way to go yet before we can achieve effective reform of the IMF. Nonetheless, we must take consistent, considered and coordinated action across governments to boost the resources available to the International Monetary Fund and to reform its governance. This is necessary because of the unfolding economic crisis in emerging economies across the world as well. We are concerned about the impact of the global economic slowdown on emerging economies not only because of what happens with poverty there but also because of the reverberation of that on the entire global economy and on jobs in this country as well. A further area of reform for the G20 goes to the regulation of the financial sector for the world for the future and much work remains to be done there, including the proper regulation of hedge funds and proper progress on the work on executive remuneration within financial services companies operating around the world.At home, we have been active on three principal fronts as part of our economic stimulus strategy for Australia, firstly in ensuring the continued stability of the Australian financial system, bearing in mind that this global recession has already seen more than 30 overseas banks collapse or have to be bailed out by their local governments in order to keep going. By contrast, in this country we continue to have a strong banking system and we continue to have a guarantee, for the first time in Australia's history, delivered to Australian deposit holders, those opposite having sat on their hands for 12 years and not provided any such parallel protection. Secondly, we have an economic stimulus, short term and long term, in order to support jobs and to build the infrastructure Australia needs for the future, including the biggest school modernisation program in Australia's history. Thirdly, we have taken action to support those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. Our responsibility as a government and that of the entire community is to support those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The government has announced some measures in this respect. There is further work to be done.Underpinning the government's economic stimulus strategy also is our clear-cut statement that it requires the government to go into temporary deficit funded by temporary borrowing. That is the simple truth. It is the simple truth which every government around the world in the developed economy has had to confront and respond to. Furthermore, our policy is equally clear-cut in that, when the global economy recovers and we return to trend growth in Australia, this government's policy is that we will then take action to return the budget to surplus and, under those circumstances, use those funds to pay down temporary borrowings. That is the responsible course of action for any government around the world at present confronted with an unprecedented, at least since the Depression, global economic crisis.Part of the government's strategy in dealing with the challenges to Australian financial markets is of course what we do to support those financial markets now, given the challenges that have occurred with the withdrawal of foreign credit from some of those providers of financial credit lines in Australia. That goes to the heart of the government's proposal for a business investment partnership between this government and the major banks in Australia. The reason for that is as follows. We have the real risk of a withdrawal of private credit, through foreign banks' indication, from Australia. We have a sector involved, in the case of the commercial property sector, which employs some 150,000 Australians. You have two possible responses to this: sit on your hands and do nothing, or act on a temporary basis to support the commercial property sector and the 150,000 jobs dependent on the continued health and vitality of that sector.I would draw the attention of those opposite to a statement issued on 17 March by the Property Council of Australia, which says:It is a blow to our industry and the broader economy that ABIP has not received the Coalition's backing.The statement goes on to say:It's a fact that foreign banks are winding back their exposure to the Australian property market, repatriating capital at the bequest of their new owners - foreign governments - and also - We need this contingency measure - namely, the investment partnership - even more now than we did two months ago.I would suggest those opposite look at the statements from the Property Council and at those from the Master Builders Association of Australia, which says in its statement of 13 March that it calls upon the opposition to provide:_bipartisan support for the early passing of the Australian Business Investment Partnership Limited Bill (ABIP).The Master Builders Association also says that the government has acted in a timely way. We have to focus on what is the immediate problem here, which is a lack of finance flows in this industry, and without those finances, so says the Master Builders Association, we will see job losses. That is what the MBA says about the activities of those opposite.The Australian government is taking decisive action to deal with what is occurring in private financial markets to provide stimulus through the budget by way of our infrastructure bill and also through the programs that we are advancing to support those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. That is the government's plan - a clear-cut economic stimulus plan for the future. I contrast it with those opposite, whose strategy is this: to sit back, to wait, to do nothing and to hope that the global economic recession gets worse and that more people lose their jobs so that they can take political advantage from it. The contrast is absolutely clear-cut.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for his question, because unlike the opposition the Rudd government is not willing to sit and wait for foreign lenders to withdraw their money. The opposition think that is fine. The Treasury has been unable to get a commitment from foreign banks operating in this country that none are withdrawing. They have been unable to give that commitment to the Treasury and, as a consequence of that, for the reasons outlined by the Prime Minister before, the country faces the real prospect that some foreign banks will withdraw from banking syndicates in this country. The consequences of that for property prices and jobs in the commercial property sector are grave. Some 150,000 people work in those sectors.Those opposite over there cannot contain their glee. Look at the smiles on their faces - they cannot contain their glee at the discomfort the global recession is causing this country and they cannot contain their glee at the fact that foreign banks may well withdraw, threatening employment in the property sector. That is why the government has put forward what is a very responsible measure. It is not an open-ended commitment; it is a very prudent commitment. It is a commitment that has been made after seeking the best advice. It is a commitment to support commercially viable projects after independent assessment. Failure to act here will cost tens of thousands of jobs in the Australian economy - of that there is little doubt.But of course those opposite have come into this House and repeatedly voted for higher unemployment. They came in here when the Nation Building and Jobs Plan was put through and voted against jobs. They voted for higher unemployment. And they will not accept the advice of those in the community, including the business community, that recommend that this measure is absolutely essential to confidence and employment. To quote again from the Property Council:ABIP is an essential mechanism to inject stability and confidence into commercial property lending.And the list goes on - with the Master Builders Association and so on. This government will not sit idly by and watch those jobs and small- and medium-sized businesses get wiped out by fluctuations in the global credit market. This is too important for the politicking and point-scoring that is coming from those on the other side of the House.Of course in opposing this vital measure they are opposing jobs in the Australian economy, and they are doing this in the face of the worst global recession in living memory - because their approach is very simple: just let the market rip. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said when he was asked about this: leave it up to the market. We know what the market will do and we also know that the latest assessment from the IMF is that growth contracted on an annualised basis in the December quarter in the developed world by seven per cent. And those opposite say, 'Let the market rip.' That is a recipe for higher unemployment.As the Prime Minister indicated before, what they are on about here is simply point-scoring. They do not care whether thousands of Australians' jobs go to the wall; they want to celebrate a political dividend that may come from that consequence. You can see it in their glee and hear it in the moronic statements from those opposite. This issue is simply too serious for the point-scoring from those opposite. What the Leader of the Opposition has demonstrated here is that he is just an opportunist. He would rather see the commercial property sector hit the wall than see the Rudd government succeed. It is that simple, and that is why their attitude should be condemned. We will pursue this matter as far as we possibly can but unfortunately it appears that in the Senate we will not have the support of the minor parties. The jobs of all those Australians in the commercial property sector threatened by their decision will be on their heads, and shame on them.</DOC>

 - I would remind the House that the global leadership provided by the Howard government was to preside over the biggest corruption scandal in Australia's history - it was called the wheat for weapons scandal. There they all sat in the cabinet while it all happened and pretended that they had nothing to do with it. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I thank the member for Sturt in particular for his interjection. The wheat for weapons corruption scandal did not happen in ancient Mesopotamia. It happened in modern Iraq and it only happened a few years ago. But, then again, not one for details is the member for Sturt, as reflected in his engagement yesterday with the Deputy Prime Minister on that minor matter of schools. But we will just let that rest.I am surprised indeed by the member for Casey's question, given his role as the deputy numbers man for the member for Higgins. To launch a vicarious attack through me on the member for Higgins, the former Treasurer, for having administered selfsame payment to the same category of individuals, I find remarkable indeed. My response to the honourable member's question is: reflect carefully on the arrangements which pertained to and were implemented under the previous government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question and know that she is very concerned to ensure that working people in her electorate have fairness at work and that the employers in her electorate have all the flexibility they need to get on with their businesses. In the lead-up to the 2007 election the Labor Party published its workplace relations policies, and in the election it received a clear mandate from the Australian people for those policies. I remind the House that our election policy clearly stated:A Rudd Labor Government will introduce a simple system for determining who can bring an unfair dismissal claim based on three circumstances:an employee who is employed by an employer who employs 15 or more employees must have been employed for 6 months;an employee who is employed by an employer who employs fewer than 15 employees must have been employed for 12 months _That is on page 19 of Forward with Fairness, our policy implementation plan published in August 2007. The fact that this policy was well known to the Australian community and was campaigned on by the Labor Party was acknowledged by none other than the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition on 13 December last year said - this was recorded in the Australian newspaper and not denied by the Leader of the Opposition - in his words, not mine:_ Labor took a proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to the election and won. So we must respect that.In the Fair Work Bill debate that is unfolding in the Senate, we ask of the Liberal Party no more and no less than this: to back the words of their leader - apparently a test too hard for them. We are asking them for no more and no less than this: to back the words of their leader. Of course, their leader has also said Work Choices is dead, but now we see in the Senate the Liberal Party doing everything they can to maintain the Work Choices rip-offs.Yesterday in question time I unveiled a new rip-off from the Liberal Party. When in government they ripped redundancy entitlements off working people and in opposition they wanted to do the same trick. They wanted to rip redundancy entitlements off working people. The Liberal Party had put forward an amendment which would have changed the definition of 'small business' for the purpose of redundancy arrangements and would have ripped redundancy entitlements off working Australians. When I presented this to the House - Leave not granted. - I will explain this matter very clearly to the House. The amendment circulated by the Liberal Party sought to change the definition of small business in the Fair Work Bill. It supported changing the number from 15 to 25 and it purported to introduce that the number needs to be an effective full-time equivalent. - Then, and I will acknowledge this - I presume this is what the shadow minister is yelling about - for the purpose of redundancy it did acknowledge in the amendment that, even though it had changed the definition for unfair dismissal, for redundancy the number should be 15 but the definition of an effective full-time equivalent should be kept. That would have, if it had become the law of this country, changed small business redundancy entitlements so instead of being fewer than 15 on a head count it would have been fewer than 15 effective full-time equivalent employees - quite a different test - and it would have ripped redundancy entitlements off working Australians. - The shadow minister, who is yelling now, came to the dispatch box after question time and said - and I am going to quote him; I will be fair to him: _ that I and other members of the opposition were seeking to change the definition of a small business for the purposes of paying redundancy. That is completely and utterly false _That is what he said at the end of question time after I exposed the Liberal Party redundancy revolt. Then he issued a press release that says, 'Gillard misleads again', claiming I had wilfully misled the House. Then at 10.16 pm last night, the Liberal Party -  - Then at 10.16 pm last night, the Liberal Party went into the Senate with a different set of amendments -  - I repeat, at 10.16 pm last night, the Liberal Party went into the Senate with the very flaw that I brought to the House's attention in question time corrected. There are two explanations for this course of conduct: (1) is that the shadow minister is completely incompetent - plausible; and (2) is that - and I think this is probably the correct one - the Liberal Party was involved in a deliberate plan to rip off redundancy entitlements from Australian workers and got caught.This goes to prove that when it comes to workplace relations do not listen to what they say, watch what they do. The Leader of the Opposition is out there saying, 'Work Choices is dead', and then in the party room he is saying, 'Let's go in and fight to keep Work Choices alive'. The Leader of the Opposition is out there saying that they will respect Labor's mandate on unfair dismissal, but the Liberal Party in this place are threatening to keep Work Choices alive on the basis of issues around unfair dismissal. The Liberal Party engaged in a redundancy rip-off. They denied it and then tried to fix it in the dead of night.I say to the Australian people: always watch what they do, not what they say. And I say to senators as the rest of this debate unfolds -  - In conclusion, as the rest of this debate unfolds in the Senate, I say to every senator involved that every Liberal amendment has within it a rip-off they will not tell you about. The Liberal Party did it yesterday and we caught them. Every other amendment has a rip-off at its heart and that is why each and every one of them will be rejected by the government, because we are delivering on our promise to get rid of Work Choices, whilst the Liberal Party twist and turn and do everything they can to keep the rip-offs that they loved so much in government.</DOC>

 - That question -  - That question from the shadow Treasurer just demonstrates why those opposite cannot be taken seriously in the national debate. We are dealing with a global financial crisis which has turned into a global recession. It is posing the biggest economic challenge to this country in generations. They have got the hide to get up and pretend that the essential economic stimulus we have put in place to boost demand at precisely the time our economy is threatened is not necessary. They are pretending that there is no need for a concerted government response in the face of the biggest global recession since the Depression - no need at all! - no need for any economic stimulus, no need for the payments to pensioners, no need for the payments to families with children, no need for the payments to carers and no need for tax bonuses.That is what this question is all about. It is somehow to justify their pathetic political strategy in this House, when the truth is that the country desperately needs these payments to boost demand, to fill the gap before the spending is put in place, which is part of our investment package to boost demand through boosting expenditure on schools, housing and energy efficiency. They do not support those either. So what does the government do when there is such a large external shock? How does the government respond to prevent unemployment going through the roof?I will tell you what a government does: it takes decisive action, and that is what this government has done. We have taken decisive action which has involved payments to pensioners. It has involved payments to families. It involves tax bonuses to many people who have not received a tax cut from those opposite. That is certainly what it involves. I guess what the member for North Sydney is saying is that they now oppose the $900 bonus that goes to single low-income earners - people they could never give a tax cut to. They now oppose the tax bonus which is going to those families without children - people who rarely got a tax cut from those opposite. That is what these questions are all about - to justify somehow their political strategy, which wants the country to simply sit and wait and have the global recession run over it, causing immense human carnage. I say to them: you should be deeply embarrassed by your approach in the House today. It is certainly not supported by any of the leading business organisations in this country; they absolutely understand the need for economic stimulus. - Those opposite are so politically twisted that they would rather see the country fail than the government succeed. That is the truth that underlines the tactics in this House today and yesterday.I went to the G20 conference and, as a consequence of that, I was not here last Thursday or on Monday. I tell you what: when I came back to the House yesterday I was shocked by the approach of those opposite. They have become politically embittered and this is preventing the debate the country needs at this stage, when we face such an enormous challenge. - They are united by their hatred of the Labor Party. They should be acting with us because of love of the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. It is a very important question and one that many Australians are deeply concerned about. Today the government announced two new initiatives on the issue of executive pay. All honourable members in this House will be aware of the deep community concern and anger over this issue, particularly when some of these payments are received by people who are giving redundancies to large numbers of working Australians.The Rudd government is determined to do all that can be done to get business leaders to heed the community's message on this issue. We are certainly very determined to do that. Today I announced two important down payments in this area. The first one will curb golden handshakes in the form of termination payments paid to executives in Australia. Laws left to this government by those opposite allow termination payments for directors to reach up to seven times their annual pay before any approval process is required. The community is deeply offended by some of these golden parachutes, so the government will amend the Corporations Act to significantly lower that threshold, and this means termination payments will require shareholder approval if they exceed one year's average base salary for directors.Secondly, we will also legislate to extend the coverage as to which termination payments are to be subjected to shareholder approval. Currently only directors' termination payments must be approved. We will legislate to expand the coverage of shareholder approval to cover executives named in the executive pay report - in most cases, the five highest paid executives. We will also broaden the definition of 'termination benefit' to catch all types of payment and rewards given at termination. Finally, we have asked the Productivity Commission to examine the broader issue of executive pay. Today the government announced that we have appointed Professor Allan Fels as an associate commissioner to assist the Chair of the Productivity Commission, Gary Banks, with this process.Golden handshakes, particularly where a company has not performed or where workers are being retrenched, are simply a means of rewarding failure and are absolutely unacceptable. So today we are sending a very clear message to corporate Australia: your actions are under scrutiny and the community does expect better because, as we go through this challenge of the global recession, we are going to require all the reserves of unity that we can muster as a nation. We need executives and workers working together, but to get that trust there has to be basic fairness and decency in the arrangements that apply to the workforce as well as to those who employ them.So it is the case that we must do better here. We must do a lot better. It is not just a question of the individuals involved; it is a question of the community having trust in all of its vital institutions, including its successful business enterprises, and that is why reform is required in this area - because, frankly, the largesse of the last decade has been a slap in the face to many working people who, in a system of enterprise bargaining, understand that they do need to increase productivity to get a wage rise. That has been central to the mantra on this side of politics for many years, but workers want to know why the same principles do not necessarily apply to the people who employ them. That is why this is such an important measure. It requires reform. It requires better corporate governance. It does require incentives in the system which reflect the capacity for work and the contribution that people make.Of course, in the last decade or so, for many people the gap has just widened and it has got out of whack. It is a complex issue, and that is why we have decided to have a Productivity Commission inquiry and look at all of the issues involved. Further measures will come following that inquiry. It is very serious, but it also goes to the heart of unity in this country and how we can work together to make our economy stronger and not be divided because of these obscene payments that are being taken by a few.</DOC>

 - From someone who presided over HIH I do not think that we ought to be lectured about probity - not by a lawyer for merchant bankers and not by a merchant banker. They have no credibility to lecture this side of the House. There we have it: the former merchant banker, the lawyer for merchant bankers and the member for Higgins up the back, who could not get a job as a merchant banker. He is going up the totem pole every day. - Those opposite seek to say that there are no safeguards in this legislation. They seek to deny the fact that its governance rules mean that it has to operate commercially. They seek to ignore all of that. We set up a corporate structure here with the best advice from some of the most respected people in Australian business -  -  - people who I know are respected by the Leader of the Opposition. This just shows how opportunistic he is prepared to be, because we have taken advice from people who, I would say, are not on our side of politics when this was set up. We have taken plenty of advice, and we have put in place all the safeguards for this enterprise that you would expect with modern corporate governance. They were outlined at length in the House last night, and in the summing up of the debate I went through them in great detail, because this is only here for viable commercial property holders.What the opposition are seeking to deny is the fact that foreign banks, if they withdraw, cannot be replaced by domestic funding. They must be the only people in the country who do not believe that. First of all, they obviously do not accept that there is a problem internationally with toxic assets in the banking system. They do not accept the fact that international banks that have been nationalised in their home country, whether it is Britain, France or Germany, are now being told to come home by their new owners. They do not appreciate any of these facts; they just seek to ignore them all because of their blind politics when it comes to trying to score a point against the Australian Labor Party.Of course, the member for North Sydney seeks to say that the Vision tower in Brisbane would automatically receive funding. It will go through that process like every other project, and I have no idea whether it will receive funding, but I tell you one thing: we will try. We will give them access to a financial instrument if they pass the test. Do you know what that means? Australian jobs. That would be a terrible thing - supporting Australian employment! Your political approach in this matter has unravelled in this House today. Your naked political opportunism and your bitterness have been on show for all of the Australian people, and you should be ashamed of yourselves.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. I know that as the mother of several young children she is thinking about what will happen when they become teenagers. Along with many on this side of the House, she is particularly interested to make sure that teenagers do not have cheap and easy access to alcopops.Today in the Senate the Liberal Party have made clear again their intention to oppose the government's alcopops measure. What they have made clear is that they intend to send a cheque for $300 million directly back to the distillers. That is what I call one hell of a shout. They are going to make alcopops cheaper for teenagers. As a consequence of the Leader of the Opposition's absolute lack of interest in this issue and his determination to show no leadership, he is going to make sure that young people can get these products at a cheaper price everyday in probably just a couple of weeks time if this measure fails. In fact, I am sure that Malcolm Turnbull is going to fast become the toast of every 18th birthday party from Brisbane to Broome. They will be happy that they can get these products cheaper thanks to the Leader of the Opposition. It really is quite surprising.He might be the toast of the 18th birthday parties across the country, but he will not be toasted at the emergency departments across the country. The Liberal Party will be cursed when emergency departments have to pick up the pieces across the country. He might be toasted at schoolies, but he certainly will be cursed at every police station across the country. He might be toasted around the board tables of big alcopop companies, but around the kitchen tables, by mums and dads of teenagers, he will be cursed.Let me explain again why this measure is so important - particularly for those on the other side of the House who might not have been in the parliament in 2000 when the Liberal Party first created this tax break for alcolpops. They took a sugary drink they knew was targeted at under-age drinkers and they gave it a tax break. Since then, these drinks have become immensely popular. Let us just have a look at one of the statistics. For high-risk female drinkers aged 15 to 17, in the year 2000, before the Liberal Party gave alcopops this tax break, only 21 per cent had drunk alcopops on their last drinking occasion. By 2004, after four years of this tax break, that had risen to three out of every four 15- to 17-year-old high-risk female drinkers. Alcopops sales shot up by 250 per cent, all courtesy of a decision by the member for Higgins.We know that alcohol abuse is a serious problem. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, we are prepared to do something about it. It is not just the alcopops measure; we are also investing $872 million in prevention measures - $53 million in direct anti-binge-drinking initiatives. If this measure is passed we have put on the table another $50 million to look at sponsorship, to look at expanding the social marketing campaigns and to look at a number of community-level initiatives. Since our measure has been in place - for almost 12 months - 310 million fewer standard alcopops drinks have been sold. That is a lot less consumption. Overall, alcohol sales have fallen by 124 million standard drinks - and Malcolm Turnbull wants to give them all back.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his entirely relevant question. Binge drinking, the excessive consumption of alcohol, is a national problem that confronts police in every jurisdiction across Australia every day. A report prepared by the National Drug Law Enforcement Research Fund, published last year, conservatively estimated the cost of alcohol related crime in Australia to be over $1.7 billion a year based on recent analysis. The policing costs alone are estimated at $747 million a year. Imagine what we could do if we had an extra $747 million a year to spend on front-line policing. There would be another 7,000 constables.The men and women of our police forces routinely face situations as a consequence of alcohol abuse that all of us here would find utterly confronting. They are often the first on the scene attending horrific road accidents. Then they have the onerous responsibility of telling the parents that their child, a young P-plate driver, was killed because of an alcohol related incident. They have the responsibility for presenting these tragic cases to the coroner and prosecuting another P-plater for causing the death of their best friend. The report that I have mentioned also found that the total cost of alcohol related road crashes was over $3 billion a year, including human costs of nearly $2 billion and general costs, including police attendance, of nearly half a billion dollars - again, money that could be far better spent.We in the Commonwealth have a responsibility to do what we can to demonstrate leadership, and that means right here in the parliament. Over the break we are going to be spending more time working in our electorates. I cannot imagine how members opposite will explain to their local police - the men and women on the front line facing these issues on a daily basis - why they do not support them. While it is the states and territories that deal with the day-to-day law enforcement difficulties that come from binge drinking, the Commonwealth must act where it has the power to do so. The government finds it astonishing that the opposition are refusing to support Australia's working police men and women and prefer to hand truckloads of money back to the liquor industry. Police have been publicly pleading for more action on binge drinking. We should not ignore our police. It is they who are on the front line, not the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for agriculture for his question. He refers to the abolition of the 40 per cent export subsidy which was proposed in the budget papers of the previous government. The previous government had it expiring at the end of the current financial year, and it does expire at the end of the current financial year. We had ABARE model what the cost would actually be to exporters, and the ABARE modelling came back that the costs to exporters would be equivalent to a half of one cent movement in the Australian dollar.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. Once again, of course, it is a Labor member who takes a keen interest in the welfare of schools in the electorate of Dickson. The Labor Party yet again steps into the breach to make sure that those schools are properly represented in this place.I know that the state of the application for funding of the Eatons Hill State School is a matter of extreme interest to this House - after all, we had three questions, three points of order and a member of parliament excluded over it yesterday - so I wanted to make sure that members around the parliament understood that this school, and schools right around the country, are eligible for funding under the Rudd Labor government's Building the Education Revolution program. It is the single biggest school modernisation program in this nation's history, covering 9,540 schools around the country, with a total funding injection of $14.7 billion to renew and rebuild our schools and to support jobs right around the country in these difficult days following the global financial crisis.This program has been embraced by members of parliament who want to represent their electorates and by the Independent members of parliament who want to see improvements in their local schools. It has been embraced by education stakeholders, and I will quote just one. The President of the Australian Primary Principals Association, Leonie Trimper, described it as fantastic news:This is a fantastic win-win for all Australians _ a lasting investment in Australia's future  -  our primary school students.That is her endorsement of this program. Despite the fact that education stakeholders have endorsed it, that schools around the country have endorsed it and that decent, hardworking members of parliament in this place have endorsed it, we know that the Liberal Party and the member for Dickson are opposed to it. Apparently, their only interest in this program, as evidenced in this parliament, is making sure they get invited to the opening ceremony. They did not want to come into the parliament and vote for the program and they do not want to assist their local schools getting into the program. And, when a local school is assisted by someone else, then they want to criticise the provision of that assistance - the way the member for Dickson criticised the member for Petrie for helping out one of his local schools in this parliament yesterday.Just to complete the picture, I say to the member for Dickson that, in standing in the way of the Building the Education Revolution program, he is not just standing in the way of new facilities at the Eatons Hill State School. For the edification of the member, let us be absolutely clear about what he is standing in the way of. He is standing in the way of new facilities at the 39 primary and K-12 schools in his electorate, who, in total, are eligible for $69.5 million of funding under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program - and I table a list of those schools. He is standing in the way of 45 schools in his electorate who are eligible for up to $6.2 million in National School Pride Program funding - and I table a list of those schools. He is standing in the way of the fact that the eight secondary schools in his electorate are eligible to apply for either a science laboratory or a language centre - and I table a list of those eight schools that he has opposed these new facilities for and opposed giving any assistance to.Just in case the member for Dickson is never able to return to the Eatons Hill State School - and I am betting there is some merit in me coming to that conclusion - and in case he never sees this facility, I table, for his edification and for the edification of the House, the foundation plan of the new facility the Eatons Hill State School has planned, the front elevation view of the new facility the Eatons Hill State School has planned and the site plan of the new facility the Eatons Hill State School has planned. And, just because I know that the 960-odd students at that school and their parents got such a shock yesterday that their local member of parliament would stand against funding for their school in this parliament, I will also table the diagrammatic electrical plan of the new facility for the Eatons Hill State School.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for that question. I know that these issues are of concern to the members of Northern Queensland electorates. In previous times, I have been to Townsville and Cairns, where, because of the growing population, there is enormous pressure on the hospitals. However, I might remind the member that the previous government, which he was part of, did not have any facility for infrastructure investment that they would provide to the states and territories to work on these issues.We have established a health and hospitals infrastructure fund, and we have invited states and territories to put in requests for priority projects. I know that Townsville Hospital is an issue for which the state Labor government - obviously there is an election on - has previously expressed interest in receiving support for. We are going through a process where an independent advisory board makes recommendations to us, and we will assess those and make announcements in due course. I might also remind the member for Herbert that we made a number of election commitments in Townsville, including the establishment of a new GP superclinic. The consultations in Townsville were very well attended. One of the key issues raised was that the establishment of a clinic, appropriately supported, would take pressure off the emergency department of Townsville Hospital. He might also be aware that we committed $750 million to invest in emergency departments across the country. Queensland received $146 million of that funding. Those emergency departments that are under particular pressure in growing communities like Townsville will be receiving that funding. Of course, it might be a matter for a new government, if they still wish to receive our funding. I know that my colleague the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has been told by the Liberal National Party that some of that money would not be wanted. I hope that is not the case in health.The member might also be aware that we provided funding for additional elective surgery procedures - something that, in Far North Queensland, has been an issue. Queensland committed, for the $27.6 million that we provided them with, to undertake 4,000 extra surgeries. In fact, they were able to carry out 5,928 surgeries, and I know that across Queensland people are very grateful that the Commonwealth government has been prepared to work with the state government to deliver those services. We intend to keep doing that in the provision of investment in our hospitals, in the provision of investment in primary infrastructure and in making sure that our infrastructure fund is used in an appropriate way.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Blair for his question and note the significant impact that the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan will have on his electorate. As part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, the government provided Defence Housing Australia with $251.6 million for the building of 802 dwellings for Australian Defence Force personnel in metropolitan and regional areas across the country. The member for Blair's electorate will benefit from the construction of 133 new dwellings as a result of this program.I am pleased to announce that strong progress has been made since February of this year, when the plan was first launched. Seven building contracts have been signed, worth $24.5 million, to build 100 houses. These are in Brisbane, at Pickering Hill; in Adelaide, at Andrews Farm; and in Ipswich, at Fairview Rise. Construction of these dwellings will commence in a few weeks. By June of this year, we expect to sign another 32 contracts for a further 283 houses. Under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, construction will be carried out in 17 areas across Australia - in Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Melbourne, Townsville, Ipswich, Sydney and many other places. It is estimated that the building program will support up to 2,000 jobs.I can also flag today that DHA will soon establish an apprenticeships program to support DHA's expanding building program, bringing forward their pre-existing building schedule by some 74 per cent. The new apprenticeships program will deliver 20 new four-year apprenticeships to provide employment and training opportunities in locations where DHA will have intensive building activity over the next few years. Nicole Quinn, the National Convenor of Defence Families Australia, said about this program:DHA is very excited to see such an extensive rollout of new housing for ADF members and their families. It is great to see the government recognising the support ADF families provide to our serving members. This extra housing is a welcome step to accommodate Defence families with modern housing in recognition of the transient lives they lead.That is a very strong endorsement of this program. It is a program that is very popular with the defence community across Australia. It is a program which will create job opportunities and opportunities for small business across the community. I find it passing strange, then, that the following members of this House, whose electorates will actually benefit from this construction activity -  - The member for Paterson, the member for Herbert - he who says that he is a great supporter of Defence Force families; he who says he is a supporter of the Defence Force in Australia. Why did he oppose a proposition that would provide an additional 118 houses in his electorate? Why did he oppose a proposition that would provide jobs for workers in his electorate? Why did he oppose a proposition that would provide opportunities for small business in his electorate?Of course, there are others. Let me tell you who they are: the member for Gilmore; the member for Groom; the student, the member for Mayo; the member for Indi; the member for Riverina; and the member for Flinders. What is even stranger is that there are 17 opposition electorates that have significant Defence Force facilities within them. What do these members of the opposition say to their Defence Force communities when they visit these places? - They are consistent all right. When they are asked, 'Did you support this proposal? Do you support our families in getting new homes?' they have to say 'no'. In fact, what they have to tell them is: 'We would vote to not give you a brass razoo. You're not worth a crumpet. We couldn't be bothered giving you anything, not even the crumbs off the table, to provide new housing.'The member for Wentworth has some significant Defence Force assets in his community. He has the Garden Island dockyard and defence precinct, he has HMAS Kuttabul, he has HMAS Watson, he has the Navy fleet headquarters and he has Navy Fleet Base East. - And Victoria Barracks is in it as well. Let me ask the member for Wentworth: why wouldn't you bother saying to those people why you voted against this particular measure? - I say to the member for Wentworth: what are you going to say to the members of the Defence Force in those barracks as to why you oppose this measure? Will you tell them that you voted against giving them any money for new housing through this proposal? What we know is that those opposite exhibit gross hypocrisy about jobs. What we hear out of the opposition leader's mouth time and time again is 'jobs, jobs, jobs'. But when he gets the opportunity -  -  - When he gets the opportunity to vote for jobs, jobs, jobs, what does he do? He votes against it. What does he do when he gets an opportunity to vote -  - As others have said in this place, we will know the truth of their words by their actions. We know what their actions in this place are on jobs, jobs, jobs. They vote against them at every opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I just heard the member for North Sydney interject, 'It should still be privately owned.' I would refer the member for North Sydney, who had something to do with the Greiner-Fahey government, to the report of the New South Wales Auditor-General, who reported into the privatisation of that hospital and remarked that, 'The government of the time was paying for the hospital twice then giving it away.' - The member for North Sydney says the Auditor-General of New South Wales is completely wrong and that he, the member for North Sydney - the then adviser, I presume, to the then Premier of New South Wales - was right. I will let others account for the history of that.The honourable member raises an important question about the state of the hospital at Port Macquarie. He asked specifically about an update on the progress of his submission to the Health and Hospitals Fund. I cannot give that to him. I will inquire after question time from the Minister for Health and Ageing as to the status of his submission. More broadly, could I say in response to the honourable member that the purpose of the Health and Hospitals Fund is to provide support for further injections into the public health system of Australia. I would note also for the record, in response to the honourable member's question, that the fund is directly opposed by those opposite. Their position on investment at the national government level into the health and hospitals of Australia is that they refuse to take any role in sharing the burden. That is reflected in their vote and their participation in the debate on that fund when that matter was in the House some time ago. That is the first point.The second point goes to the Council of Australian Governments, agreement on health and hospital funding, which was reached between the Commonwealth and the states at the end of last year. That agreement contained a $64 billion Australian healthcare agreement, which represented a 50 per cent increase on the previous healthcare agreement negotiated between the previous Liberal-National Party government and the states and territories. What has the opposition said about that COAG agreement? They have said they would not have signed it; they would not have provided that funding. This is where we get to the absolute core of the difference between our attitude to supporting investment in the health and hospital system of Australia and the attitude of those opposite. As part of that health and hospitals agreement, we provided $1.1 billion to train more doctors, nurses and other health professionals, $750 million to take pressure off emergency departments, $872 million for the first-ever preventative health partnership and half a billion in measures to provide additional subacute care. These are practical measures which the Commonwealth and the states and territories - Liberal and Labor - sat down and agreed together here in Parliament House in Canberra at the end of last year. But let it be stated clearly for the record that the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer - and I am pretty sure it was on radio, Joe - said that he would not have signed that agreement. In other words, in reality what the member for North Sydney and the Liberal Party said to state and territory governments and to the 700-plus hospitals across the country was, 'We are not going to be there at all.' - I appreciate the member for North Sydney's interjection because what the House would now want to know is which one in the $1.1 billion to train more doctors would he cut? - You say you would pay less. Which part would you pay less for? The $750 million to take pressure off emergency departments - would you cut that? I hear nothing. The $872 million for preventative health care -  - So here we have yet another case study of the opposition trying to walk both sides of the street. The motto of this modern Liberal Party is capital 'O' Opportunism - sounding as if they are concerned about an issue but when it comes to the substantive matter -  - The quantum of Commonwealth government funding for health and hospitals is of direct relevance to what happens at the Port Macquarie hospital, through the whole range of funding which we provided through the COAG agreement at the end of last year. Obviously, the Leader of the Nationals thinks that he can just pluck a bit of money from under a carpet somewhere and it will mysteriously find its way into a hospital emergency department. We have a different view. We have invested in the future of health and hospitals. We have done so in our payments, particularly targeted to outcomes measures in emergency departments. This is practical stuff. Those opposite have been caught out because they say they would cut the amount of money to be provided to the states and territories in these areas but -  - He is saying that investing in our hospitals is not spending money wisely. That is exactly what the shadow Treasurer is saying. I say this to the member for Lyne: in contrast to those who preceded him in the seat which he represents in this parliament, he has raised an important matter concerning the hospital in his electorate, and, in terms of the submission which he has provided to the Health and Hospitals Fund, which those opposite have opposed, I will come back to him on the status of the submission. I conclude by saying that those opposite (a) opposed the fund and (b) opposed the single largest Australian healthcare agreement signed between the Commonwealth government and the states. Once again, their hypocrisy is on full display.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. It is the case that hot and dry conditions have kept Murray inflows at historic lows and, regrettably, there is a low likelihood of significant improvement over the next few months. It is the case that the CSIRO, in its whole-of-basin sustainable yields report, did show that the Murray-Darling Basin and its environment will bear the brunt of future likely impacts of climate change and continuing weather patterns in south-eastern Australia, which see hotter conditions and drier conditions as a whole. The government have been consistent and decisive about what is needed to address this issue, and it is a serious issue. The government are investing $3.1 billion in purchasing water entitlements and some $5.8 billion in modernising irrigation infrastructure. We have purchased water from rivers in the Murray-Darling Basin for the first time ever and brought forward half a billion dollars to accelerate our water purchase program.We have secured a historic referral of powers from the states and passed legislation to deliver the first ever basin-wide plan in 2011. We are committed to projects worth $3.7 billion across the basin to improve water efficiency in irrigation and recently provided $5.6 million for on-farm water efficiency pilot projects and some $2 million from the Healthy Headwaters Program for on-farm irrigation technology. In difficult times, the government is getting on with this delivery.I am asked by the member: what has the response been to these measures? I have to say that the response has been pretty confusing, because the coalition has had 12 different positions on the issue of Murray-Darling Basin water. Let us count the 12 positions. They like counting things out over there, so let us count them. Position 1 was the member for Flinders supporting the government's buyback. He said, on 29 April 2008:We are pleased that _ they're involved in the buyback..Position 2 was on the same day when, at a doorstop, he said:The buyback won't help at all. It won't help the Murray. It can't help the Murray unless you make the efficiencies.Then, in position 3, he said in a media release that the buybacks are extreme, mentioning:Penny Wong's plans to rip the heart out of country Australia through her extreme farm buy-out plans.To add to the confusion, other opposition members who have a different view on what water policy should be have weighed in. The member for Calare said:Minister Wong's announcement of a $50 million water buyback is politics not policy. - But then the member for Sturt, who is interjecting across the chamber - and I am happy to quote him back to himself - said:There should have been a billion dollars being spent on returning environmental flows in the Murray-Darling Basin.But the problem for the member for Sturt was that he had not spoken about this policy position of the coalition to the member for Murray, who says that we should be restricting the buyback. She said in a press release:Minister Wong should conduct the buyback only on overallocated streams.The member for Mayo chimed in. On 891 ABC Adelaide on 10 October, he said: 'Speed up the buyback. We need to hasten these plans. We need to get the buyback happening more quickly'. Then, of course, we had the memorable contribution from the member for Bradfield, when he was asked on 31 July 2008 if he would consider compulsory acquisition. He said:Well I think that's the kind of thing that needs to be considered in different parts of the basin.This brings me to the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition had the view - and it was a different view from that of the member for Bradfield - that they should not consider compulsory acquisition. He said earlier:_ our plan is based on no acquisitions of water being other than from willing sellers.Now we get to position 10. As Parliamentary Secretary for Water, he said that the buyback was suddenly necessary:It is increasingly difficult to see how the Living Murray initiative can be met without the purchase of water for the environment by governments.Then we come to position No. 11. As shadow Treasurer last year, he said, 'Buy less water'. He said:Senator Wong is allocating more money for water buybacks than we would have allocated.Finally, we come to position No. 12. As opposition leader this year, he said, 'Buy more water'. He said:_ and we believe there is - then that water should be bought in order to preserve the health of the lower part of the system.If _ temporary water _ can be acquired _ to keep those lakes alive, then that should be done _This is a very serious issue and it needs a consistent public policy position. The public policy wanders around the coalition tactics group like a lonely white cloud because they are concerned with other things. That is the great problem here: the delivery of a meaningful, consistent and decisive program to deal with the significant issues that are faced in the Murray-Darling Basin is something this government is committed to, but the inconsistency of 12 different positions that have been held by the coalition shows that they simply are not up to the task.</DOC>

On the question of how we best examine what has happened with the Victorian bushfires most recently and what we can learn from them so as not to repeat those mistakes in the future, the judgment of the government is that the royal commission in Victoria should be allowed to proceed unfettered by an overlapping inquiry from the Commonwealth, whatever form that inquiry would take through the Commonwealth parliament. Secondly, the response of the government is that, given that the framework, or the scope, of the Victorian royal commission will deal with Victoria only, it is the Commonwealth's intention to approach each state and territory government to undertake their own investigation of their own natural disaster protection arrangements, including for bushfires.We are concerned here to learn properly from the experiences in Victoria. There are five other states and two territories in the country. Therefore, this matter of how we best deal nationally with the scourge of bushfires and other natural disasters and proper preparedness will be dealt with at the upcoming Council of Australian Governments meeting. It is important that the royal commission in Victoria proceed unfettered by a parallel and potentially overlapping inquiry at the Commonwealth level. Secondly, the judgment of the Commonwealth is that we need to make sure that proper investigatory arrangements are undertaken in each state and territory concerning their existing policy settings for dealing with natural disasters generally and bushfires in particular.The judgment of the government is that that is the right approach. It will be the approach that we discuss with heads of government of the states and territories at the upcoming Council of Australian Governments meeting and, subject to the deliberations at that meeting in terms of any further action which may be necessary in this House or elsewhere, we will be attentive to the contributions from other participants in that COAG meeting.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question and I congratulate her on the leadership that she has shown - and other members have shown as well - in respect to supporting the communities which have been so devastated by the Victorian fires. As the Prime Minister has indicated, the federal government will fully cooperate with and assist the deliberations of the royal commission in Victoria, which is commencing its public consultations today.The disaster in Victoria has been described as Australia's worst natural disaster, and certainly it is that in terms of the catastrophic loss of life and the extreme damage to property. But, regrettably, the description does not fit all of the fires because some of those fires, as we are now starting to learn, were deliberately lit. As incomprehensible as it is and as reprehensible as it is, as indicated by the attitude of all members in this House, regrettably it is the case. It has been estimated by the Australian Institute of Criminology that up to 50 per cent of fires in Australia are deliberately lit - at a cost of about $1.6 billion to the Australian economy. In that context it is necessary to have effective law enforcement measures, but it is also important to have effective prevention and deterrence measures in place. With that in mind I have established a national forum on the reduction of deliberate bushfires in Australia - the first of its kind. - It will be established and hold its first meeting on 24 March. - I would have thought that members were interested in this very important issue to address the crucially important issue of arson - The member for North Sydney then left the chamber. - I will inform my friend opposite of those who will be attending on 24 March. I have invited the Australian Institute of Criminology. I have invited the state and territory fire agencies. I have invited the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre. I have invited the state and territory police agencies and also the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council.The focus of this expert forum is going to be on: developing a consistent and robust criminal sanctions regime applicable around Australia; reducing access to fuels and materials; preventative education; identifying areas at risk; and promoting community safety initiatives. To answer a question raised earlier, yes, of course the details of this detailed advice and these deliberations will be provided to the Victorian royal commission but, more than that, it will also be referred to the Australia Emergency Management Committee, which will be meeting on the following week on 31 March. Consistent with the federal government's response to a coordinated all-hazards approach to natural disasters, the Rudd government is determined to have the strongest possible approach on prevention, deterrence and penalties. - In conclusion, I would like to indicate my appreciation to all state and territory agencies that are cooperating in this initiative. In the next two weeks we expect to see real progress in fighting this scourge of arson that so devastates our community.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I would draw his attention to the fact that over the 12 years in which the Liberal Party were in office, their great conspicuous failure was to not invest in the nation's infrastructure - a matter which was the subject of conspicuous and consistent reports from a range of agencies over the period of their tenure in office. As a result, when we moved to the various warnings which were delivered in the last several years by the Reserve Bank and others about inflationary pressures in the economy, they pointed to two things: inadequate investment in infrastructure and infrastructure bottlenecks on the one hand -  - It is good to see that the member for Higgins has leapt back into action today. Three days of self-discipline were too much for the member for Higgins, but we come to day 4 and he is back up the front.Then you have got the other thing which was pointed to, which was the underinvestment in skills. If you look at the overall need for productivity performance in the economy, you need to be investing in infrastructure and investing in skills, because the long-term economic mission of the government - and it should be of the nation - is to ensure that we are turbocharging long-term productivity growth. That is why, prior to the election, we committed ourselves to significant infrastructure investment. That is why, prior to the election, we committed ourselves to building an education revolution. These two enterprises come together with one objective: boosting long-term productivity growth.The honourable member refers to the infrastructure funds which we have dedicated for this purpose. Can I again draw the attention of the nation to the double standards of the opposition. Each of these infrastructure funds was voted against, in this parliament, by those opposite. They have opposed nation building, they have opposed economic stimulus, they have opposed infrastructure investment, and they stand here at the dispatch box today and pretend that they are concerned about the above. This is a political strategy designed to take political advantage of a global economic crisis. This government is prosecuting an economic strategy in order to cushion the impact of that crisis on Australian families and on jobs.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Bendigo for his question and for the efforts that he has made on behalf of his constituents in Bendigo. I also recognise the very significant work being done by the member for McEwen, the member for McMillan, the member for Indi, the member for Gippsland and the member for Ballarat. And I would like to recognise my colleagues from Victoria, many of whom, I know, are working very hard on these issues, which are still affecting so many people in Victoria.I would like to take this opportunity to update the House on both the Australian and Victorian governments' bushfire recovery and rebuilding efforts. It is now almost six weeks since that terrible day and the days that followed. Of course, although the immediate threat is over, every day is still a struggle for so many people - so many families who have lost, in some cases, many members of their families, friends, homes and possessions. It is still a very difficult time for people and will be for a considerable time to come.As the Prime Minister has said, the Australian government intends to be there every single step of the way, no matter how long it takes, to help to rebuild both people's lives and their communities. There is certainly a lot of work going on as we speak. I would particularly like to thank and recognise the work being done by my parliamentary secretary, the member for Maribyrnong, who has been on the ground over the last few weeks in the devastated fire communities, working particularly with the Victorian government and with the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority and its head, Christine Nixon, as they go around working with communities. As members will know, the royal commission that has been established began its consultations yesterday, and the Commonwealth has, of course, given its commitment to cooperate in every way possible. Just this week, my colleague the Minister for Tourism and the Premier of Victoria announced a $10 million package to encourage tourists back into the fire devastated areas of Victoria.I would like to give one example, that of a trout farmer in Buxton - I am sure the member for McEwen is familiar with this fellow - who is already getting his business back up and running. He has been cleaning up and doing an extraordinary job. He is just one example of a terrific businessperson trying to get himself back on his feet. I say to anybody listening today that there are many parts of these fire affected areas where you can visit and where people will be very happy to see you.I can inform the House that, as of today, personal hardship and distress payments - including almost 8,000 emergency payment grants - have been made, totalling around $5.9 million. Forty-seven million dollars in Australian government disaster recovery payments have been of immediate assistance to individuals and families. More than 1,300 properties have been registered under the demolition and clean-up program. Could I just mention and thank Grocon, the contractor that has got the job to coordinate the clean-up - they are doing this job at cost. We have a large number of case managers from Centrelink, from the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, from the Department of Human Services in Victoria and from non-government organisations, who are all providing one-on-one case management to fire affected families. There are farmers and small businesses now accessing grants, advisory services and low-interest loans. There is extra money for emergency relief. Extra assistance has been provided for mental health services. One of the lovely things happening is that, through the Community Recovery Fund, we are seeing the local footy clubs, tennis clubs, golf clubs and pony clubs already starting up again and rebuilding their clubhouses and grounds.I would like to take just a moment longer to particularly thank all of the Commonwealth agencies that have been involved in both the relief and the recovery effort to date - in particular, the very large numbers of people from the defence forces, the Australian Federal Police, Emergency Management Australia, Centrelink and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. There are many people here in Canberra working behind the scenes. I would particularly like to thank all of the people in my own department who have been working night and day to make sure that all of this is working smoothly - or as smoothly as possible - in what has been a very, very difficult situation. There has been a veritable army of people in a wide range of voluntary agencies and, of course, just the most extraordinary generosity of the Australian people donating to the appeal.I think this demonstrates that each and every one of us intends to be with the fire affected families and communities for as long as it takes.</DOC>

 - Here we have yet another example of the shadow Treasurer being in complete denial about the global recession. Let us just go through the international figures on car sales and look at the falls around the world over the year to February: in the UK, they fell by 22 per cent; in the United States, they fell by 40 per cent; in Japan, they fell by 24 per cent; and, in Canada, they fell by 22 per cent. They refuse to acknowledge -  - The world economy is experiencing the sharpest downturn in living memory, something that those opposite will not acknowledge. The consequence of that is they cannot support any of our measures to boost demand in the Australian economy. Our measures are boosting demand in the Australian economy through economic stimulus, which they oppose.There are some other figures out today. The ABS has figures out today on industry employment. They show something really interesting. We do not want to overstate these figures, but I think they are very important. These figures show that retail trade in Australia grew by 16,000 people in the three months through to February. I will tell the shadow minister what it fell by in the United States: 130,000 people.Those opposite refuse to acknowledge that, in the middle of a global recession, governments must act. This government has acted. It has acted decisively. They come into this House and say to us that we are involved in irresponsible spending, whilst at the same time they are giving $1.6 billion to the alcohol industry. How does that work? - This is yet another example of how out of touch they are. They value Porsches more than they value pensioners. When it comes to economic credibility, they simply have not got a clue. They are completely out of touch. The merchant banker there and the lawyer for merchant bankers over there do not know what life is like for the average person. They do not walk in the same shopping aisles as the average person, and the consequence of that is that they are not supporting important measures to bolster demand in the Australian economy. This government is. We make no apology for it, because it is the responsible course of action.The irresponsible course of action is not to act and, as a consequence, deepen the downturn. That is what happens if you do not act: you deepen the downturn. What happens then is that debt is higher because deficits are higher. So, by not acting and not supporting fiscal stimulus, they are arguing for a higher debt and higher deficits. The proof of all of this is their decision to support the alcohol industry and give it a bonus of $1.6 billion, whilst they come into this House and oppose bonuses of $900 for people on low and medium incomes. The hypocrisy of the opportunists opposite knows no bounds. All they have is a political strategy. We have a strategy in the national interest. The Leader of the Opposition has a strategy in his own self-interest, because he sits there hoping the economy goes down so that he can take political advantage of it. On this side of the House, we will continue to support the national interest in the interests of employment and growth in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. The World Bank overnight lowered its economic growth forecast for China. This is of direct relevance to the Australian economy. China is now expected to grow at 6.5 per cent in 2009. This is down from nine per cent in 2008 and 13 per cent in 2007. This is partly driven by weaknesses in the global economy causing significant falls in private sector investment. It has also been caused by falling Chinese exports. We have seen China's exports down 21 per cent year on year, on average, in the first two months of 2009. These are very large numbers with global significance. China's economic growth has a direct effect on Australia. China is Australia's largest trading partner. It takes 13.6 per cent of our exports, $31.4 billion in 2007-08.These results on China's exports follow a broader trend of falling world trade. Volumes of world trade in 2009 are predicted to contract for the first time since 1982. The fall in global trade highlights an important element of the upcoming G20 agenda, which is preventing emerging protectionism. The World Bank also released a report last night on protectionist measures that have been introduced since this crisis began. - The report indicates that 78 protectionist trade measures have been proposed or implemented since the start of the financial crisis. It is essential that G20 leaders make a firm commitment to avoid protectionist measures. - The World Bank President, Bob Zoellick, said yesterday:Leaders must not heed the siren song of protectionist fixes, whether for trade, stimulus packages, or bailouts. Economic isolationism can lead to a negative spiral of events such as those we saw in the 1930s _ - I note the rolling series of interjections from those opposite, who do not regard this crisis as real. It is a stark reminder of the fact that those opposite seem to exist in some sort of self-contained political bubble. The world is grappling with a real problem, a real crisis, and we are seeking as a world community to deliver responses to that crisis. Those opposite seem to be engaged in a political conversation known only to and understood only by themselves.Dealing with protectionism, whether it is financial protectionism or protectionism in goods and services, is of critical importance for the future. If we fail to do so, we will not be heeding the lessons of the 1930s. If we fail to do so and resort to new forms of financial protectionism then we will see the emergence of a new form of protectionism which would become the 21st century equivalent of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of the 1930s. These things must be avoided, and it requires, therefore, concerted global action and concerted global leadership in order to do so.On the domestic agenda, the government's response to the global economic crisis - this global economic storm - has been to embrace a course of action to reduce the impact on unemployment and on Australian families. We have done that in three specific areas under our economic stimulus strategy: first of all, to continue to take action in support of the stability of Australian financial markets, anchored in our guarantee to Australian deposit holders. On top of that, we are also investing in critical areas to support the Australian finance industry, most particularly through the Business Investment Partnership. We are, secondly, engaging in direct support to employment for 1½ million Australians who work in the Australian retail industry, through the support that we have provided to consumption and the payments we have made to pensioners, to carers, to veterans and to others, because those 1½ million jobs are important. On the debate just before about employment impacts across the economy: it has been important to see recent statements by some of our leading retailers about their plans to add to employment in the year ahead, which is remarkable given the stress which the economy generally is under as a consequence of the global recession. The third element of our strategy is to engage in long-term investment and infrastructure, in school building and in public housing, as well as energy insulation to ensure we are also doing our bit to draw down greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, what we are doing in addition to these three sets of measures is embracing new and additional measures to support those who, through no fault of their own, lose their job.These constitute the core elements of the government's strategy at home for dealing with the overall impact of the global recession on Australia. This must occur in harmony with what we do globally as well - which brings us back to the agenda which now looms for G20 leaders at the summit which will be held in London in a week or so - because each of the domestic measures that I have just referred to in my remarks to the House has direct parallel with international measures: firstly, financial markets and their stability globally, dealing with toxic assets, properly resourcing the International Monetary Fund and reforming its governance; secondly, dealing properly with coordinated fiscal stimulus worldwide so that all economies are raising activity at a time when the private sector is in retreat; thirdly, acting in concert with our partners to ensure that we are bringing about a proper regulatory system for the future; and fourthly, acting on protectionism as well.I conclude my remarks where I began as a response to the interjection by those opposite. Those opposite exist in a parallel universe. Those opposite exist in a universe completely disconnected from what is actually going on in the global economy and its roll-on consequences for Australians, their jobs, their families and their communities. The government strategy is clear cut, but I would say to those opposite - as, during the break, they wrestle with the rolling leadership tensions between the member for Higgins and the member for Wentworth - that the nation expects a little better of a party which seeks to put itself up as the alternative government of Australia. This is a time of deep national economic crisis. What we need is not simply an opposition which opposes everything and proposes nothing, an opposition which simply says that the best thing to do is to sit, wait and do nothing. What the nation expects is for leadership to emanate from this parliament to deal with the challenges which the global economy has delivered us. That is the government strategy. I would challenge those opposite to support such a strategy.</DOC>

 - I am taken by the Leader of the Opposition's reference to health priorities in Australia on a day when those opposite have voted to return $1.6 billion over time to the distilling industry through a tax loophole with a direct impact on hospital emergency services across Australia. They do not like this matter for debate. They do not wish to be confronted with the absolute hypocrisy of their position on the health debate in general and on the impact on families more generally, because the actions they have taken in the Senate to deliver a $1.6 billion gift to the alcohol industry of Australia have their direct consequence in the hospital emergency departments of Australia. - I listened very carefully to the intervention by the Leader of the Opposition. It goes to the fiscal capacity of government to deliver health services. If you are going to rip $1.6 billion out of the budget by returning that amount of money to the alcohol industry, where are your priorities, Leader of the Opposition? I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that the Liberal Party have demonstrated themselves to be so out of touch on the question of the measures they have taken in the Senate to provide these alcopops to young Australians, young girls in particular, by the irresponsible actions they have taken. Each and every one of them should just hang their head in shame. This is the ultimate triumph of their ideology. It says, at the end of the day: just oppose anything which might add up to a tax impost, even if it is on the alcohol industry, even if it deals with protecting our young people, even if it deals with the burden felt by our emergency services departments across Australia. - Thanks to the Liberal Party, what we have is teenage girls now being able to use their pocket money to pay for alcopops, alcoholically powerful drinks, because those opposite wanted to give a tax gift to the alcohol industry in Australia. Any responsible Australian would hang their head in shame at the decision the opposition have taken at the behest of the alcohol industry in Australia. - Not only did those opposite, when in office, pull a billion dollars out of the public hospital system of Australia but they have now returned $1.6 billion to the alcohol industry. What does that say about priorities? In their heart of hearts, each of them over there knows that what they have done is wrong. They actually know that what they have done is wrong. That is why this debate hurts them so much individually. It is the triumph of their ideology over what is decent and practical common sense. When you look at the events of this week in parliament, what we have seen is the Liberal Party and the National Party united on just two measures: how to cut workers' wages, through their position on Work Choices, and how to cut the price of alcopops for young Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. We on this side of the House are concerned that the decision of the Liberal Party means that alcopops will be sold around the country at lower prices in just a few weeks time. Every single one of those teenagers is going to be saying cheers to Malcolm Turnbull for one of the biggest shouts in the country - all on his ledger. There is a very serious issue at stake here. Yesterday the Liberal Party wrote a cheque to the distillers not just for $300 million but for $1.6 billion into the future. The member for Dickson and the Leader of the Opposition are prepared to advocate for that $300 million as hush money for the distillers. -  - I understand why the opposition is sensitive about this. The opposition has allowed the distillers to express their largesse. The distillers will say that we can, at their discretion, keep the $300 million so that they can make billions and billions in profits years into the future. This is hush money and the Liberal Party has fallen for that trick. We are not going to fall for that trick. Because of the Liberal Party, $1.6 billion into the future has been lost. That is not acceptable. We know that Mr Turnbull -  - If there is any doubt in people's minds about whose idea this was, I table a letter from the distillers which makes it clear that they, in their largesse, will allow us to keep $300 million if we just give them a teensy-weensy tax break into the future of several billions of dollars. We are not prepared to do that. We are not prepared to see the price of alcopops reduced. They will be called 'Malcopops' around the country into the future because of the position of the Leader of Opposition. We want to make sure that young people get protection and are not saying cheers to Mr Turnbull at every 18th birthday party around the country. - I table the letter.</DOC>

 - What it is an example of is responsible economic management. -  - Putting in place a vehicle to support employment for 150,000 Australians is not a laughing matter. Those opposite do not understand the magnitude of the challenge. Foreign banks have not been able to guarantee to the Treasury that they will keep funding syndicated loans in this country, and there is a need for such a vehicle. We are putting it in place in a responsible way, with the governance that is required, to ensure that we do our best to support employment in this vital sector, because if foreign banks do withdraw then that will affect property prices across the board and it will result in a massive increase in unemployment in this country.What those opposite do not understand is the nature of the challenge. First of all we have had the World Bank again revise down growth forecasts. They have revised down the growth figures for China to something like 6.5 per cent. China has been the engine room that has been boosting this economy and the commodity boom for a long time. This is going to be very damaging for the Australian economy. It sends a shock right into the economy. And we have got overnight from the IMF the release of further revised-down forecasts, the fourth revision in a few months. The secretary-general has indicated that once again there will be a further revision down and is putting forward a much sharper contraction in the economy. That is the background to putting in place the Australian Business Investment Partnership, which we are doing with the best corporate governance, which has been put in place with the advice of some of the best minds in business.I understand the proposition that is being put to me but the decision about that, as I said earlier, is in my hands about whether it is being disruptive. But I really think that perhaps one of the things that the House could look at is that, when people are offered the opportunity to state a point of order, it is simply what the point of order is; it is not an opportunity to add. I will invite people if I need clarification. To paraphrase parts of a question is not in any way making the case of relevance - or not any more accurate. In fact, my concern about the particular point of order - and this gets to matters that have been discussed this week - is whether there is an inference that should be dealt with in some other form by the House in the part of the question that was highlighted by the member for Cook. The Treasurer is responding to the question and the Treasurer has the call. - The partnership's lending decisions will not be made by politicians. There is an independent board which will use guidelines, which will use best practice. That is exactly what will happen. The honourable member opposite knows that but he is seeking to do the big smear. Whether it is the Economic Security Strategy, our Nation Building and Jobs Plan, our bank guarantee or now this partnership, or the motor vehicle partnership, they cannot support one positive initiative to support employment and growth in the Australian economy. So it will be on their heads if this vehicle is not established and the consequence is that someone who would have been eligible for funding cannot get it because they would not support it in the Senate. It will be on their heads.This government has the guts to take the tough decisions. We took a decision yesterday on executive pay, a decision they could not take in 12 years. We will take the hard decisions. We have taken the hard decision with the bank guarantee. The member opposite knows that if it were not for the bank guarantee we would not have any stability at all in our financial sector. We took that decision and we took it early. We took the hard decision to put forward an Economic Security Strategy last October when most countries around the world were not even acting. Again in February we got ahead of the curve when we brought down the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, well before many other countries in the Western world. We did it because we understand the nature of this challenge, which will be underlined by the IMF forecast which will come out overnight.Our conscience is clear. We will do what is right by the nation, and what is right by the nation is the measures we have taken, and we have taken them on the best possible advice. Those opposite are only acting in their political self-interest. They are not acting in the national interest, and they should be condemned.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As I said earlier in question time today, in a party of disunity - that is, the Liberal Party - there are only two things which have caused them to be united this week. One is their agreement to cut the wages of working Australians because of their ideological commitment to Work Choices. The second is to cut the prices of alcopops. Those have been the two things which have been the unity ticket - the only surviving unity ticket - within the Liberal Party this week as the parliament draws closer to the recess.On 24 November 2007, Australians walked into the ballot boxes around the country and voted to abolish the Liberal Party's unfair Work Choices legislation. There could not have been a clearer mandate for a government to act. Today, the Senate is debating the legislation to end Work Choices. Those opposite, Liberals and Nationals, cannot make up their minds. They are split between the two enduring factions: the purists and the pretenders - the purists, who want to go out there and declare what they actually believe, which is that Work Choices should be the nation's legislation for our workplaces for the future, and the pretenders, who seek to push that to one side in order to take the political pain for themselves away for a season at least.It is now almost 500 days since Australian voters decisively rejected an industrial relations system that bent all the rules in the system away from the interests of workers and in the direction of employers. That system was wrong. They got the balance wrong. We went to the people last time around and said we would get the balance right through our approach to industrial relations. We put that to the people in great detail. The people voted for it. Yet those opposite continue to frustrate these measures in the Senate.Australians voted for a fair and balanced industrial relations system. They voted for a system that builds a strong safety net. They voted for a system that gives employees a right to bargain with the employer. They voted for a system that protects them from being unfairly sacked. These are the key elements of the system which we seek to replace Work Choices with but, 500 days later, those opposite continue to deny the mandate given to this government to bring about this change.Again we see these tensions on the part of those opposite in the public debate today. We have the Leader of the Opposition this morning on radio still threatening to vote to keep Work Choices alive. Honourable members might appreciate what he actually had to say:If Julia Gillard is so stubborn that she is not prepared to give any ground then she may not get her bill through the Senate and it may not be passed at all.That is kind of the pretend position. But, if you want some purity, of course, you have to go to the member for Warringah. He chipped in on Sky this morning - onya, Tone! - and said:If all of our amendments are scorned by the government, we will be against the bill.And of course we know where the other pretender, the member for Higgins, stands on this. He says:If the bill is not changed in these essential respects, then the Liberal Party and the National Party should vote it down.They are the positions on offer on the part of those opposite.What we know for a fact is this: when the member for Higgins replaces the member for Wentworth as the Leader of the Opposition, it will be like Frankenstein having the electrodes reconnected as far as Work Choices is concerned. That is what is going to happen. It is in the Liberal Party's DNA. It is doubly in the DNA of the member for Higgins - we all know that and he still says that publicly. But there they will be, putting the old electrodes onto the Work Choices system again - if they get the chance, back in government - to bring it back to life. That is what it is all about.What the Australian people will be carefully reflecting on in the coming debates is that, when the member for Higgins replaces the member for Wentworth - and it is a matter of time, not a matter of 'if' - as the Leader of the Opposition, the agenda on Work Choices will be clear. The purists will have replaced the pretenders, and the agenda for actually bringing back Work Choices will be there for all to see.But what about the 11 million Australian workers who are the direct recipients of the rough justice that will be delivered by Work Choices? What will happen to them? As they engage in their internal political debate - Higgins versus Wentworth, Wentworth versus Higgins - not a passing thought is given to those workers and their desire for some basic protection and a basic safety net in the period going forward. The most basic interest they have right now is this: a basic right to ensure that they at least have protection when it comes to redundancy. Those opposite, in Work Choices, stripped that away and that is the system which those opposite wish to re-establish and replace as the industrial relations system for the future. The former 'Minister for Work Choices', the current shadow Treasurer, knows that to be absolutely true, as the pretenders once again try to cover up for the purists and pretend that that was somehow not part of the Work Choices regime.What I cannot understand in this entire debate is how the Leader of the Opposition could stand up, only a few months ago, and say that Work Choices was dead. How could standing up and saying that, and the shenanigans currently underway in the Senate and prospectively in the House, be in any way consistent? Consistency is what people expect in our national political life. Instead they have an epistle of opportunism on the part of the Leader of the Opposition.Then on the question of unfair dismissal he says clearly, in black and white, that the government has a mandate when it comes to our proposals on unfair dismissal. Yet what they now seek to do in the Senate is to undermine those very proposals. We have a consistent approach on this. What we have on the part of the Leader of the Opposition - the temporary Leader of the Opposition, the current Leader of the Opposition - is one thing writ large: opportunism, opportunism and opportunism squared. People in this country expect some decency -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition says we are so hopeless on this, on industrial relations. I would say to him, as he rises to address the television cameras next time, I suppose, rather than -  -  - I do not know if those opposite have noticed this but, whenever he asks a question, he does not actually ask it of us; he asks it of the camera. But that is just something to note on the way through.What we know about this Leader of the Opposition is that, on every thread of consistency, he has been demolished on the industrial relations debate. The member for Bradfield stuck hard to the position - the right-wing position of the Liberal Party - both internally and in his external declarations. He was a purist. He remains a purist. And he was replaced by the supreme pretender.</DOC>

 - The opposition do live in a parallel universe, they really do. They come in here and pretend that there has been no substantial revenue write-down and that the global financial crisis has had no impact on the bottom line of the budget, when the truth is that budget revenues have been written down by $115 billion. Of course, they quietly do admit in the corridors that they would have to borrow because of that write-down. They do admit that. If they did not borrow, what would they do? They would either have to cut spending savagely or put up taxes massively. What the government is doing is the responsible thing. It is the responsible thing to have a temporary deficit and to borrow for economic stimulus. Every responsible and respected body in the world recognises that in these circumstances, as I described before, it is responsible to borrow to stimulate the economy when demand is suffering such a sharp shock. That is the situation.The member seeks to claim that there is some crowding-out effect going on because we are borrowing to cover the loss in revenue and to stimulate the economy. There is not a shred of evidence of that at all. I can cite the Governor of the Reserve Bank or the Deputy-Governor of the Reserve Bank as the authority for that because it was said at the parliamentary committee, which the member himself attended. He is seeking to assert there is some crowding-out effect going on and the consequence of that is that interest rates are higher for domestic borrowers than they would otherwise be. This is a bit rich coming from those opposite who gave the country 10 interest rate rises in a row. This is a bit rich. They gave us 10 interest rate rises in a row on the back of a spending spree in the middle of a mining boom, and during the middle of all that they could not find the money to invest in infrastructure and education. They have no qualifications to be making the sorts of assessments that are being put forward by the shadow Treasurer. I know he was on the phone the other day seeking to speak to Treasury officials about borrowing. If he really got the good oil, he would have found out that the assertion he just made is ridiculous.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I know that he wants to see fairness for Australian workers in his electorate. As members of this House would now be aware, the Senate is considering the Fair Work Bill - working through it amendment by amendment. But as members of this parliament would also be aware, the key debate emerging in the Fair Work Bill is the debate caused by the Liberal Party around unfair dismissal provisions. Let us be very clear about this. In 2007, the Labor Party took to the election a crystal clear policy about unfair dismissals - published, circulated, crystal clear - and that policy said:A Rudd Labor Government will introduce a simple system for determining who can bring an unfair dismissal claim based on three circumstances:an employee who is employed by an employer who employs 15 or more employees must have been employed for 6 months;an employee who is employed by an employer who employs fewer than 15 employees must have been employed for 12 months;That is crystal clear policy and the policy that was in our election policy Forward with Fairness. As the Liberal Party twist and turn to try and clutch onto Work Choices and its continuation, the Liberal Party are contesting the ability of the Rudd Labor government to honour its promise to the Australian people. Extraordinarily, today, we have seen the Liberal leader in the Senate suggest that, really, this all does not matter very much, that if the parliament adopted the Liberal Party's amendment it would not matter very much. I quote the Liberal leader in the Senate, 'Those extra five employees, I do not think will make much difference in the minds of fair thinking Australians.' That is what he had to say. When it comes to the Liberal Party, never watch what they say, always watch what they do. Earlier this week, I exposed in this parliament the planned Liberal Party redundancy rip-off, where they had put forward amendments in the Senate which, if adopted, would have ripped redundancy rights off 200,000 working Australians - a rip-off of 200,000 working Australians that the Liberal Party cooked up this week.On the amendments that they have cooked up on unfair dismissal, as they twist and turn to keep Work Choices, let's just be very clear about what this difference means. I am advised that we are talking about a difference for 700,000 employees - 700,000 employees that the Liberal Party amendment would make a difference for in terms of their rights on unfair dismissal. So, when you are listening to the Liberal Party, never listen to what they say, because telling the Australian people the truth about workplace relations is something they have never done; look for the facts. The facts are: what they are proposing in the Senate would change arrangements as proposed by the Labor Party for 700,000 working Australians. Well, we will not let them rip Australians off from opposition the way they ripped Australians off from government. We will not let them do that. The party of rip-offs in government is becoming the party of rip-offs in opposition. We will not let them do it.As the Prime Minister says, as they embrace Work Choices, as they revel in the rip-offs, the Liberal Party are divided between the purists, who were out loud and proud as Work Choices supporters, and the pretenders. Of course, we know the member for Goldstein is one of the purists, because he was out today and, in relation to the Fair Work Bill, he said, 'All of these initiatives that go beyond Work Choices are all things to increase the power of the unions, and it is unacceptable.' - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition shouts, 'That's right.' So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has just verified in the parliament that the Liberal Party are opposed to any initiative that goes beyond Work Choices. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for confirming in the parliament today that they do not want to see any modicum of fairness; they want to stick with Work Choices. She, I acknowledge, is a purist.Then, of course, we have seen some of the pretenders out and about today. Most particularly, we have seen the shadow minister for finance, Senator Coonan. She is a pretender. She said, 'We have said all along that we recognise the government's mandate,' while she walks in and out of the Senate voting on amendments that are purpose designed to deny that mandate and keep Work Choices.But let's come to the biggest pretender of them all, the Leader of the Opposition, who now faces a fundamental question of character as this parliament deals with the Fair Work Bill, because this is about the rights of working Australians. It is about whether the Liberal Party are out there publicly, loudly endorsing Work Choices or whether they are scurrying around quietly supporting it. But it has also become a test of the honesty of the Leader of the Opposition, a question of character for him, because last December he said: 'Labor took a proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to the election and won, so we must respect that.' Having uttered those words, there are only two choices for the Leader of the Opposition: he can stand up and say, 'In December I did not tell the Australian people the truth because I am not a man who tells the truth,' or he can ensure that the Liberal Party in the Senate vote as he instructed them to vote last December. There are only two choices here for the Leader of the Opposition: he can expose himself to the Australian people as a dishonest man or he can instruct his senators to vote for the Fair Work Bill. We wait to see what choice he is going to make.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, because it is almost parallel to the point I was making before about Work Choices and the division between the purists and the pretenders. - No, it is highly relevant to the question that has just been asked, because on the question of jobs and Work Choices, which extends right across the employment market, we had the purist, the member for Bradfield, unseated by the pretender, the member for Wentworth - and we can see where they now stand on Work Choices - and on emissions trading the same thing, because the Leader of the Opposition sought to unseat -  - On the question of emissions trading, when the member for Wentworth was seeking to unseat the member for Bradfield as Leader of the Opposition, he did so on the basis of saying he was going to be green on the question of emissions trading.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. The substantial question that is now raised in this parliament as it deals with the Fair Work Bill is a question about the character of the Leader of the Opposition, what his word to the Australian people is worth. On the question of whether the word of the Leader of the Opposition is worth anything, the signs are not very good. We know from last December he gave his word to the Australian people, in a very instructive and discursive interview with Dennis Shanahan of the Australian, when he said:Our principles are enduring, but we must frame our policies in the light of changing circumstances and, most importantly, in the light of the judgement of the people delivered at the election - which we heard loud and clear.Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition. I am going to concede to the House that he was trying to make a point. He went on to say:So while I believe - as would most economists - I do not agree with him on that but it is his quote - that unfair dismissal laws add to the cost of employing people, nonetheless Labor took a proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to the election and won.So we must respect that.Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition. Are those words worth anything? On the question of whether the words of the Leader of the Opposition are worth anything, I would refer the House to an interview with Alan Jones today. It is very instructive. Mr Jones put to the Leader of the Opposition a proposition about Work Choices, and Mr Turnbull said in response, 'The person who said Work Choices was dead was Brendan Nelson.' That is very interesting, isn't it? Because I have a transcript from the Leader of the Opposition as recent as 5 March in which he said:Work Choices is dead. We accepted the verdict of the people at the last election.At some point in all this opportunism, in all this twisting and turning, in all these statements to the Australian people, the Leader of the Opposition is going to run out of rope and he is going to have to declare his hand and make a decision - and that point is coming in the Senate later today. The Leader of the Opposition will be exposed as a man in the embrace of Work Choices if his senators vote against the Fair Work Bill, and he will be exposed as a man whose word is worth nothing. This is now a question of character for the Leader of the Opposition.On the question of character and lack of honesty and the lack of principles of the Liberal Party in relation to Work Choices, I would refer members in the House to a recent report of the Auditor-General. It is very instructive. The Auditor-General's recent audit report No. 24: The Administration of contracting arrangements in relation to government advertising November 2007 audited two separate Work Choices campaigns - one for more than $49 million in 2005 and one for more than $63 million in 2007. They worked their way through the probity arrangements in relation to these campaigns. -  - They do not like talking about honesty; I understand that.The member for Flinders then left the chamber -  - This audit report deals with the shadowy work of the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications in relation to the Work Choices advertising campaign. The report finds things that it says are deeply disturbing, including the following: contracts not signed prior to work commencing, budgets blown out by huge amounts without authorisation, poor documentation and sometimes no documentation.Then this audit report reveals the Liberal Party all-stars being involved in this campaign - Liberal Party connections such as Dewey &amp; Horton and Brandmark all receiving substantial contracts through deeply flawed processes. The report says:As the contract with Dewey &amp; Horton was not finalised until after the completion of all major elements of the campaign, the contract manager could not have been certain of the requirements of the sub-contracting regime that could be included in that contract.All the work is done and then the contract is finalised - you know, a mates' arrangement, Liberal Party all-stars: the values of the Liberal Party on display. The report goes on to state:Where decisions were made by the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications to engage consultants, the successful consultants were advised immediately by the committee or, alternatively, by the Government Communications Unit shortly after. In reality this practice resulted in the creation of contractual arrangements between the department and the successful tenderer.The report goes on to complain about 'no documented assessment of proposals or short lists of tenderers'. It goes on to complain that:A selection process was completed and a letter of engagement issued by the department within 10 hours of the portfolio's minister's office requesting the department -  - Yes, it is about your track record, Joe, and it is a shadowy one. What we know from this Auditor-General's report and what we know from the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition is that honesty and the Liberal Party do not belong in the same sentence, particularly when one is talking about workplace relations. We know that with taxpayers' money, through this shadowy process, they paid for all this propaganda before the election. But, despite all of the mouse pads and all of the pens, they did not convince the Australian people of Work Choices. Today is the day to bury Work Choices. We are waiting for the decision of the Leader of the Opposition. We are waiting to see how his senators vote across the way. We are waiting to find out what his word is worth, whether this track record of dishonesty by the Liberal Party is going to continue in relation to Work Choices.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. A number of challenges are faced by farmers, including adapting to climate change, dealing with exports and dealing with the challenges for infrastructure -  - Wait till you hear what your leader said. Just wait! - I hold the portfolio of fisheries as well, and he takes to the bait! On the issue of climate change, described by the National Farmers Federation as perhaps the biggest challenge facing agriculture in Australia, the government has provided a clear pathway through on Australia's farming future, making sure that, through research and development, farmers are being given a way of interacting and being part of the process in reducing emissions, while still improving their own productivity. At the same time, from those opposite we face the challenge of working out 'Is there bipartisan support or is there not?' as we go through each of these measures. We have calls opposite, from the member for Goldstein and the Leader of the Opposition, for tougher action. We have calls for weaker action - from the member from Goldstein and the Leader of the Opposition. We also have calls from the shadow minister for agriculture for no action at all being taken in Australia, and we have calls from the member for Tangney for action instead to be taken in outer space.They have arrived at a target. Their target is both higher than ours and lower than ours. The answer to how they could arrive at that is quite simple: those opposite have a target that is not a number but a person sitting at the table opposite us. That is the one target that those behind him can agree on.The hypocrisy, though, does not only go to dealing with climate change. We have it as well on questions that were even asked yesterday, on export subsidies. The shadow minister for agriculture just said on exports: 'Look at what you're doing with the subsidies.' Think of a previous minister for agriculture, who now leads the National Party, who, in a statement, said these words:We give a high priority to eliminating domestic and export subsidies, which continue to distort world markets.He called for the elimination of those very subsidies when he held the same portfolio. That is the Leader of the Nationals.At the same time, we have the infrastructure issues and the calls that have been made for so long by those opposite. The Leader of the Nationals calls for more money for country schools, and then votes against it. The shadow minister for agriculture calls for more money for farmers, and then votes against it. We have calls for more money for roads, and then they vote against it. The member for Hinkler, who was being very sincere, I think, in his calls for doing something about level crossings, was then compelled, as a member of the coalition, to vote against that money coming through for level crossings.Only this morning, Senator Joyce said, 'When he refers to spending, he refers to ridiculous issues such as ceiling insulation, boom gates and sundry payments to sundry people.' Boom gates? What are the boom gates he is referring to if that is not an objection to doing something about level crossings? You can go through the list, electorate by electorate, of the level crossings that have been given boom gates in the state of Queensland for those opposite, including in the electorates of Herbert, Maranoa, Wide Bay and Kennedy. You can go through the country and you can see the popular level crossings that finally something is being done about, only to be consistently opposed by those opposite.A year ago those opposite were backgrounding against their then leader, claiming that he did not stand for anything. So their new strategy is to stand for everything, no matter how contradictory: take tougher action on climate change, take no action, take action in outer space; yesterday, they were complaining about us keeping their deadline on export subsidies but, in government, they called to eliminate them; they demanded support for country schools, roads and farmers but then vote against those same measures. They are out of ideas, out of touch, out of control.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. At a time when the global recession washes over Australia it is important not only that the government provide leadership but also that the parliament provide leadership to get Australia through these troubled times, and that is what we have been doing, of course, with the Economic Security Strategy and the Nation Building and Jobs Plan to help Australian jobs. And that is what we want to continue to do with the Australian Business Investment Partnership - an initiative in a sector with $150,000 jobs on the line, an initiative the Leader of the Opposition is determined to oppose.It is one thing when the Leader of the Opposition tries to wreck government policy to save his own job; it is another when he risks the jobs of thousands of other Australians to do so. There is no clearer demonstration of the Leader of the Opposition's approach - which is to say anything but do nothing - than their response to the government's stimulus packages. On 14 October, honourable members might recall the Leader of the Opposition setting out the coalition's position on the Economic Security Strategy. He said:_ we are not going to argue about the composition of the package or quibble about it. It has our support. It will provide a stimulus to the economy, that's for certain.And honourable members might not recall that he went on to say, 'But in any event, much of it, if not most of it, will be spent.' This is the same Leader of the Opposition who said, on 4 March:Now you'll remember that last year we said the cash splash in December would be saved rather than being spent. In other words, it wouldn't be an effective _ stimulus.The same bloke said both things. The Leader of the Opposition is taking the approach that, if you take many positions on every question facing the nation, one of them is bound to be right. That is his approach. And he is also taking to heart the old adage that even a broken clock is right twice a day, and his leadership is certainly broken because he is putting his job in front of the jobs of so many thousands of Australian families.I am asked about the government's plans to cushion the impact of the global recession on Australia. As well as the initiatives that have been mentioned, it is also important that the government's legislation to crack down on serious cartel conduct pass the parliament. There is plenty of expert commentary to note that, in difficult economic times, cartel conduct increases. Cartels rip off consumers and are unfair to businesses doing the right thing. Can I say, in fairness, how encouraging it has been to hear the support of the opposition. The shadow minister, the member for Cowper - my honourable friend the member for Cowper - indicated support for the government's cartel legislation. He said:I believe that if an executive from the big end of town is ripping off the Australian public, he should face the consequences.And the Liberal senators on the Senate Standing Committee on Economics supported a unanimous report recommending that our bill be passed. So imagine my surprise when I read in the Financial Review that an opposition backbencher rose in the Liberal Party room to oppose support for the government's cartel bill, to oppose cracking down on cartels. I am indebted to the Financial Review for letting us know it was the member for Higgins. This is a concern, because we all know that, when the member for Higgins talks, the member for Wentworth jumps. We all know that is how it works. We saw that in the jobs and nation building package, we saw it in emissions trading. The Leader of the Opposition needs to assure us that he is not going to let the tail wag the dog this time. Show a bit of leadership and stand up to the member for Higgins and confirm the opposition's support for cartel conduct.We know from the financial review that the other member to talk in the Liberal Party room against cracking down on cartel conduct was our old friend the member for Mackellar. Perhaps the member for Mackellar used the same argument that she did in the House. That argument was that cartels are not all bad; they help keep the value of diamonds high. Talk about that for being in touch! The Leader of the Opposition needs to stop letting the tail wag the dog. He needs to back the government's commonsense approach and back Australian small business and families. He needs to start putting the interests of Australian workers ahead of his own self-interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. I know he, like other members on this side of the House, is standing up for the delivery of the biggest single school modernisation program in Australia's history - good for education, good for the future of our schools and good for local jobs. That is what this plan has been designed for, not just for our primary schools but also for our secondary schools in terms of the amount of money which has been dedicated to the building of science centres and language centres, as well as what we have done in the National School Pride program, in order to provide support for P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs to get on with the essential task of school maintenance.What the government stands for is a program which delivers funding support to 9½ thousand schools across Australia: in New South Wales, 3,109 schools, $4.3 billion; in Victoria, 2,288 schools, $3.2 billion; in Queensland, 1,713 schools, $3.7 billion; in Western Australia, 1,065 schools, $1.5 billion; in South Australia, 795 schools, $1.2 billion; in Tasmania, 277 schools, $370 million; up in the Territory, 187 schools, $200 million; and, in the ACT, 128 schools, $230 million. We on this side of the chamber are delivering support to schools right across the Australian nation. For me, it defies any understanding as to why those opposite would stand resolutely opposed to delivery of $15 billion to the schools of Australia, both government and non-government, to make sure that we can get out there and support our kids with the infrastructure they need for the 21st century, the best schools possible, as well as supporting local jobs.The member for Flynn asked me about threats to this program. Of course, the biggest single threat to this program lies in the absolute, total opposition of those opposite. Those opposite are not engaged. As we said earlier in the debate today, they are engaged instead in a parallel universe. Their interest is politics. Their interest is to say that negative economic growth in Australia is the result of the Australian government, not the global recession. Their political agenda is to say that, were they in government, they would not engage in temporary deficit and temporary borrowing - when we know that they would. Their political strategy is to hope like hell the global recession gets worse and the number of unemployed increases so they can then blame the Australian government for that. That in a nutshell is the strategy. That is what they talk about each day in their increasingly well-attended tactics meetings. Honourable members, none of that equals an economic strategy. None of it equals a strategy to support the unemployed. None of it equals a strategy to support our local schools. It is only about supporting the employment of one person - that is, the Leader of the Opposition.It is not just this Leader of the Opposition who is on this bandwagon. I was reading the other day about the attitude of the Liberal National Party in Queensland. I would like to know whether the Liberal National Party in Queensland support or oppose the biggest school modernisation program in Queensland's history - 1,713 schools in Queensland and $3.7 billion. We know that Mr Turnbull and the Leader of the National Party are opposed to it here in Canberra. I presume the same is the case in Queensland as well. What I cannot understand is what will happen in terms of the maintenance of effort across state and territory governments nationwide. This is an important point. We have said that we will implement this program nationwide if state and territory governments maintain effort - that is, their existing investment program in schools across the country. Instead, the state Liberal National Party in Queensland have said they will pull out $1 billion each year from the Queensland state budget. So where is that going to be dealt? Where is it going to hurt? Who is going to be sacked as a result - which teachers, which nurses and which police? Mr Springborg's campaign in Queensland rests on a $1 billion cut to the state budget, denying that it would result in thousands of job sackings across Queensland, which is an absolute, total untruth.Mr Springborg, of the Liberal National Party, acting in tandem with those opposite, was asked this question the other day: where is the $1 billion coming from? For the benefit of those opposite, have a little listen to this. The answer from the Liberal National Party leader was: 'I mean, the amounts that are identified, the amounts that, of course, you know, we will be, will be looking at amounts of money which we are going about finding.' That was the definitive budget policy statement of the Leader of the Liberal National Party in Queensland. Joh Bjelke-Petersen has now come back to life in the form of Lawrence Springborg. He is being channelled. I cannot make any sense of that statement. Nobody else can make any sense of that statement. But why is it relevant to our deliberations here? It goes to the maintenance of effort on the part of the Queensland government. Every state and territory government signed up in this place to maintaining state effort. I have heard no such commitment from the Liberal National Party in Queensland. I have heard no such commitment as to whether they actually support this program in the first place. I have heard no explanation as to where the $1 billion that they are going to take out of the state budget is coming from.I say to those opposite: the nation actually wants us to get on with reducing the impact of the global recession on Australia. The nation wants us to act in a responsible fashion, to build jobs, to build through the modernisation of schools, to get on with the business of building houses needed to bring down homelessness and to invest in energy efficiency in the ceiling insulation of homes right across Australia - building jobs, great for education and great for the future. We are left instead in this question time with the dwindling and pathetic spectacle of a drowning and dying man, the Leader of the Opposition in this place, who, as he struggles and grasps his way towards the winter recess - towards the spring recess; towards the recess through until budget -  - He says I do not know what time of year it is. I would say that the member for Higgins knows what time of year it is - it is the time to roll the Leader of the Opposition. That is the posture on the part of those opposite. As the Leader of the Opposition feels the warm breath of the member for Higgins breathing down his neck, I say to the Leader of the Opposition that there is a core reason why he is in such political strife - that is, a complete lack of consistency all the way through. Last year he supported economic stimulus -  - It is again interesting that the member for Higgins' numbers man actually comes to the dispatch box. There is a core reason why the Leader of the Opposition is in near terminal trouble, and that is because he has no consistency of position. Last year he supported economic stimulus; this year he opposes it. Last year he supported emissions trading; this year he opposes it. Last year he supported the removal of Work Choices; this year he supports the continuation of Work Choices. Is it any wonder that this man's leadership is in terminal trouble? Those opposite know exactly what I am talking about. The internal rabble which now constitutes the once great party of Menzies is there for all to see.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I note that in the question which has just been asked by the Leader of the Opposition he makes no reference to the fact that this is a global economic recession and that the consequence, therefore, is that every responsible government in the world is seeking to respond to this global economic recession by taking action to reduce the impact on jobs within their economies and on small businesses and other businesses within their economies. That is this government's strategy; it is the responsible course of action.I would also draw the honourable member's attention to the following. In terms of the impact of the measures taken by the government, I would draw his attention to the 1½ million Australians who, for example, work in retail and the impact of the government's measures on retail sales in Australia - 4.5 per cent higher than they were in November 2008. Contrast that with the following: a 2.5 per cent fall in the United States, a 3.1 per cent fall in Japan, a 2.2 per cent fall in Germany, a 1.7 per cent fall in New Zealand and a 3.1 per cent fall in Canada. And that is a direct consequence of government intervention in the economy.Secondly, if we go to the whole question of building approvals and what is going on out there in the housing construction sector, the government has also taken action by trebling the first home owners grant, the first home owners boost. Those opposite always remain silent at this point because they do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha on this one, because the first home owners boost has been singularly successful in supporting activity in the housing sector. I draw the honourable member's attention to this fact - that total building approvals rose for the second consecutive month in March, by 3.5 per cent. The increase in house approvals, up 3.4 per cent in March, is the highest monthly rise since March 2007. I would ask the honourable member to contrast that with what is happening with the housing sector in other economies also simultaneously affected by the global economic recession.Furthermore, let us look at the impact of these interventions on the most recent survey of business confidence. The NAB business survey confirmed that the stimulus that we have delivered so far through this series of measures by the government is stabilising business confidence. Business confidence was broadly unchanged in April. I quote from the survey: 'The results of the April survey represent the most encouraging set of numbers for some time.'What do these various pieces of data indicate? They indicate the impact of measures taken by this government to cushion this economy from the worst effect of the global economic recession. Those opposite have one strategy, which is to do absolutely nothing - to sit on their hands and let the forces of unfettered markets rip and tear their way through working Australians, working families, right across Australia.Those opposite like to engage in their boutique debate about these matters. But any responsible government in any place in the world will now be acting to reduce the impact of this recession on working families and communities everywhere. These are difficult choices. These are hard times. This is the worst global economic recession since the Great Depression three-quarters of a century ago. We have a strategy for the future. Those opposite have an excuse.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, because it goes to the global dimensions of what we are confronting at the moment. For those opposite who are interested in facts, as opposed to fiction or political opportunity, here is one for you: 32 out of the 33 most advanced economies in the world have been forecast by the IMF to contract this year. Secondly, eight out of 10 of Australia's top trading partners are in recession now. This means, for this country, higher unemployment, and higher unemployment in practically every other economy around the world. Take the United States alone, where they have lost some 5½ million jobs since the beginning of 2008. That is what is happening in the world. What is this government's strategy? It is to support jobs, small business and apprentices today by investing in the nation-building infrastructure our country needs for tomorrow. That is our strategy.What have we done in terms of practical effect? In financial markets in Australia we have acted to provide guarantees for the deposits of each and every Australian in their banks, their building societies and their credit unions, in order to underpin confidence in our financial markets. Secondly, we have reinforced those interventions by the work we have done collaboratively through the G20 to assist in stabilising global financial markets.This government has also invested directly in infrastructure measures. Some 70 per cent of this government's economic stimulus in nation-building infrastructure has been invested precisely in those assets which our country needs to build productivity and economic growth in the future - supporting jobs, supporting apprentices, supporting small businesses across our country. This is nation building for recovery: investing in urban rail; investing in roads; investing in ports; investing in the largest school modernisation program our country has ever seen, to boost productivity; investing in a national broadband network; and investing in skills. We are currently investing in one of the largest expansions in the skills base that this country has ever seen, including investment in some 711,000 new apprenticeships, TAFE places and VET places. Through this we are also implementing much-needed reform because, during this difficult time of economic downturn, for every person under the age of 25 we have a very simple principle: we expect under-25s in this period to be either earning or learning. And we are providing the training places across the nation to turn that principle into reality.Because of the global recession there has been something in excess of a $200 billion collapse in government tax revenues, which means that the government has lost the equivalent of one dollar in every five in tax revenue to the Commonwealth. Two-thirds of this government's temporary deficit is made up from the collapse in taxes caused by the global recession - a temporary deficit supported by the $180 billion debt and deficit plan embraced by the Leader of the Opposition, the Liberals' debt and deficit plan. Two-thirds of this government's temporary deficit is made up from the collapse in tax revenues - one dollar in five -  - brought about by the global recession. The bulk of the remaining one-third in the government's temporary deficit is through the investment in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. This is the question that makes those opposite always squirm when asked to answer: if they are not borrowing against the collapse in tax revenue then which portfolios of government - not 'which programs' - would they cut? Because $200 billion, the equivalent across the forward estimates of something like $50 billion a year, is about equivalent -  - to what we spend at present on the entire health and hospitals budget. So, Leader of the Opposition, if you are going to stand here and pontificate and say that you are not going to borrow to offset against a collapse in tax revenue, name the portfolio, not the program, you are going to abolish. It is either the entire hospitals funding from the Commonwealth to the states, 2½ Defence budgets or more than the entire education spend and a whole lot on top.These are the decisions that we confront in the period ahead. Those opposite always resile from positive news. Did you notice how they disappeared last week when there was, for the month that has just passed, some positive news when it came to unemployment? The Leader of the Opposition disappeared into the abyss; he was not to be seen. The member for North Sydney -  - It appears that the Leader of the Opposition -  - The opposition - the Liberals - hate it every time there is positive news on the economy because they find that it does not suit their political agenda. It might be consistent with where we want to see the national economy go and where every right-thinking person in the country wants to see our economy go, but it does not suit their political agenda. So when the unemployment data came out last week the Leader of the Opposition was nowhere to be seen, but suddenly 'Hockey Joe' appeared and reluctantly took the microphone.There was positive news also in terms of retail sales, which I referred to before, and housing finance commitments are up. The ABS reported today that the number of owner-occupied housing finance commitments rose by a solid 4.9 per cent in March. That is ABS data that is out today. The number of owner-occupied loans is three per cent higher than it was a year ago. This is the first time that there has been positive through-the-year growth since January 2008. First home buyer activity continued to grow with the proportion of owner-occupied loans for first home buyers increasing to 27.3 per cent, the highest since records began. To quote Westpac, households are responding 'to extremely low interest rates and generous incentives for first home buyers'. UBS economist Scott Haslem said: Overall, today's housing lending data is unequivocally strong.Similarly, a report again today from the business confidence survey stated that the situation remained unchanged in April.These elements go towards underpinning one core proposition: a government committed to reducing the impact of the global recession on Australia. If you take a concerted series of measures it will have an effect. Our overall strategy is plain: we are going to continue to support jobs, apprenticeships and small businesses in this economy by investing in the nation-building infrastructure we need for the future. 
An opposition member - It is just naturally occurring wind. - Our strategy is clear, and that is to support jobs, apprenticeships and small businesses today by investing in the nation-building infrastructure our country needs for tomorrow. That is what we are doing and, in every state of our great nation that I have visited in the last six or seven weeks, during which we have not been in this place, the response on the ground has been from communities saying: 'We are glad to see school construction being commenced here. We are glad to see this local government project commencing there. We are even glad to see a sports project commencing in the electorate of Wentworth.' The local member, it seems, having voted against funding for infrastructure projects, then has the gall to show up and say 'me too' in support of that particular project.Wherever you go across the country people are saying: 'At least we have a government in there having a go, supporting local projects, making a difference on the ground, supporting skills in their communities and supporting the construction of new homes, as opposed to an opposition that pretends it has an alternative strategy when in fact its alternative strategy is politics, politics and politics.'</DOC>

 - There is one particular pre-election commitment I am particularly attached to which says: 'There will never, ever, ever be a GST.' That is what those opposite pinned their pre-1996 election commitments on, together with a whole list of others in the period since then. The Leader of the Opposition frankly is grasping at straws when he contemplates his own history and that of his own party on this extraordinary fact. Look at the breaches of commitment undertaken by those opposite on something as core as: 'Are you going to have Work Choices or not? Are you going to have a consumption tax or not?' These are the fundamental breaches in which you engaged and for which you stand condemned.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lyons for his question, because I have spent time in most other states of the country, including Tasmania, in recent weeks addressing local jobs forums. I have been in Perth, Adelaide, the suburbs of Melbourne and south-western Sydney for the last part of last week and I was in Wollongong yesterday.I must admit that I did not notice that the Leader of the Opposition was in that part of Western Sydney where I was last week, but I take his word for it that he was there - presumably having been recently issued with a visa to visit Western Sydney and given a Gregory's in terms of how to get there!On the question of local jobs and their impact across the economy, the government is embracing a strategy which is based on global action through the G20 - The member for Warringah then left the chamber. - As I have gone from one local jobs forum to another, talking to local communities, I have found that what they are concerned about overall is: will government assist local communities which have the highest peaks in unemployment occurring as a consequence of the global recession? They are interested in what we can do to make a difference within local communities. They are interested in what will be delivered in those local communities from our $800 million community infrastructure fund - a series of projects recently announced by the ministers for infrastructure and small business. Those communities were interested to know what we can do to make a difference locally.What we have done in each of those communities is to conduct a forum - with representatives of local business, the local community and charitable sectors, and representatives of local government - with one objective in mind, which is: how can we make a difference to bring down the unemployment rate in those individual localities? This will be a difficult and practical challenge on the ground. But those opposite will simply carp, criticise and be negative, as has been their custom over the last six months, opposing everything and proposing nothing. We, instead, are rolling up our sleeves and getting out there in local communities to try and make a difference.That is why we have established a local jobs fund. That is why we have the Minister for Employment Participation out there, with priority employment coordinators in each of these communities, working through one proposal after another. What will work in south-western Sydney by way of local government projects to provide additional jobs and training opportunities and apprenticeships for those in those communities? How does that differ from those in north-western Tasmania? What do we need to do in the north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide? What can we do in order to make a material difference on the ground? That is what this government's compact with local communities is about - trying to make a difference and anchoring off the back of what we are doing by way of our national economic stimulus strategy to make a further difference on the ground.And when I have been out in those communities the response from people on the ground about the impact of the government's skill modernisation program has been extraordinarily positive. I ran into a builder in south-western Sydney last week who is out there tendering for a range of projects with the Catholic diocese, I think, of the Central Coast. Whether he succeeds or not will be up to the tendering processes but he is confident in what is going on out there. He is putting on an additional two apprentices. He is out there investing in a bobcat to take advantage of the temporary investment allowance which this government has introduced off the back of the recommendations from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He is out there also making use of that by investing in various motor vehicles he needs to run his own small business. And, as I spoke to his staff - about 10 of them - that morning, they also indicated to me that two of them had recently gone out and bought their first homes using the trebling of the first home owners boost.Uncomfortable as it may be, these are the activities happening on the ground and in communities right across Australia for one reason: the government has decided to act, and act decisively - and to do so in a responsible way, per medium of temporary deficit and temporary borrowing, in order to make a difference in the economy, as every economy and every responsible government in the world is doing. Those opposite have embraced a $180 billion debt and deficit strategy. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said recently on Meet the Press; but at the same time he pretends that in fact he is not going to head in that direction.Our strategy is clear: global action through the G20; national action to stabilise our financial markets; national action to invest in short-term, medium-term and long-term infrastructure and stimulus; as well as acting on the ground with each community through a local jobs fund to make a difference. That is a positive strategy for the future. I would commend it to those opposite and that they come along.I saw the member for Macarthur at one of our forums recently in south-western Sydney. Well, good on him! He is out there at least contributing to the discussion about what we can do, practically, on the ground. All those opposite should get out of negative mode and get into positive mode about what we can do for the country. -  - What was the response to that invocation? Another howl of negativity. The expectation of the nation is that this parliament will rise to the occasion and actually make a difference on the ground for communities who are being hit between the eyes by a global economic recession for which they are not responsible. This government has a clear-cut strategy: we are going to support jobs, apprenticeships, small businesses and traineeships by investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow by taking these actions today. That is our approach. That is the right strategy for Australia. I encourage those opposite to abandon their carping negativity and get with the project for the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know she is working closely with local school principals in her electorate on delivering Building the Education Revolution. It is my pleasure to be able to report to the House that our $14.7 billion program to build the education revolution is rolling and supporting schools right around the nation. This is urgent fiscal stimulus to support jobs right around the nation. It is supporting jobs today while we build the infrastructure of the future. There is nothing more important to the future of this nation, to its economic future and to future jobs than the quality of education. - I can see that the member for Goldstein is yelling out in a sarcastic tone that, apparently, to him, school halls are not important at all. I suggest that he walk down to one of his local schools and find out. To date, the Building the Education Revolution program has funded over 10,500 infrastructure projects in 6,491 schools, valued at over $3.7 billion. Under round 1 of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, which I announced last week, it is funding construction and works in 1,499 Australian schools that were successful in having 2,010 projects approved, totalling $2.83 billion. Under round 1 of our National School Pride Program, 5,995 Australian schools were successful in having 8,663 projects approved, totalling $828 million.This is a historic injection of funds in supporting jobs today and in supporting the education infrastructure of tomorrow. Of course, it has been well received by people who care about education right around the country. I quote from a letter to me from Tim Richards, the Headmaster of the Scots School in Bathurst, represented in this place by the member for Macquarie:Work started today on replacing the old worn out asbestos roof on a classroom block. This will benefit our school community greatly as there has been some concern about this roof for a number of years.I also quote the principal of St Augustine's Primary School in Rivervale in Western Australia, in the federal electorate of Swan. He wrote to me about the National School Pride Program and said:_ a refreshed classroom environment and upgrading of facilities in the outdoor areas of the school can only benefit students and their learning. On behalf of St Augustine's School Board, all students and their families, I wish to thank all involved in this initiative. There is no question it will stimulate jobs throughout Australia and in our local communities.I quote from Kaye Lewis, a state school principal in the electorate of New England - probably known to the member there, who I am sure would know all of his principals. Kaye was quoted in the Northern Daily Leader as saying:It's just terrific  - the community has been waiting 20 years for a school hall and we couldn't raise the money. In the past we had to call off events because of wet weather.I draw the attention of the House to the words of Royce Fairbrother, from Fairbrother Constructions in Tasmania, in the federal electorate of Braddon. He said in the Burnie Advocate:I think they - the tenders - are very welcome and very timely particularly in the north and north west. This will be of great benefit to the building industry.This is a measure about supporting jobs today and the educational infrastructure of tomorrow. Members of the government and Independent members of this parliament are working with school principals and those who care about education to deliver Building the Education Revolution.I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, when it comes to the opposition benches, there is no limit to opportunism. After having come into this parliament and voted against Building the Education Revolution, and after having made deriding remarks about the importance of education spending and spending on education capital, I have received 11 letters from members of the opposition asking for money for their local schools. There is no limit to opportunism. - I have received letters from members opposite, including the member for Sturt who is calling out now, asking about their involvement. The member for Sturt is yelling out, 'Why shouldn't we get our share?' I can assure him that schools in his electorate will benefit despite his opposition to the program. - Despite the fact that he did not want the schools in his electorate to get a dollar, they will benefit through this program. The Labor government, the Rudd government, is delivering for all schools. It is members like the member for Sturt who do not want schools in his own electorate or anywhere around the country to benefit from this $14.7 billion initiative. And, of course, apart from the correspondents wanting money from a package they did not vote for, members of the opposition have shown their opportunism by writing to me with various demands about being involved in ceremonies to celebrate these new developments. I assure members of the opposition that I hope they are there answering the question to school communities of why they voted against and why they do not want their local schools to benefit from these programs. I hope they look into the eyes of the local tradespeople who built those construction facilities and say to them, 'I didn't want you to have a job either.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question - of course, a member who is opposed to this expenditure on schools in his community. If the member chooses to check the guidelines of the program he is opposed to, because of course he is opposed to this money going to schools in his community and in South Australia generally, he will find that it is not the federal government that makes decisions about when schools close. Those decisions are made by school systems - made by state school systems, made by the Catholic school system and made by independent schools.We have said to schools around the country that we want to work with them and benefit them. We have also said to our state and territory colleagues and to the block grant authorities in the Catholic and independent school sectors that we want to see this money spent on schools that are going to be there in the future, and we are working with those block grant authorities and state and territory governments on precisely that question.If the member had at any point chosen to look at the material on the website, he would have been aware of that. He could have answered his own question. But, of course, he wanted to come into this parliament and try and cast a slur on this program, because he knows, like every member of the opposition, that school communities around the nation want this expenditure, that tradespeople around the nation want this work. Each and every day of the adjournment from this parliament they have been there, twisting and turning in their own electorates, unable to explain to school principals -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I will remember to ask the member for O'Connor to appear with me at literacy week functions, given his well-thumbed standing orders! I think that is an example to all of us. But my simple point is this: the member opposite has been asked by the tactics committee to try and cast a slur over this program, because members of the opposition - and I can see it written on the faces of the marginal seat members there - cannot explain in their local communities why the opposition is opposed to this measure to modernise schools and is opposed to this measure to support jobs. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to swing around and look into the eyes of the marginal seat members on his back bench, he will see it written all over their faces.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. Indeed, 70 per cent of the Rudd government's economic stimulus package was about infrastructure - infrastructure which is about putting people to work today to build the infrastructure that Australia will need tomorrow. Rail is just one example. There are 17 rail projects fast-tracked, with $1.2 billion of funding going to the Australian Rail Track Corporation, supplemented by $400 million of the ARTC's own money, which has led to major employment around the country, and nowhere less than in the Hunter. A $1 billion upgrade of the Hunter freight rail network is supporting some 650 jobs. So 650 people will be put to work as a result of this program.We announced it last December in the nation-building stimulus package and already I can report that the $11 million Bylong passing loop has been completed. It was announced in December, people were put to work in the months since and it has now been opened. It is open for business, increasing the productivity of the nation. There are jobs now, infrastructure for the future. But it is not just in the Hunter, of course. The upgrade of the line between Maroona and the South Australian border is underway. There is a $45 million upgrade of the line in Victoria between Albury and Seymour underway. These two projects alone created 240 jobs - jobs today, infrastructure for the future. All up, we are investing more in rail in 18 months than those opposite did in 12 long years.Our extra investment in rail is having flow-on benefits. There are 200 people employed at factories making concrete sleepers in Geelong, in Victoria; in Grafton, Wagga Wagga and Mittagong, in New South Wales; and in Beamer, in Western Australia. These are jobs in regional Australia as a direct consequence of the government's nation-building and economic stimulus plans - jobs now, infrastructure for the future. Also in roads, 14 road projects have been accelerated as a result of the economic stimulus packages. Work is underway right now. The Brighton bypass in Tasmania is under construction. It is the largest ever transport infrastructure project in Tasmania's history, with 380 construction jobs. In South Australia there is the Northern Expressway. It is South Australia's largest ever transport infrastructure project, with 350 construction jobs. Work is underway. The Western Ring Road in Melbourne is under construction, with up to 350 construction jobs. There are boom gates for rail crossings. There is a safety proposal targeting 282 high-risk level crossings. We did it as part of the $42 billion plan that we supported and those opposite opposed. Eight of them are completed already. The package was passed by us. Jobs on the ground have been created as a result of this government's plan.Contrast that with the opportunism opposite. We saw opportunism on display yet again in the last question from the opposition, which tried to attack the government's economic stimulus plans. The seat of Barker benefited yesterday from the $5 million contributed through the Community Infrastructure Program announced by my colleague the parliamentary secretary and member for Maribyrnong. - An absolutely extraordinary position was put on the record by the member for Barker - that is, he is opposed to the $5 million injection which will build a library for Mount Gambier, build a new town centre for Mount Gambier and reconstruct the centre of the important regional community in his electorate. He voted against it and he is still against it. The mayor of that community is very supportive. He is not a Labor mayor but the state Liberal candidate for the area. He put in for the project. We supported it because we supported projects right across the country, regardless of the political affiliation of the councils putting forward those projects. The federal member has shown just how isolated he is from his own community, just as he is isolated on the schools program. But the chickens will come home to roost when we come to the next election, because they will be on the record as opposing all these nation-building and job-creating programs in their electorates.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. I would draw the honourable member's attention to the fact, as I did earlier in question time today, that the government has suffered a $200 billion-plus revenue write-down. I would draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that that is an amount equivalent to some $50 billion a year out to the forward estimates, which is an amount equivalent to, for example, abolishing all Commonwealth payments to the states for hospitals and health. Those opposite may seek to pretend that they could stop a revenue write-down. Is that the proposition from those opposite? I do not hear it. If you have suddenly copped the single biggest revenue write-down in this country's financial history, you are required to embrace a series of tough measures for the future in order to ensure that our budget in the long term is financially sustainable. That is what we are doing. It involves hard decisions. These decisions will be dealt with in detail by the Treasurer in the budget this evening.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Canberra, who is a phenomenally well-respected and well-connected local member. The government took early and decisive action to respond to the global financial crisis and to support jobs in the Australian economy. Housing and construction, of course, are major employers, accounting for almost one million jobs around the country. That is why they featured so strongly in both the first and the second stimulus packages. In the first stimulus package, we had the phenomenally successful first home owner boost, which was very opportunistically initially bagged by the opposition and then supported by the opposition. First it was not going to make a difference and then it was not big enough. In the second stimulus package, we committed to $6.4 billion of new spending in social housing. Of that, $400 million has been set aside for repairs and maintenance of public and community housing right across Australia. With that money we will repair around 47,000 homes around the country, with around 10,000 of those homes having major repairs done. Those 10,000 homes have or would have become uninhabitable without this work. At last count we had completed work on over 1,000 dwellings - that is, 1,336 dwellings have had repairs completed.I am also very pleased to announce that in the first stage of new building, where we have set aside $692 million, work has begun on 159 homes, with many more projects due to start in May. That means - and I have seen with my own eyes - slabs laid, brickwork started, plumbers, electricians, bricklayers, builders and carpenters onsite and cement laying. This work is happening right around Australia, as we speak.Two weeks ago I was fortunate enough to visit the first home in Canberra to have had a complete renovation, in Narrabundah, in the member's own seat. This 52-year-old house was vacant and in very poor condition. Without the funding to refurbish this house, it would have been lost to public housing stock. The work on the house was completed in just 16 days by a local company that employed 19 tradespeople onsite to do the work. The renovation included a kitchen refurbishment, a bathroom refurbishment, a laundry refurbishment, internal and external painting, floor coverings and general repairs. The company had six full-time employees and is planning to put on four more full-time employees because of the work that they are doing through this nation-building economic stimulus package. They are also employing another new apprentice. They are putting a new apprentice on because of the extra work that they are getting through the social housing spending. That is a great jobs outcome for Canberra.It is also a great social outcome because the man moving into this house was formerly homeless. He had been living rough on the streets. By moving into this modest home he has got a small second bedroom and he can actually have his kids come and stay with him. He has been separated from his kids for a long time because he has been living rough on the streets. Now he is able to re-establish that connection with his family. So we have got the great jobs outcome and the great social outcome. Nearly 70 per cent of the nation-building economic stimulus plan is in infrastructure and those construction projects are now underway. In the social housing area that means jobs for tradies and apprentices. It means jobs for plumbers and electricians and carpenters and bricklayers. It also means great social outcomes.</DOC>

 - In terms of commitments to the Australian people, as the minister responsible for Work Choices in the past, I am sure that he is completely comfortable with the commitment which his party took to the election in 2004 when Work Choices was mysteriously missing from the public vocabulary of the then government as it sought re-election - and the consequences of that are known to all. I also refer to statements which were made by Tony Abbott some time ago, I think in the lead-up to the 2004 election, on medical matters and related things. There was the MedicarePlus safety net, a cast-iron commitment - the rest of that is history. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I said in my answer to the earlier question, the government has suffered a $200 billion-plus revenue write-down. Those opposite may wish to take out a magic wand and wave that away. This government will take responsible decisions to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of budget discipline. That is why tough decisions have to be made.Furthermore, I would say to those opposite that if they were faintly committed to the prospect of long-term pension reform they would need to embrace one clear concept: how is that sustainable into the future as well? If you are going to look after those people who need the greatest support from the community, the most vulnerable including single age pensioners, if you are going to embrace long-term reform to provide proper certainty and proper support for such people in the future, you have got to maintain long-term financial sustainability as well. This government does not shirk from making tough decisions in the budget, which the Treasurer will announce tonight. We are doing so in the context of a global economic recession, a $200 billion write-down of government revenue, the single largest revenue write-down in this country's financial history. That is what we are wrestling with. Those opposite are content with one thing: playing opposition politics day in and day out.</DOC>

 - I do thank the honourable member for Lowe and I congratulate him for the continued interest that he takes in the importance of trade to Australia's future. I have just returned from China, my fifth visit in the space of 18 months. The Chinese economy is the fastest-growing economy in the world. It will be that for this year, next year and, I suspect, the year after that. China's recovery is well underway, partly due to an $800 billion stimulus package which is focused on both infrastructure and consumption. This not just is important for our resources sector, as important as that is, but also provides exciting new opportunities for our economy in the areas of green building activity, automotive, agribusiness, financial services and education services.There is now a growing view amongst analysts that China's growth will exceed the forecasts. And if anyone wants any evidence of this, in the first quarter of this year compared with last year, China's car sales were up six per cent and retail sales were up 16 per cent - that is on the consumption side - and fixed asset investment was, overall, up 29 per cent and infrastructure was up 100 per cent. This is truly a powerhouse economy reactivating itself. In the midst of this global recession, Australian exports to China increased 48 per cent in the 12 months to March. China helped propel our second highest trade surplus, $2.5 billion according to the figures released last week, now the eighth in a row, despite the global financial crisis. This surplus represents a remarkable achievement in the midst of the global recession and one with which few other economies can compare. For that, China has been a major contributor.Our approach in terms of developing the opportunities further is a two-track approach. One is, of course, to try to conclude the free trade agreement at the national level and, secondly, to go to regional parts of China, all of them diverse and all of them growing at different rates, to develop relationships on a region-by-region basis in terms of commercial activities. I believe also that, if this is done properly, the second track can energise and put upward pressure on the first track.That is the positive opportunity that we have to exploit. What we do not want is the reckless opportunism that has been demonstrated by the other side of this chamber. Quite frankly, China is the place to be. Australia has to get a greater part of the action and we have to tap into the economic growth prospects because this means increased economic growth, increased jobs and increased exports. Our relationship with China and its interdependency is fundamental to our economic future. We have to build on it, we have to strengthen it, we have to deepen it, but we should never fear it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. He is a member in this place whom I have great respect for. However, I say to the member for Kooyong that the question he has just put is actually constructed on a false premise. Firstly, the undertaking I gave the Australian people, as those opposite will be familiar with, was as follows: if there was not substantial and serious commitment to health reform and hospitals reform on the part of the states and territories, the government would then proceed to seek a reference from the Australian people with a view to taking over hospitals from the states and territories. Secondly, since the election, as the honourable member will know full well, we have commissioned the Bennett commission of inquiry -  -  - Oh! Those opposite say 'inquiries'. Did I hear of inquiries launched recently in the matter of climate change - one inquiry, two inquiries, three inquiries; I think we are up to six now, aren't we? Yes, six inquiries. Any inquiry will suit those opposite rather than take a position on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It just folds one into the other in this pathetic excuse for leadership, which is waiting for the member for Higgins to move down from the back bench to the front or for the member for North Sydney or, I understand, perhaps for the member for Bradfield's replacement in Bradfield, who is about to make his way into this chamber. It will be an interesting four-ringed circus once that occurs. Arthur Sinodinos is apparently on his way to Canberra.The commitment we gave to the Australian people was that we would commission, through a National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, an investigation as to the best model for reform for the future. - I apologise to the member for Dickson for not including him in the list of leadership candidates for the Liberal Party. - We will now formally review the member for Dickson's candidature in the leadership contest for those opposite. The commitment we made was to establish the Bennett commission of inquiry, which is a Health and Hospitals Reform Commission inquiry. It has a wide mandate. It is due to report to the government, I believe, around midyear. It will contain a range of options for the government to consider. We will be responding to those as well. - Before the member for Sturt interjects about inquiries and investigations, I would reflect on the appalling substitute for policy action which constitutes the approach of those opposite to climate change right now - refusing to take a position on climate change. The member for Flinders pretends to have a position; the member for Goldstein has the reverse position. - The government's commissioning of Ms Bennett to conclude this inquiry will have its end point when it reports around midyear. It will examine a range of options for the future of our health and hospital system. Those opposite would also be familiar with this, having themselves sucked out $1 billion in federal investment into the public hospital systems of Australia. The government, through the last Council of Australian Governments meeting, returned that investment into the hospital system and agreed on a wide-ranging set of health and hospital reforms with the states and territories. That is practical action for the future.We will consider the Bennett commission of inquiry's report when it is deliberated on and concluded, and we will take what necessary action there is for the future. That is a proper course of action on the part of the government, as opposed to those opposite, who saw hospitals as one single opportunity in the past: a political opportunity simply to kick the states at every single pass and to make themselves look like the big, responsible people in Canberra - disinterested in what was happening in the states, disinterested in the crowding in our emergency departments and disinterested in the lengthening lists of procedures which were necessary in hospitals for people who had a range of complaints and medical conditions. Instead, we have engaged in practical cooperative arrangements with the states. We will act on the Bennett commission's report when it is properly submitted to government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. - I had the good fortune to attend a number of jobs forums in Sydney's west. The member for Banks is one of a number of members on this side who know how difficult things will get in their communities with regard to jobs. I do appreciate him being there and talking to me about what we can do at a local level to assist those communities in the area of employment and training.This government understands that job losses can be very devastating for workers and their families. We understand that it is a difficult thing to confront and overcome in many instances. I say to you, Mr Speaker, to the chamber and to the community via this chamber that this government will continue to do whatever it can to assist workers. On 24 February the Prime Minister announced a $300 million initiative package to help retrenched workers by providing immediate and personalised access to services for those workers in need. That followed the $145 million initiative, the out-of-a-trade apprenticeship initiative, that will provide opportunities and incentives for employers and group training companies to employ apprentices that find themselves out of work or laid off by employers in very difficult times. There is also a further package of assistance for those young people who want to get into apprenticeships but need pre-apprenticeship training and support. That is a $30 million initiative that has been put forward by the government so that we can provide support for those young people.In his earlier answer to a question, the Prime Minister remarked that this government will, of course, implement a $650 million Jobs Fund. That is available to local communities across Australia to provide opportunities for them to create jobs, to build on skills and to develop the sustainable social infrastructure needed for those communities. Already we are hearing some magnificent ideas from small businesses, not-for-profit organisations and others about how we can assist those local communities to do well in what are, of course, very difficult economic times. The new Jobs Services Australia will commence on 1 July this year. These services are indeed -  - I am still, of course, waiting for one question from the member for Boothby in this entire parliamentary term. One day you may get to ask a question, and I am waiting for it.In answer to the question from the member for Banks, we are not only providing new services as the result of extensive and broad consultations with employment providers, employers, not-for-profit organisations, training providers and others; we are also ensuring that those services are more effective in assisting workers to link up to training and training providers and to ensure that there is an integrated approach. For example, when a job seeker needs services in this country, that job seeker can go through one door and access the services that he or she needs, rather than go through four or five separate doors. This integration, this one-stop approach, will be more effective for those job seekers, and for employers in this country who are looking for skills now and when the economy recovers.We know these services are a reflection of the consultations and we know that they will commence from 1 July. They will be working in tandem with the massive training agenda of this government. There are 711,000 training places that will be rolled out by this government. Ninety thousand have already been rolled out and undertaken by people across the country; 319,000 of these are dedicated to out-of-work Australians, many of whom have lost work through no fault of their own. We need to ensure they are given every opportunity to equip themselves with the skills that are needed now and, of course, which will be needed when the economy recovers. We will continue to respond as we have done with the nation-building infrastructure initiatives and with these packages to provide support for out-of-work Australians, ensuring that they have the opportunity to either find work as quickly as possible or find the training that will equip them with skills so they can fill existing vacancies or future vacancies when the economy recovers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for that long and detailed question. In doing so, I understand that he appreciates the significance of the mining and resource sector in Australia. I know how hard we as a government have worked in recent times not only on our government economic stimulus packages but also on bringing in key private sector projects in Australia such as the Gorgon and Browse LNG projects, because those projects create key opportunities for private sector investment in Australia of major significance to all of Australia.In that context, I am more than willing to sit down with the member to consider the serious issues that he has raised this afternoon. In doing so, I will also appropriately consult with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts because some of the issues potentially go to the operation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. I simply say, from the Australian government's point of view, that we are absolutely committed to the development of the resources and energy sector in Australia but in a sense that guarantees appropriate attention to serious environmental considerations. I thank the member for raising this very serious issue in the parliament for our consideration.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. This is a very serious development in an important prevention program, the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. As people in the House would be aware, this is a program that was commenced by the previous government. It was expanded upon and further invested in by our government. Fifty-year-olds, 55-year-olds and 65-year-olds are sent screening tests. My department has identified a problem with the kits that have been sent to nearly half a million people since 1 December last year. There is a problem with the kit that has been supplied under contract to the department - and I would like to thank those alert officers in the department who noticed a very worrying changing trend which caused them to further investigate if there had been any changes to the production of this kit. Of the 475,000 people who have received kits since 1 December, 108,000 have undertaken a test. It turns out that there is some risk that some of those who have undertaken the test will not have been given an accurate response.My department, with the assistance of Medicare Australia, is writing to every person who has received a kit. We will have to not only recall those kits but send new ones. I hasten to add that, for anyone who has had a positive test, it will be accurate. Therefore, they need to get immediate assistance and treatment as they would have been advised. If you have had a negative response, unfortunately that may not be accurate and a test will need to be undertaken again.It is a very serious development. The department is in urgent discussions with suppliers and manufacturers of the kits. Obviously the government will do all it can to ensure that taxpayers' interests are protected. However, our first and foremost consideration will be to ensure that people are able to undertake a proper test that is assured of being accurate. The public confidence in this test, which has already successfully saved millions of lives, is vital, and I would ask for the support of all members of this House in making this information available to anyone who might inquire at their office. There is a number to contact the department, and we will make sure that people receive direct notification within the course of, hopefully, the next week. I am advised that the outer time frame will be two weeks and then the new kits will be able to be provided to people immediately when tests that are of an appropriate quality can be obtained.I thank the House. I think everyone would agree that this is an important measure. It is important that we encourage people to undergo these tests and it is important for them to be reassured that, by the good work of our officers, the problem has been identified relatively early and we will be able to do all we can to rectify it quickly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I made a statement on this matter yesterday, which the member would have seen. It is particularly important for me to confirm to the House that no stop-work order has been issued by the department. The reports that are going around about the closing down of forestry activities are not accurate. Like everybody in this House, I am very keen to see a good outcome for both local jobs and the environment. I have spoken to Minister Macdonald from the state government on this matter. I have asked officials to intensify their negotiations to get this issue resolved. The fact is, and those opposite would know this, that there is national environment legislation that potentially applies to some of these activities. It is called the EPBC Act. It was your legislation and we supported it. I can only presume that it ought to be complied with.We take jobs very seriously on this side of the House - very seriously. The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and others have been standing here at the dispatch box today pointing out with crystal clarity that this government recognises how important employment is. I am very mindful of the need for officials to negotiate an outcome that ensures that employment issues and environment issues are properly and appropriately considered.Let me make one final point on this: all the opposition seem to be able to do is pick things out of the air and run a negative line on them. In doing that, they have a negative narrative running through public debate. On this side of the House, we have a commitment to employment, a commitment to jobs and a commitment to ensuring that there is an appropriate balance between environmental protection and local jobs. We will work to that end.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question and I acknowledge her interest in this matter and the interest of all members of the House in ensuring that we properly commemorate the loss of more than 102,000 lives over the last century in conflicts right back through to World War I and even before that. Reports we have from across the nation with respect to Anzac Day commemorations on this occasion are that we reached record numbers in many places. It is fair to say that some of the inclement weather conditions produced a situation in which that was difficult.Internationally, ceremonies occurred as usual at Gallipoli, where the Minister for Foreign Affairs represented the government. The crowd was down a degree, but that was expected due to the impact of the global financial crisis. But it was still a significant crowd and a crowd which augurs well for the lead-up to the centenary. Commemorations occurred at places like Sandakan and Hellfire Pass. I had the privilege of representing the government at Villers-Bretonneux at the second dawn service there, which followed on from the 90th anniversary last year. Again, the crowd was down slightly, but all concerned were very pleased that the numbers held up well. There was certainly evidence of increased interest from the local French and also from people coming across from the UK. It certainly augurs well for the future growth in the significance of that particular service.I also had the privilege while I was in France to make an announcement with respect to this government's proposal around the question of an interpretative trail, an opportunity to properly educate not only Australians who travel to France but also the British and European community about the amazing efforts of the 1st AIF in the war that was supposed to end all wars. There are a number of locations which relate to this particular proposal. The intention is to try and ensure that if anyone travels there they will have the chance to see what Australians did at various points in time and at the Front, such as in the tragedies of 1916 and 1917 but also in the triumphs that occurred at places like Hamel, Villers-Bretonneux and Mont St Quentin outside Peronne.The locations have been selected in consultation with the local French communities. There are opportunities that we think are available with respect to building on what is already occurring in some locations. We are trying to work with the local French communities to see how we can build a proper commemoration to the work of our diggers so long ago. These locations include Fromelles, where the worst 24 hours in Australian military history occurred, with over 5,500 casualties. The recent discovery of a mass grave at Pheasant Wood provides us with an opportunity to work with the local community to provide a proper interpretation and commemorative location for what occurred on that terrible day. Then there is Pozieres, about which CEW Bean wrote 'a ridge more densely sown with Australian sacrifice than any other spot on earth' - some 23,000 casualties on roughly a mile of front.Then there is Villers-Bretonneux, a location proposed by the previous government. There is an intention to continue with that proposal in conjunction with the local school. That has the support of the French community of the local area. We believe that there can be a significant interpretative capacity there in line with what was intended in the major proposal that was considered for near the memorial.One that will be particularly interesting if it is able to be done will be at Mont St Quentin just outside Peronne. Many Australians are not aware of the significance of the Battle of Mont St Quentin. It was described by Brigadier General Grogan VC as 'perhaps the greatest individual feat of the war - the successful counter-attack by night across unknown and difficult ground, at a few hours notice, by the Australian soldiers'. To anyone who manages to get to Peronne, I urge them to view that location. We are currently in negotiations through the historical museum there with a number of local interests to see what we can do.We have had good indications of support at the local, regional and national level from the French government in terms of their willingness to come to the party around the question of management and also financing with respect to these proposals. We retain a good deal of flexibility, but the intention is to make sure that, in the lead-up to the centenary of the Great War, those Australians who make what is a significant pilgrimage and also those from other countries who go to view that carnage that occurred so long ago see what the Australians did as part of an horrific and tragic - but, in the end, triumphant - effort by those forces who fought.</DOC>

 - I would say to the honourable member for Indi what I have said to other honourable members who have asked questions in the parliament today, and that is that the government is dealing with the reality of a more than $200 billion reduction in its revenues. Firstly, I would draw the attention of honourable members opposite to this fact: when those opposite were in government, in the lead-up to the last election, the last period they were in office, off the back of the mining boom they had something like a $334 billion revenue windfall. In our first year or so in office we are looking at a $200 billion plus revenue reduction. That is the reality we are contending with; that is the reality you lolled around in. We are going to take hard, tough, necessary decisions to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of our budget. Secondly, we are going to do what we can to support jobs, apprenticeships and small businesses in this virtually unprecedented global economic recession and get on with the business of proper government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member and commend her, and indeed other members in areas affected by the recent Victorian fires, for the quality of their representation. The Commonwealth of course is doing its bit to support the reconstruction and working very closely with the Victorian government. On behalf of the government, could I make special mention and commendation of the work of the Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction, Bill Shorten, who is doing an outstanding job on behalf of the government in that respect.The government is also doing its part in endeavouring to minimise the prospect of these events occurring again - a point made by a number of members speaking in this House. In that respect, the week before last there was a very significant development, and that was the agreement by the Council of Australian Governments to develop a national warning system. The Commonwealth agreed to fund the development to the tune of $15 million. It is a program that will be developed and implemented by the states. It will indeed be a significant development. It will have the capability of sending voice messages to landlines and text messages to mobile phones, and that will be a significant thing. It must be recognised that there are currently limitations in the system. Currently, landlines are obviously at fixed addresses. In terms of mobile phones, they will only, with present technologies, be capable of going to billing addresses, which of course may not be where the person holding the phone is located. To further advance those technologies, the Commonwealth and the states agreed to jointly undertake additional research to develop that capability of having geographic or location specific messages. The Commonwealth has agreed to not only fund that but also provide access to the Integrated Public Number Database by providing $11.3 million for those projects.I heard an interjection which I did not take but which was valid, and that was that these measures are not foolproof. There will be areas where there are blackouts and power shortages breaking off phone connections, so these must be seen as an adjunct to other systems of warning. If power is on, obviously there will be warnings provided by television and radio, but sirens, doorknocking and other mechanisms are also being canvassed in the royal commission.This is a very significant development. I really do commend the leadership of the state premiers. They rose above a lot of bureaucratic bickering that had crossed governments for a number of years. They really showed leadership. Finally, I commend and congratulate the Prime Minister on this very significant achievement in the area of disaster management.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon and acknowledge his deep commitment to both jobs and sport. As the parliament would be well aware by now, this government committed $800 million to the biggest ever one-off investment in community infrastructure as part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. As the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government again very articulately pointed out today, we know that this plan is delivering for local communities - it is building local infrastructure and it is supporting local jobs.The good news is that that is not all; there is more that this plan is doing. It is encouraging Australians of all ages to be fit, to be healthy and to be active. I am very pleased to be able to inform the House today that, in addition to delivering much needed support for our economy, this program has provided a historic and a massive injection into Australian community sport. This program has provided almost $300 million for upgrading, redeveloping and building new sports facilities and infrastructure in communities right around Australia, and we on this side of the House know that that is worthy. We know that investment in sporting infrastructure is important in removing a barrier to participation in sport and rec. We want to be a strong supporter of the Australian sports system, all the way from grassroots community sports up to elite sports and the podiums. So across a range of sports right across Australia there will be improved community clubs, enhanced facilities and new infrastructure while supporting Australian jobs.Last week I had the opportunity to see firsthand the impact of some of these projects. I note that I was with the member for Page when we announced $3.4 million to build a brand new aquatic centre in Evans Head. In meeting with some of the local residents - local residents who, I must say, have campaigned for years and years for this project - I noted their delight in knowing that this project would become a reality. I would like to share the comments of just one of the local constituents of the member for Page, Mrs Shirley Dawson. She pulled me aside and said to me: 'I would like you to thank the government for this funding. We know that it is important for the community. But also I like to go swimming, and this means that long into my old age when I can no longer drive I will be able to swim my laps and make sure that I stay active.' This is just one example of how this program is also benefiting health and benefiting the preventative health agenda.I also had the opportunity, along with the member for Wakefield and the Mayor of Salisbury, to announce funding of over $4.4 million for the north-west sector sports ground development. I would like to share with the House the comments of some of the local councillors, who said that at the moment they are quite literally turning away hundreds of young members of the community who want to play soccer but are unable to because of inadequate facilities. This means that these kids can be active and can take part in using the sporting facilities, which we all know is very important.So, while those opposite may choose opportunistically to try and jump into photo ops now despite the fact that they stood in this parliament and voted against these local community initiatives, we know that this program is a massive boost for Australia's grassroots sporting facilities and it is also a great thing for our economy, a great thing for our local communities and a great thing for community sport.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition is correct: the budget deficit will be 4.9 per cent of GDP.Opposition members - What's the figure? - It is the figure that I said on radio this morning, 57.6. Can I say to those opposite the government welcomes a debate on debt and deficit, a debate which those opposite have joined with such vigour and clarity this morning; there has been such a sterling performance on the part of those opposite in having a uniform position on debt and deficit. You see, the position of the Liberals on this question is actually directly relevant to the question just asked by the Leader of the Opposition, because what they do in the Senate directly affects the shape of the deficit. We know from the last budget what happened with the blocking of various measures, both on the expenditure side and on the revenue side. We do not know from any of the statements which have been made so far what will happen in the Senate on this occasion and therefore the extent to which that affects what the government has by way of the final content of its proposed borrowing and deficit. Therefore the position of those opposite is not just of academic interest; it is of direct interest to the bottom line which will be delivered to the public revenue of the Commonwealth of Australia.But there we were this morning - can you just picture it? - with those opposite signalling loud and clear: 'We're about to have a fusillade on debt and deficit today.' You are over there in Fort Turnbull in the bunker and you are working out what is going to happen on this day, the first day after the budget. You are going to have a complete blitzkrieg on debt and deficit. So the whistle blows at 0700 and out you go and over the top and you have the field commander out there, the Leader of the Opposition, and the regimental sergeant-major, the member for North Sydney. Out they have gone ready to whack as one and at 0800 the shrapnel starts to fly. What happens then? The regimental sergeant-major is on Channel 7 and is asked a very direct question and that question is along these lines, so this is what Joe was asked: 'How much debt would you support and how big a deficit would you support?' The answer is as follows: 'I'll give you a figure as a starting point, at least $25 billion smaller.' So thank you, Joe! Joe has given us a definitive number, 25 billion. Well, thank you very much. - They may be equivocating now but it is $25 billion. - So the member for North Sydney is out there delivering with crystal-clear clarity for the first time the position of the opposition on their debt and deficit strategy; that is, the government's minus $25 billion. That is at 0800. At 0816 the regimental field commander himself takes position with the artillery barrage to come and the artillery barrage commences with his time on Sky Television, so Sky actually does an interview with the regimental field commander over there and he is asked the following question about debt and deficit. The Leader of the Opposition says:If we were in government today revenues would be higher.That is an interesting proposition: you get your magic wand out and you say, 'We're going to create more tax.' It is just by waving the magic wand. Let us leave that one to one side for the moment.Revenues would be higher as a product of a direct administrative - 'decree', I presume.spending would be lower, therefore debt would be much lower and the deficit would be much lower. Now the reality is - and here the journalist, David Speers, asks:But you can't say what figure?Then the Leader of the Opposition says:Well, no. You can't because you, because you, I mean you, you could sit down, you could work out a model. But as we see with all of these financial models, you know, each assumption becomes fairly subjective.So that was at 0816. At 0800 this morning the whistle has gone, the shrapnel is flying and the shadow Treasurer says government debt and deficit minus $25 billion. Sixteen minutes it took for the Leader of the Opposition to say, 'I haven't got a clue. I refuse to name a number.' Well, there we have the regimental field commander and the regimental sergeant-major out there in full flight against the government, saying -  -  -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. So there we have the RSM, the member for North Sydney, out there confirming it, using his gross debt figure this morning - $300 billion minus $25 billion, so $275 billion - with absolute clarity and, 16 minutes later, the Leader of the Opposition saying, 'Oh, no, I couldn't possibly confirm a number.' But the supreme irony is this: they chose the terrain of battle. This is what they wanted to fight us on today and, 16 minutes into the fray, you have got over there Captain Confusion and Colonel Chaos, who could not agree on a single number in terms of their assault on the government.In this entire debate on net debt and on deficit and on borrowing, there are some very basic questions for the Leader of the Opposition to answer when it comes to his budget reply tomorrow night. Question No. 1: will the Leader of the Opposition confirm what the member for North Sydney has said and therefore borrow in order to meet the $210 billion plus collapse in tax revenue? Question No. 2: to what extent would he in addition fund discretionary stimulus and on what projects? Question No. 3: which of the government's spending proposals and investment proposals do they support or reject? Question No. 4: which of the $22 billion worth of savings measures do they accept or reject? Unless these questions are answered, what we have from those opposite is just white noise. It means nothing. It is pure political spin - that is all they are engaged in.Less than 24 hours after the budget, we have seen the single greatest disintegration of an opposition attack on an element of fiscal policy that we have seen in this place for decades. They should be ashamed of themselves. This used to be the once great Liberal Party. It has collapsed in a heap. - Yes, Mr Speaker. - </DOC>

 - I certainly thank the member for Page for her question. The central task of this budget is nation building for recovery - an unprecedented $22 billion of investment in infrastructure, an investment in infrastructure that those opposite could never commit to in their whole 12 long years in office. These investments will bring jobs and they will bring productivity for the long term. They are important investments for the long term, not just in hard infrastructure but also in the best human capital: investment in education. These represent the building blocks for the future.The budget includes $8.5 billion of investment in economic infrastructure. This will mean that when the recovery takes hold our ports will not be straining and our rail networks and roads will not be clogged, and it means we will be much better positioned to take full advantage of the global recovery when it comes. Critically, these investments support jobs now and they will employ thousands of Australians. Nothing could be more important in the current environment than putting in place policies in the short term, the medium term and the long term to support jobs, because these unprecedented investments in nation-building infrastructure are the third phase of our economic stimulus package. The first phase was payments to support jobs; the second phase was the shovel-ready projects that are now taking off right around the country. Thirty-five thousand projects have been launched right around the country and including in Page. This is important investment in schools and social housing that those opposite seem to think does not matter - does not count as infrastructure - but it is a lasting legacy for our communities and it is for support of jobs that those projects are taking place right around the country.Now, of course, we have the commitment to big infrastructure. We have a commitment to a fair go for pensioners. We have the investments in our health and hospital system. We have a historic paid parental leave scheme, something that those opposite could not bring themselves to come to in 12 years of office. And, of course, we have a 50 per cent small business tax break for eligible investments.This is a budget that charts the way back to surplus. It puts in place the necessary savings that are required. Those opposite are talking about deficit all the time, but they cannot nominate one saving they will make. The weight is on them now. There has been a record $210 billion write-down of the revenue over the forward estimates. They say they support pensions. If they support the pensions and the good things that come with the budget, they will have to support the savings that come with it. The weight is on the opposition to nominate where they would make savings - the weight is on them. But, for our part, we will chart a course back to surplus. We will make the long-term savings that they could not make in all their long term in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because it goes to the forecasting methodologies used by the Treasury, which have been the subject of some debate in the last period of time. The first change which is evident in the way the Treasury has presented its forecasts and its projections for the years ahead is to add one extra year - that is important to note. It is to bring it into consistency with international practice. For example, in the United States there are three estimates years and seven projection years. In New Zealand there are five estimates years and 10 projection years. In Sweden there are four estimates years and three projection years. In Australia there are three estimates years and two projection years. That is a change that we have made because it is useful in terms of long-term economic planning and long-term economic forecasting to bring these practices in Australia into conformity with emerging practice abroad. That is the first point.The second point I would make to the Leader of the Opposition goes to the question of the underpinning of the growth forecast in the two outyears of the forward estimates. First, it should be noted by those opposite that the three years of below-trend growth occur in 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 - that is, these are all below-trend growth. The two years above trend are the two years at the outer end of the spectrum - that is, 2011-12 and 2012-13, where, as the Leader of the Opposition has just indicated, real GDP is assumed to grow at 4.5 per cent. However, here is the point I would draw to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition: growth is forecast to remain below trend for three years - that is, longer than during the downturns of the 1980s and the 1990s. In the 1980s you had below-trend growth for a year following that recession; in the 1990s, it was below-trend growth for two years. Here is an assumption on our part that it will in fact be a slow return to above-trend growth. - So on the whole question of where this fits - that is, Treasury's projections for the two outyears of what is now the forward estimates - it is in fact more conservative than the projections by the then Treasury concerning recovery from the two earlier recessions, one in the 1980s and one in the 1990s.There is also an important point to note and it does go to the question that the Leader of the Opposition raised specifically in reference to the IMF and to others who make projections and to the attitude of other commentators on these growth projections. I would draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to comments this morning by the Chief Economist of CommSec, Craig James, by the senior economist of Icap Australia, by UBS and by Westpac in its Australian federal budget report, all of which have described the federal Treasury's forecast in the budget papers as being on the pessimistic or bearish side. That is what they have had to say.Obviously there is going to be debate among forecasters on the question of methodology, but the government believes in the independent advice of the Treasury and I would say to those opposite that they should respect the independence and integrity of the Commonwealth Treasury. The importance of these forecasts goes to how we actually project ahead with growth. - As I said, there are a range of views about the future shape of growth. I have just referred to four market economists who actually believe that those contained within the Treasury forecast are on the bearish side.But, again, the reason that this is relevant is that it goes to the whole question of how we structure our public finance of the future and how we structure debt and deficits into the future and, therefore, the relevance and role of the Liberals in the Senate. I referred before to what was an exercise in policy confusion on the part of those opposite on the question of debt and deficit. That was volume 1. But as they say in the steak knives advertisement, 'There's more,' because later on this morning, at 8.23 am - remember, the charge is on in the question of debt and deficits - we have the Leader of the Opposition on AM on the question of how he would have done this budget differently. - At 8.23 this morning, on AM, what we had from the Leader of the Opposition was as follows:Well, there is no doubt. Look, I don't think there is, it is very hard to imagine a circumstance in which the Budget this year would not be in deficit but it may have been in deficit by a very small amount or it may have been in surplus by a small amount with different policies -  - I know those opposite welcome this because, again, we then had the 'RSM' come in at 10.20 this morning and say, 'Well, a lot of that $200 billion is wiped out projected surpluses and of course the budget would go into deficit.' The Leader of the Opposition said -  -  - It shows the absolute chaos and confusion of those opposite, with the Leader of the Opposition saying that he could produce a budget surplus and the shadow Treasurer saying that there was no hope in hell of producing a budget surplus, and they stand here believing that they have a credible alternative critique to make of this government. They stand as an absolute rabble - utterly leaderless until the member for Higgins moves from his present seat down to that seat.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The government's budget strategy is focused on sustaining jobs and economic activity in the shorter term, investing in nation-building infrastructure and skills for the recovery and for longer-term productivity and jobs, and starting the work of repairing the structure of the budget after the damage that has been done by the huge drop in revenue, courtesy of the global recession.All you have to do is look at the data in the budget to see that the reality of deficits is overwhelmingly driven by that huge drop in revenue. In fact, the total drop in revenue across the four years of forward estimates is slightly higher than the total amount of deficits over that period. So what we are seeing is a huge hit to the budget as a result of that drop in revenue, and it is the government's position that the most appropriate economic strategy in this circumstance is for us to allow deficits to unfold and to borrow to cover those deficits for a period of time. The budget does of course contain a number of very substantial savings measures which are designed to commence the process of returning the budget to a surplus over time. There are very significant changes with respect to health requirements, family tax benefits, pension entitlements and matters of this kind, and that will start the hard work of returning the budget to surplus.The government has already been criticised by the opposition for the allowance of the budget being in deficit for some period of time. Therefore it is worth while scrutinising what the alternative might be, the contractionary alternative. It is, admittedly, difficult to discern precisely what the opposition's position is. Today's examples that the Prime Minister cited are yet another instalment of that. We have seen over the past 12 months many new commitments on the part of the opposition for new spending, we have seen many new promises that they have made to increase the spending hit on the budget, we have seen them blocking the government's savings initiatives in the Senate and we have seen not one single new savings initiative. Yet, at the same time, they claim that they would have lower deficits and less debt. So in other words the proposition from the opposition is that they would spend more, tax less and have lower debt and lower deficits. Only an investment banker could offer you that kind of deal: more spending, less tax, lower deficits and lower debt.In spite of the confusion, we are today finally getting some indication of the true opposition position. I note, as the Prime Minister indicated, that the member for North Sydney stated today that they would run a deficit $25 billion lower than the government's projected deficit. The Leader of the Opposition said on Sky News, 'If we were in government today, revenues would be higher, spending would be lower, therefore debt would be much lower and the deficit would be much lower.' In other words, there would be higher taxes and less spending, although he did not quite say that, but that is what it means.I got a further insight into this this morning debating the shadow minister for finance, competition policy and deregulation, Senator Coonan, at an accountants breakfast. I am sure everybody in this House knows who the shadow minister for finance is. Senator Coonan opened her contribution by quoting approvingly a quote on the evils of debt from none other than Herbert Hoover at the 1936 Republican convention in Nebraska. Herbert Hoover, of course, was the President of the United States from 1928 to 1932 who relentlessly, rigorously, did absolutely nothing in the face of the Great Depression in order to avoid debt and deficit. He did absolutely nothing, while the unemployment mounted, the businesses failed, the misery -  - I was asked about the alternative, contractionary approach to the budget, and of course the high priest of this approach was Herbert Hoover. He put his theories into practice and produced the Great Depression in the United States. It is worth noting that at this particular Republican convention in 1936 even the Republican Party realised that Herbert Hoover was a dud and decided not to renominate him for the presidency. But the Liberal Party is still sticking with his views 70-odd years later. Although, to cut Senator Coonan some slack, I am not quite sure that she knows who she is talking about, because later in the speech she referred to the quote again and called him J Edgar Hoover. Perhaps now the Liberal Party is getting its economics policies from the FBI! - Unfortunately for the member for O'Connor and, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition and the entire opposition, there is a very serious side to this. That is, they are adopting a position that implies massive job losses, massive business failures and huge economic contraction. If you took $25 billion out of the budget now, guess what that would do: it would devastate economic activity in this country. It would trash jobs. It would trash employment. It would trash economic activity. Thousands of businesses would be bankrupt. They are adopting the economic policies of Herbert Hoover that directly led to the Great Depression. That is the serious side that I would urge the member for O'Connor to look very closely at, and I would urge the Leader of the Opposition, who clearly is totally confused about their position, to get with the government's position, which is that deficits are unavoidable in order to sustain jobs and economic activity in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Once again, what we have seen in the debate in the last 24 hours or so is a direct assault on the integrity of the Treasury. This is exactly what they did last year. When they are not attacking the Reserve Bank governor -  - The government takes seriously independent advice it has obtained from the Treasury - the same Treasury which advised the member for Higgins, has advised previous treasurers and, through their treasurers, the Prime Minister of the time as well. That is the first point. The second is: whenever those opposite dislike what is produced by way of projections or data, they attack the originator. Last week, you did so in relation to the ABS data -  - The government relies on the independent advice of the Treasury as it has done in the past, as it will do in the future and as governments of all persuasions have until this most recent opposition has decided to release a series of attacks directed at independent agencies - the Treasury, the Reserve Bank and, most stunningly last week, the Statistician over the unemployment data when the member for Wentworth mysteriously went missing in Western Sydney, as he described yesterday. Well, the member for North Sydney said yesterday -  -  - Whenever the data does not suit those opposite, they attack the agencies which produce it. That is a constant thematic. It has been the approach they have adopted with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank more broadly, and, on the part of the member for North Sydney, in relation to the attack on the independence of the Australian Statistician last week on the unemployment data. On the matter which has just been raised by the member for Curtin, the member for North Sydney indicated last week, when the unemployment data came out, that the Leader of the Opposition would be fronting afterwards for a press conference. He did not.On this matter concerning the Treasury: they provide advice; the government receives that advice; and, accordingly, the government acts and incorporates that advice within the government's budget papers. I would say also to those opposite that, when Senate estimates approaches, there will be ample opportunity to quiz the relevant officials as those opposite have done in the past and, I am sure, will do in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her very important question. Since last year's budget, government revenues have been written down by $210 billion. That is the biggest write-down in government revenues in living memory. It equates to something like the entire Commonwealth health spend over the forward estimates - just a huge, huge contraction in government revenues. And, of course, that contraction in government revenues is responsible for something like two-thirds of the write-down in the budget position. That is the enormity of what has occurred through the global recession. In 2010-11 alone, revenues have been written down by $55 billion. That is why we have said that there are no easy answers in this situation and it is why we take our responsibility very seriously to engage in borrowing for a temporary deficit, because, if we did not do that, taxes would have to rise or services would have to be massively cut.We took this issue very seriously and we put in place in the budget serious long-term structural changes to expenditure, rebalancing sustainable support for private health insurance and ensuring that families on increasingly higher incomes do not receive family payment benefits - a whole list of things which we went through last night, a list where everybody has to do a bit to make up for this huge cut in revenue which has come to national income. So we do take our responsibilities very seriously.As the finance minister was saying before, what is the alternative to not running a temporary deficit? Massive cuts to services or massive increases in taxation. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation was talking about events that occurred in the 1930s. Herbert Hoover responded by doing precisely that - absolutely nothing. And, of course, the sit and wait and see attitude of Herbert Hoover is the attitude of those opposite. In fact, if you want to equate the Leader of the Opposition to somebody in those days, he is the Otto Niemeyer of Australian politics because that was the recommendation - that governments should not stimulate the economy, that governments should raise taxes and that governments should cut back on services. - Sir Otto over there had this to say about what his position would be. The Leader of the Opposition was asked on AM this morning:But just quickly, you would have engaged in some stimulus spending and there would have been a deficit?He replied, 'It may have been in deficit by a small amount or it may have been in surplus by a small amount with different policies.' If he was going to have it in surplus, he is proposing spending cuts in one year alone of $50-odd billion. What a massive hit that would be to the economy, what a massive hit that would be to employment, what a massive hit that would be to businesses in the Australian economy. The sensible thing to do in this environment is to run a temporary deficit. If those opposite were in power, they would have to borrow to meet revenue write-downs. But what we get from Sir Otto over there is this deficit and debt con job, pretending somehow that they would not have to borrow to meet these circumstances. Well they would and it is about time that those opposite nominate where they would make their savings in these circumstances.</DOC>

 - What we have is more voodoo economics from the shadow Treasurer. He wants to pretend there has not been an unwinding of the mining boom. He wants to pretend that there has not been a terms of trade collapse. He wants to pretend that we are not in the midst of a global recession. - Last night we put in place a plan, a nation-building budget for recovery, a budget to support the economy in the face of this global recession and to support jobs and Australian businesses in the most serious global economic event to occur in 75 years. That is the thrust of the budget delivered last night and it is something that this country desperately needs in the circumstances in which we find ourselves internationally. There is a lot of support for what the government has had to say about the need for temporary borrowings. The forecasts are there in the budget for everybody to read. It is going to take some time for growth to come back to trend but growth will come back to trend because recessions do end. When they end, there is a lot of spare capacity and that is when economies begin to grow quickly. This is what Standard and Poor's have had to say about last night's budget, given all the claims we have had from those opposite about deficit and debt. - This is what Standard and Poor's have had to say about the budget:We believe the deficits and associated borrowings do not alter the sound profile of the country's public finances. This is underpinned by the strength of the government's balance sheet _And our return to surplus, our return to paying off debt and our investment in the nation will bring back growth as soon as we possibly can.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. I know that he is concerned, in his constituency, about supporting jobs today and about ensuring that this nation wins the global competition for the jobs of the future. Jobs today and jobs of the future are at the heart of the budget announcements made by the Treasurer last night. This is a budget that delivers support for jobs today whilst building the infrastructure and policies we will need so that Australians can have the skills that they will need to win the global competition for the jobs of the future.At the heart of this budget, of course, is continuing stimulus through capital investment - a $22 billion capital investment program to support jobs today. And much of this investment is directed towards renewing places of learning around the country, because we know how important those places of learning will be to Australians getting the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow. Our capital investment goes to schools, trade training, technical and further education and, as announced last night, a major capital investment into universities and research infrastructure.As the member for Forde said in his question, this budget not only delivers on that kind of support for jobs today but, through stimulus, capital investment and the infrastructure we need for tomorrow, it provides direct support for jobseekers. It particularly provides direct support so that they can gain the skills they need for the work opportunities to come. This budget presents an interlinked set of policies - through our jobs compact with retrenched Australians, with young Australians and with local communities. That is an investment of $1.5 billion. There are interlinked programs to support apprentices and related programs in the order of $5 billion and a $2 billion investment in productivity places. Those are record, huge investments in skills and opportunities for Australians.Some of the highlights of these packages - they are displayed comprehensively in the budget papers - include assistance to unemployed Australians to train, through our training supplement of $41.60 per fortnight; the training and learning bonus; the education entry payment and funding for training in productivity places. The government will provide people on Newstart Allowance and parenting payment who are undertaking a 12-month course, with the equivalent of an additional $43 per week in financial assistance. The government in these packages is also assisting apprentices and their employers to complete their training through the Securing Australian Apprenticeships and Traineeships initiative.But the budget does more. It provides cash payments of $3,800 to apprentices and trainees by redoing existing incentives and making them more efficient. An additional 14,000 apprentices will receive this support. Payments to mid-career apprentices will be extended to 25-to-29 year olds, entitling them to an extra $7,800 in the first year of training and $5,200 in the year after that.This budget, beyond supporting jobs today and delivering assistance to jobseekers through our jobs and training compact, through our productivity places and through our support for apprentices and related matters, also invests in the jobs of the future. There will be nothing more important to Australia gaining its fair share of the jobs of the future than the performance of our higher education system as it leads us into the knowledge economy. That is why the government in this budget delivers a comprehensive response to the Bradley and Cutler reviews, with a $5.7 billion package to transform our higher education system into a system that responds to the needs of students - with places following student demand - and transforms our system. It does that by ensuring that there is money in the system and incentives so that universities partner with schools to create new opportunities for Australians from low-SES backgrounds to go to university. This is a measure to ensure that the sons and daughters of Australians, no matter what household they are born into, have an opportunity to go to Australia's universities - not by reducing standards, but by having our universities and our schools work together to create an educational pathway for those children to deliver on the promise of this nation that every child deserves the best possible start in life.In this budget we have restructured student assistance, student income support, so that it better supports Australian students and particularly targets that assistance to where it is most needed. We have put in this budget a landmark increase in indexation for universities, performance funding that will make a difference to quality and a new national system of quality regulation, and we have delivered major new capital investments. This is a transformation of our university system so that it can lead this nation in the knowledge economy of tomorrow for the jobs of tomorrow whilst we deliver on providing support for Australian jobs today.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, what I can say is what is in Budget Paper No. 1. We do get it down, I think, to about three per cent net debt over that time. We will continue to pay it down from that period, because that is the responsible thing to do. -  - This juvenile behaviour is just extraordinary. It is absolutely juvenile. The estimates are all there; the member has just quoted from them. What I can say is that we are engaging in temporary borrowing to meet the requirements of this economy because of the very sharp contraction that has taken place.Those opposite want to pretend that somehow, if they were in government, they would not be borrowing and they would not be paying down debt, but they will be, and that is the particular game that they are playing today. This government's medium-term fiscal strategy is to pay down debt as quickly as we can. That is what the budget papers say and, as the member opposite knows, it gets down to the minuscule level of three per cent in the year that he mentioned. That is what happens - the minuscule amount compared to what is going on internationally, where comparable advanced economies in countries around the world have levels of net debt at about 80 per cent. So they should stop playing their silly political game and admit that debt is necessary to support jobs and that a medium-term fiscal strategy requires some long-term structural savings. So there is a moment of truth approaching for the shadow Treasurer, because he is going to have to show how he would pay down debt, and so will the Leader of the Opposition tomorrow night.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. This year's budget provides an additional $8.5 billion for nation-building transport infrastructure, bringing our total investment in nation-building infrastructure to $35 billion. This includes the most significant ever investment by the federal government in rail for our major cities - nine out of 15 new projects announced last night. There is support for rail in Perth, in Adelaide, in Melbourne, in Brisbane, on the Gold Coast and in Sydney - right across the nation. There is an engagement in urban rail that will provide cleaner, greener, faster public transport services to those who live in our major cities. It is good policy in dealing with urban congestion but also good policy as part of the fight to tackle dangerous climate change.But we have also delivered for regional Australia. Of the $35 billion, some $21.2 billion, or 60 per cent, will directly benefit those living in regional communities through projects such as the Hunter Expressway in New South Wales. We will be fixing the Cooroy to Curra, section B - ignored by those opposite, even when the transport minister was the local member. There have been 13 fatalities on this section of the road since July 2002. It took a Labor government to fix it, and fix it we will. We will be dealing with ports, dealing with nation-building infrastructure, supporting jobs today but building the infrastructure that the country needs tomorrow. The centrepiece, the largest single infrastructure project, is of course our $43 billion commitment to fibre-to-the-premises broadband. We believe that this is absolutely critical. It is through information technology being available that we are communicating the message of last night's budget to our constituents and to the population in general.I would encourage people to log on to the website, www.economicstimulusplan.gov.au, to see the direct impact that our plan is having right around the nation. But they do not have to just log on to our website, because many members of this House are using information technology to send a message about jobs. There is one member opposite who is sending a big message about a particular job through the internet. People can log on to the new website that has just gone live in conjunction with the budget, www.petercostello.com.au. It went live today, in conjunction with the budget. We have heard about the confusion of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer when it comes to budget initiatives. Well, it is not just our side that agrees it is inadequate. Pete clearly thinks they are not -  - I am, absolutely, because I was asked a question as the Leader of the House by the member for Wills about the way in which members are communicating about the budget with members of the public, and I am doing just that. I can understand why those opposite are sensitive, given the sophistication of this budget site with videos, indeed with information about Higgins. He could not turn up to the community infrastructure program launch I did in Higgins last week, but now he has a new-found interest in his electorate.Of course, the member for Higgins could have been a bit more imaginative when he decided the title, because people might not be able to find this website. Perhaps he could have named it noticker.com.au. Perhaps he could have called it 'Plan C.org'. Perhaps he could call it imavailable.com.au. - Thanks, Mr Speaker. The fact is that those opposite are characterised in their attitude towards this budget by opportunism. They vote against programs, then they go to the launch. They vote against nation-building broadband, but they are quite happy to use the internet to try to launch a challenge against the Leader of the Opposition. -  - Those opposite are characterised by opportunism, which is why they cannot put forward a coherent attack on this nation-building budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. As I said before, we have a very clear strategy that will begin returning the budget to surplus and pay down debt as the economy recovers, and the budget delivers on that strategy. We put in place the structural saves that are absolutely essential over the long term, we have offset new spending by the final year of the forward estimates and we have held real growth in spending to under two per cent in the years the economy is projected to grow above trend, in 2011-12 and 2012-13. And, of course, this strategy is expected to see the budget return to surplus in 2015-16 and reduce the levels of debt to 3.7 per cent of GDP by 2019-20.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question and for his long-time campaigning for the pensioners in his electorate. There are around 30,000 pensioners who will benefit from the decisions the Treasurer announced last night. Yesterday was a historic day for Australia's pensioners. More than three million age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veterans service pensioners will get a pension rise.From 20 September this year, single pensioners on the full rate of the pension will receive a $32.49 increase per week. Pensioner couples will receive a $10.14 increase per week. The increase will bring the single rate of the pension to two-thirds of the rate of couples combined. There will be an increase in the base rate for single pensioners and a new pension supplement for all pensioners to simplify the complex maze of payments. All existing pensioners will receive an increase in their total pension payments.These are the most significant reforms to our pension system for 100 years. These reforms will help to cushion pensioners from the impact of the global economic recession, but they will also deliver a stronger, fairer and now a sustainable pension system into the future. Of course, the reforms have been welcomed widely, both by pensioners and by pensioner groups. I will just quote from a few of them. Michael O'Neill, from National Seniors, says:We think (the pension rise) is a very good outcome. It delivers relief for the most vulnerable - single age pensioners _From the Council on the Ageing, Ian Yates says:After years of unfair treatment for single age pensioners, they have been recognised and large steps have been taken to rectify it. The new pension system is simpler, which is most welcome.And Val French, from Older People Speak Out, says:Recognition and understanding as last, and cheers in lifting the age eventually to 67. Those of us on a pension have greeted the budget with relief.She goes on to say that she congratulates the government on its decision to move towards increasing the pension age to 67. That decision on the pension age has also been welcomed by business. If I can just quote Heather Ridout from the Australian Industry Group, she says:I think it is a very sensible decision and it really addresses those intergenerational problems that are coming down the track.As I said, these are major reforms and they have involved very tough decisions to make sure that the pension is sustainable for the long term.I am pleased to tell the House that we have state governments also getting behind these reforms. Just this morning the South Australian Treasurer - I am sure the member for Port Adelaide will be pleased to hear this - has confirmed that the South Australian government has agreed to the Prime Minister's request that the pension rise flow through to pensioners in public housing so that the pension rise is not gobbled up by rent increases. These reforms are essential. They are long overdue, decisive action to prepare Australia for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. One of the reasons why we have been so serious about savings in this budget is precisely that we understand that we have to move, first of all, to economic stimulus to support the economy, to support jobs and, as the global economy recovers, to step down on our spending and return the economy to surplus - which is why we have put in place these long-term structural savings. That is why, in this budget, we have delivered something like $22.6 billion in savings over the forward estimates, with no new spending in the final year of the forward estimates.We absolutely understand that, on a temporary basis, we have to spend to stimulate the economy; then we have to bring the budget back to surplus as the global growth returns. That is very important, and it has involved hard choices - hard choices the government has not been afraid to make in this budget. Of course, net spending in this budget is $13 billion over the forward estimates - so I do not know what calculations the shadow Treasurer is using - and the great bulk of that is in the first two years, when it is most needed in terms of economic stimulus. Real spending growth has been held to under two per cent in the years the economy is projected to grow above trend. That is what we have done.So do not come in here and continue to fiddle the figures, as you have been doing. Why don't you come in here and be honest about what you would do in these circumstances? Be honest about it and stop playing these silly political games, because we are very serious about supporting our economy, about supporting jobs in this economy and about nation building for the recovery. It is just a pity that we do not have an opposition that has a clue about it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for her question. It is plain to all members of the House and, I think, to all people across the nation listening to this debate today that we have faced an enormous challenge in the preparation of this budget, delivered in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Therefore, the challenge which the government has been seized with is: how do we construct the building blocks, the foundation stones, upon which economic recovery can be constructed? That is why we have embarked upon nation building for recovery. I would encourage all members of the House to get behind this national effort, this national campaign, to build the economy with positive ideas, positive engagement, and take the positive lead of many out there in the business community - out there making hard decisions to support growth and employment in the most difficult of circumstances.Our overall principle is this: to support jobs, small business and apprenticeships today by building the infrastructure our nation needs for tomorrow. That is why we are investing $22 billion through this budget in roads, rail and ports in practically every state in the Commonwealth. That is why we are investing in a national broadband network right across the nation in order to connect our regional centres and our smallest towns with a proper, modern information superhighway for the 21st century. That is why we are investing $3.6 billion in clean energy projects, including a $1.5 billion investment in what will become, we are advised, the nation's and the world's single largest solar power plant. On top of that, we are investing $3.7 billion in education and research, and supporting also superscience projects right cross the university infrastructure of our nation - in nanotechnology, in biotechnology, in the marine sciences and in climate change science, as well as in space science and astronomy.On top of that, we are investing $3.2 billion in health and hospitals, including investment in some of our nation's most important hospitals, those in particular need. Furthermore, we are investing in critical areas of research, including $1.2 billion for an integrated cancer care network across the country, led by great institutions in Sydney - what will become Lifehouse at the RPA, in honour of a person respected by both sides of politics in this place, Dr Chris O'Brien - and a project such as that at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne and right across the nation as well so we have got proper, integrated cancer care for this disease which remains the nation's single largest killer.We are investing in all this infrastructure to create what we need to turbocharge productivity growth in the future for the recovery but also, critically, to support jobs on the way through and to make a difference in the impact of this recession.Then, we are out there supporting small business. The temporary investment allowance, a 50 per cent deduction for small business through until the end of this year, is a positive step by the government to assist small businesses facing real problems now out there in the economy. I was surprised and disappointed this morning when I was advised that the member for North Sydney had attacked this initiative which had been put forward by the government. Furthermore, there is the extension of the first home owners boost by a further three months, until 30 September, then staged down by one step before returning to where it was as of 1 January. We know from the housing data the impact that that has had on the residential construction sector in the country and all those jobs that depend on it.We have done this, this investment in infrastructure in the future, as well as provided jobs and support for small business in the here and now, in a fiscal strategy, a fiscal plan for the future, which is sustainable into the forward estimates and beyond. Our plan, very simply, is to halve the temporary deficit in three years and return the budget to surplus in six. It is a very clear-cut plan. That is what we have articulated in the budget papers. I again challenge the Leader of the Opposition to produce similar clarity in his budget reply tomorrow night. If he fails to do so, it will be simply white noise.In this budget, we are delivering on this plan also through $22.6 billion in savings this year, coming on the back of $33 billion of savings which were delivered in the 2008-09 budget. If you put those figures together, the two budgets that we have presented as a government, that is $55 billion worth of savings. Contrast that with the last two years that those opposite were in office. They delivered a total max of $7.5 billion in savings across their last two budgets when the member for Higgins was sitting there awash with cash flowing in from the mining boom - the mining boom which all of them over there hoped would last forever, deriding those of us on the other side of the House when we dared ask when the mining boom would come to a close. We are therefore framing a strategy of fiscal sustainability based on hard savings - $22 billion this year and $33 billion last year, something like eight times the total amount of savings which those opposite delivered in their last two budgets.I also draw the attention of those opposite to how, therefore, our temporary borrowing for temporary deficit strategy rests with international comparisons. Those opposite squirm when they hear the comparisons that our temporary budget deficit will be less than half that of the major advanced economies in the year ahead. They squirm about the fact that for the question of our temporary budget deficit for a temporary debt that will flow to the economy, we will have a temporary debt for Australia which will be the lowest by a country mile compared with all other major advanced economies. Furthermore, when you look at when our temporary debt will reach its height at 13.8 per cent of GDP, that will represent about one-seventh of the debt of the major advanced economies across the world. I would simply draw the attention of those opposite, as they try to score political capital out of this point and this necessary intervention in the economy at this stage, to what Standard and Poor's have said overnight. They said:Tonight's Commonwealth budget is consistent with Australia's triple A long-term rating for the country. The triple A rating is the highest rating assigned by Standard and Poor's.They go on to say:We - That is, Standard and Poor's - believe the deficits and associated borrowings do not alter the sound profile of the country's public finances.This is underpinned by the strength of the government's balance sheet, which provides flexibility to absorb debt levels and cyclical deficits of this nature.That is what the ratings agency Standard and Poor's has concluded about the budget we delivered last night. It also rests on the comparisons which exist between Australia's net debt over time as being lower by a country mile than the net debt of the other major advanced economies and, as I said, one-seventh of that when we reach the peak of our net debt at 13.8 per cent of GDP. Bearing in mind what the member for North Sydney has confirmed today, which is that his debt for this country would be $25 billion less than that which we are providing and proposing by way of the government for our plans going forward, I would suggest that the member for North Sydney reflects long and hard on the observations from Standard and Poor's and Moody's and the other agencies as well.When we are out there investing in construction for infrastructure for tomorrow to support jobs and small business and apprenticeships for today, let us also reflect on this point. When a future generation of kids looks back at the time when their state-of-the-art 21st century library was built in their primary school they will point back to the actions of this Labor government which used this recession in order to invest in that library. - I notice that the member for Higgins regards such an investment as humorous. He regards as an object of ridicule the building of state-of-the-art science centres in secondary schools right across regional Australia, which are somewhat removed from the type of school he attended himself. Also with our investment in state-of-the-art science centres and language centres you will have a generation of kids looking back and saying, 'These advances in our schools, these investments in modernising our schools, came off the back of a Labor government. It is prepared to get in there and have a go, investing in the infrastructure we need for the future while providing jobs, apprenticeships and support for apprentices here and now.'This government has crafted a strategy for the future, which we believe is robust and strong. It is a nation-building plan for recovery, a nation-building plan for the future, as opposed to the cobbled-together 'Hoover' plan being advocated by those opposite, if ever they could possibly harness their act and get it together and coordinate a position, at least for a 30-minute stretch of time.</DOC>

 - We cannot wait to see how much more he is going to cut. If he thinks we have not cut enough, he is now confirming that he is going to cut a lot more. Of course he has got to confirm tomorrow night what they are going to save in the budget to pay for the pension increase. That is a very big task that is building up for the shadow Treasurer. But as I said before, in the 2009-10 budget there are savings of $22.7 billion. In the 2008-09 budget there were savings over four years of $33 billion. That is a very substantial effort. - In this budget what we put in place was absolutely essential economic stimulus to support jobs, to support businesses, to support households and to support regions, because of what has been imposed on this country by the rest of the world. And what he is confirming again is that the official position of the Liberal Party is to do a lot less - not to borrow and therefore to savagely put up taxes or to savagely cut services. That is the position of the Liberal Party of Australia.It is not a position even shared by the business community that are normally more supportive of those opposite. The common-sense proposition is that when you have such a sharp contraction of private demand the government has to move in to stimulate demand to support jobs, to support households and to support businesses. That is something that simply does not occur to them. What we have got is an opportunistic play here from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer - a whole heap of confusion and fuzziness - because they are not up to the job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for the question because she, like many in this House coming from Tasmania, understands the importance of energy transformation in Australia. I say that because, coming from northern Tasmania, she comes from a state which has historically made a major contribution to the renewable energy market in Australia - historically Hydro Tasmania and in more recent times the development of wind energy through the assistance of Roaring 40s. That is why the Clean Energy Initiative of the government is very important. It is about building the energy infrastructure of tomorrow. That is exceptionally important to Australia at the moment because it is about not only energy security but also putting in place the necessary investment to enable Australia to achieve its ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions.On that note, it is an absolute priority for Australia to front up to the need to make a complete transformation of energy technology as we know it. That is not just about our traditional reliance on coal-fired power stations; it is also about bringing through new investment in areas such as renewable energy, aided and assisted by the implementation of a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 and in association with finalising the debate - which goes to investment security in Australia, something that is expected by the private sector - with respect to putting a price on carbon. Hence the importance of resolving, this year, the debate concerning the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme because it actually finalises an investment horizon which enables us to achieve energy security in the 21st century.This energy security debate, in association with our Clean Energy Initiative, is very central to the debate with respect to jobs. We are talking about an investment of $4.5 billion but, through a new partnership with the private sector and state governments, we will be able to leverage over $10 billion in Australia. This initiative will make a further major contribution to the issue of job creation as we go through this global financial crisis.It is about nation building for recovery. In the context of carbon capture and storage, we are talking about a $2.4 billion investment which is going to bring substantial investment by the private sector and state governments in resolving what is all important to Australia both from an energy security point of view and from an export point of view, as we are a major exporter of coal. Carbon capture and storage is a must for Australia. It is very important both from an energy security point of view and from the point of view of reducing our carbon emissions. Our carbon capture initiatives are a world first. We have already put in place offshore storage capacity - world-first legislation - and we are now in the process of considering commercial investment in that offshore storage capacity.The new part of the investment strategy, as embodied in our Clean Energy Initiative, of this budget goes also to a world first in terms of solar technology. We have placed on the table for consideration by state and territory governments in association with the private sector an investment of $1.6 billion to be invested in large-scale power generation in a solar flagships program. The target of 1,000 megawatts of solar power represents three times the size of the largest solar energy project in the world today. It means that potentially we in Australia will put in place in the foreseeable future four individual power generation projects, solar thermal, in association with the further development of solar photovoltaic opportunities in Australia - important from a baseload point of view. In association with our focus on solar energy, we are looking at other renewable sources, such as geothermal, wave and biomass. Renewables Australia represents an overall investment of $465 million to support leading-edge technology research, development and demonstration projects.In conclusion, the Australian community expects this investment horizon. The key to any economy is energy security, and in order to maintain energy security in Australia in the 21st century we have to appropriately focus on the transformation of energy technology to achieve a reduction in carbon emissions. The nation building for recovery program of the government will enable us to build the energy infrastructure of tomorrow and in doing so not only ensure energy security but also lower emissions and, importantly, assist in job creation in a very difficult economic circumstance.</DOC>

 - Some mothers do have them, Mr Speaker! It is unbelievable. We are charting a course back to surplus. - We have put in place an expenditure cap once growth returns to trend of two per cent. It is going to be a very, very tough discipline for this government or any other government into the future - a very tough discipline. That is why we have put in place our long-term savings. That is why we took our savings responsibilities so seriously last year and why we have taken them so seriously this year - this year particularly because of events in the global economy and particularly because we had to make some room for the pension increase. We had to make some long-term structural saves, and we have done that. We have a responsible course of action but the weight is now on those opposite: where are they going to make the savings? They say they are not going to run a deficit, they say they are going to support the pension increase, so where are the savings? They are simply not credible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I know that she and members of the House who are interested in jobs today and jobs of the future will be very interested to see this part of the budget documents, Transforming Australia's higher education system, which delivers the government's response to the Bradley and Cutler reviews and which charts a future vision for Australian higher education and also records our infrastructure spend for higher education for universities and vocational education and training to support jobs today. This is the next chapter of our education revolution, to ensure that our universities can be a world-class system receiving the resources that they need to offer the quality that Australian students want, to increase the number of Australians with qualifications at the undergraduate level or beyond, to increase the participation of Australians from lower income backgrounds in Australian higher education, and to chart a new vision for research and for innovation. It is this blueprint for reform which has been hailed by the Group of Eight universities as 'visionary'. It is this blueprint for reform that delivers $5.7 billion to our higher education and innovation systems over the next four years.Detailed in this document is our major infrastructure investment to support jobs today in the institutions which will matter so much for the jobs of tomorrow. In this budget we announced almost $3 billion for infrastructure in universities, vocational education and training, and research from the Education Investment Fund. This investment included an announcement of $934 million for 31 projects from the Education Investment Fund for round 2. Twelve of the successful projects are in vocational education and training, 11 are for higher education teaching and learning facilities and eight are for research. Taking into account funding that is also being provided by the project proponents, the total value of these projects is $1.8 billion.I am not surprised that the member for Cunningham asked me this question because she would have seen in this document a major new investment in the University of Wollongong: $43.8 million for the Australian Institute for Innovation Materials. I am sure that there are members on this side of the House, including the member for Ballarat and the member for Bendigo, who would have looked at this list last night with some sense of excitement about the possibilities that it meant for their local universities.The budget also provides a further $500 million for the Education Investment Fund round 3, and $200 million of this round will be to support the structural adjustment of Australian universities as they move towards a demand driven system for the future. The government has also announced a sustainability round worth $650 million, with $400 million to be dedicated to research infrastructure related to the Clean Energy Initiative, which my colleague the minister for resources has just been outlining to the House, and a $250 million investment for vocational education and training, higher education and research infrastructure related to climate change and sustainability activities. As part of the Australian government's commitment to creating and supporting the jobs of the future, there is the planned allocation of $2.5 billion of funds into the Education Investment Fund, to be allocated to the groundbreaking Clean Energy Initiative, clean energy obviously being such an important part of the jobs of the future. I wait with interest, like other members of the House, to see whether tomorrow night we will find out that all of the money to support Australia's universities and vocational education and training institutes will be cut by the opposition, as they are part of the things that the shadow Treasurer will cut, because we do know of course that the track record of the Liberal Party is not to support higher education. I will be waiting to see whether that is one of the things that they will be saying they will take a saving from.</DOC>

 - Not at all because I have been committed to fiscal discipline the whole of my political life, because I understand it is fundamental for long-term growth and job creation in the economy. -  - The Prime Minister and I and the finance minister are committed to fiscal discipline, which is why we have put in place our budget rules, which I was talking about before - unlike those opposite, who, when it was raining gold bars during the mining boom, could not find enough money to put a basic pension increase in for single age pensioners. Shame on them! They could not find enough money to invest in basic infrastructure. Shame on them! They had an absolutely appalling record of not finding savings. They spent like drunken sailors at the top of the boom and now the global recession has shone a very bright light on that.Let us just look at the savings record of the government compared to that of the previous government. This government has found savings over two budgets of $55 billion, $22.6 billion in this budget and $33 billion in the last budget. This is the record of the previous Liberal government: last budget $3.2 billion in savings for 2007-08, in 2006-07 only $4.3 billion, and in 2005-06 $4.6 billion. They were there at the top of the mining boom and it was raining gold bars and they could not look after pensioners, they could not invest in infrastructure and now they have got the hide to come into this House and claim they know what fiscal discipline means. They have not got a clue, and the country is now living with the consequences of some of the practices of those opposite as well as the global recession. We will deal with the global recession in a responsible and mature way, and we have done that, and we will chart the course back to surplus in a fiscally responsible way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her contribution to small business development in this country, because she ran a small business for seven years and an association that represented small businesses. So I say thank you very much to the member for Parramatta.This is a budget of nation building for recovery. The budget is supporting jobs today by building the infrastructure Australia needs for tomorrow. The Commonwealth Treasury advises that up to 210,000 Australians would be out of work if not for the stimulus packages that we have initiated and for this budget. We have made the tough savings to deliver the lowest level of net debt of all major advanced economies.In respect of small business, the budget boosts incentives and support for small businesses by well over $500 million. I will go through some of the measures. The government will increase the small business tax break from 30 per cent to 50 per cent and extend it from 30 June this year until the end of the year. Small business owners around Australia in the forums that I have been doing for the last few months tell me that what they really need is some extra advice during the global economic recession, and we are responding to that with a small business support line at a cost of $10 million so that they get that timely advice and support that they need.The budget also provides another $10 million to establish a small business online program - maybe the member for Higgins could take advantage of that with his new, you-beaut website - so that small businesses are really well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the National Broadband Network. There is a new research and development tax credit, which will double the incentive for small businesses to undertake research and development in this country. I remind members here that when the Howard-Costello government came to office in 1996, they cut that R&amp;D tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. This restores the effective rate of support for small businesses to undertake research and development back up to an effective 150 per cent. That is very good news for small business. I could spend more time going through a whole range of other initiatives that are contained in this budget for small business. -  - Despite the encouragement that I am getting from my colleagues, I am conscious of the hour -  - and I think, in deference to you, Mr Speaker, I should not spend another quarter of an hour going through that, which would be a mercy to the coalition. But I do make this point: the initiatives contained in the budget build on the $42 billion stimulus package - a nation-building economic stimulus package which we call a 'tradies package' because two-thirds of that stimulus is to build infrastructure in Australia, whether it is in our schools or on our roads or local council infrastructure. That is very important to support our tradies.I am very disappointed, again, with the shadow Treasurer, who said that this is far too much money and that the coalition would not spend anywhere near that money on supporting tradies and supporting small businesses. Of course, we know that the Leader of the Opposition will put into his budget reply speech tomorrow night some references to small business - how they love small business and how they support small business - but we have the shadow Treasurer saying that, no, they would not put anywhere near the sort of money that we would put into the tradies package to support our small businesses. He has been a constant carping critic of our small business tax break, saying, 'No-one will take that up.' An Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey for the March quarter shows that 31 per cent of businesses have said that they will bring forward investment in plant and equipment to take advantage of that tax break. If they were doing that when the rate was 30 per cent, imagine what they are going to do when the rate is 50 per cent. This is a very strong initiative for small business.It is not just me saying this; it is the Council of Small Business of Australia, who said that 'small business is recognised as the backbone of Australia's economy in budget 2009'. We have the Master Builders of Australia saying that they 'welcome the increase in the small business investment tax allowance from the current level of 30 per cent to 50 per cent'. - Well, why don't you get on board? You have the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry saying that 'the extension of the investment allowance to 50 per cent for small business until December 2009 is an excellent initiative' and 'a stimulus measure first proposed by ACCI and our members'.We have the farmers again supporting Labor's initiatives. The farmers are saying, 'Farmers will also welcome the small business tax break increase on capital works investment' - the very tax break increase that the coalition criticises and says, 'Farmers won't take it up; no-one will take it up.' Let's ask the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. In a release just out, hot off the press, they say:The Federal Government's Budget decision to increase and extend the investment tax break for small business provides a valuable incentive for new vehicle sales. The tax break will help stimulate the new vehicle market and support jobs in the industryThere you go - supporting our jobs; supporting our tradies.But what is happening on the coalition side? It is an unfolding tragedy because, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, the Leader of the Opposition has said, on cue -  - I was cut to the quick by that comment, Mr Speaker. I was asked about reactions and I have been explaining some of the reactions to the budget, but there are other reactions to the budget. The opposition leader has said that he would have a small deficit or a small surplus - that is $50 billion worth of increased taxes or $50 billion of cuts in expenditure. What did we have on the same day, within 18 minutes? We had the shadow Treasurer saying that it would be $25 billion smaller. So we have one saying $50 billion to be cut and another saying $25 billion. And, of course, my counterpart, the shadow minister for small business, independent contractors, tourism and the arts, got into the act, saying just the other day that for this year the deficit will be 50 per cent lower. We know that tomorrow night all expectations are there for the Leader of the Opposition -  - All expectations are there for the Leader of the Opposition to say where he is going to cut expenditure and increase taxes. They are a disorganised rabble. They support Hoovernomics; they just do not know whether it is J Edgar Hoover, Herbert Hoover or the inventor of the vacuum cleaner.</DOC>

 - The government's planning for defence is fully accounted for in the government's budget going forward and is consistent with the recommendations contained in the defence white paper. On the question of the Australian Business Investment Partnership the honourable member would be aware that that matter currently lies before the parliament and has not yet passed. The provision for it is outlined in legislation which is before the Senate. As for the other element of the honourable gentleman's question, which referred to the National Broadband Network, the equity injection into it is contained, again, in the budget papers. I would draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that at the time that we announced our plans for a national broadband network we indicated that we would consult with the private sector with a view to establishing appropriate levels of equity between the private sector and us in constructing a much needed national project.I would also say to the honourable gentleman in answering the question that the reason the government has acted on a national broadband network is that for 12 years the opposition, the then government, did absolutely nothing when it came to national broadband. There they sat for 12 years, with the rest of the world skating by and leaving Australia in its wake, with no high-speed broadband across the country. They fiddled and they faddled and they did nothing, and they left people in regional Australia without effective broadband connection. We have taken a decisive course of action to embrace this challenge for the future and those opposite have simply squibbed it. We are proud of the fact that we are acting in the national interest in providing this much needed infrastructure for Australia for the future and supporting jobs, supporting small business for today and investing in infrastructure we need for tomorrow. The provisions are contained within the budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The government is embracing a strategy of nation building for recovery. That is the strategy reflected in the budget document we released to the parliament earlier this week and that is the strategy we are implementing across the nation today. Its essence is that we are supporting jobs and small business today by investing in the nation building infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That is why we are investing in roads, rail and ports right across the country. That is why we are investing in the single largest school modernisation program in the country's history. That is why we are investing in what we are advised will be the world's largest solar power plant through the clean energy initiative. That is why we are investing also in a range of other infrastructure measures including hospitals, medical research facilities, schools, universities and TAFEs. The objective of all these things is to support jobs and to support small business in the here and now by investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. - Today in the company of the member for Hunter I participated in the announcement locally of the Hunter expressway, a project of $1.65 billion. This is a project that those opposite, as the member for Paterson will know full well, promised in the 2004 election. And what did they do after the 2004 election? Nothing. In 2004 they made a bold promise about funding this road, much needed in that local area, and those opposite when in government did nothing. What we have done in our first year of office is commit funding for this project, announced today conjointly with the government of New South Wales, with construction commencing in the year 2010. I notice the member for Paterson constantly interjects. He doth protest too much. He has been sprung and spotlighted by this one - and it is not all that difficult to spotlight the member for Paterson from time to time, although there is less of him these days!The member for Paterson is a classic illustration in this place of members saying one thing in their electorates and doing nothing about it in Canberra. He said in 2004 that he would have this road project funded but nothing was actually done about it in the subsequent term of office.The project will cut travel times between Newcastle and the Hunter by 28 minutes; relieve congestion between Newcastle and the towns of Thornton, Maitland and Rutherford, with forecast reductions in traffic from a level of 60,000 vehicles now by 15,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day; support the growing Hunter region, where traffic is forecast to grow at around four per cent per year; and meet the growing freight task of the region, which is forecast to increase 30 per cent in coming years. The project will support up to 800 jobs directly in its construction. This is part of our long-term plan for the construction of network 1 to provide a proper freight network right across the Australian east coast. - I notice that the Leader of the National Party intervened about a road between Cooroy and Curra. Is that right? That is a part of the world known to me and to him, and it is in his electorate. As transport minister he took not a single action; as local member he took not a single action. He represents a constituency where, he said in today's paper, he drives with fear and trembling because of the road accidents there - but he did nothing. This government is providing funding for an investment in his electorate because national needs determined it should be there. He has a record of zero action. We have a record of commitment to action and we have funding on the table to do it.Also today, with the member for Hunter, I participated in the launch of the Hunter Valley rail. This is an important project as well, because we turned a sod on one of those projects funded under the Australian government's $4.7 billion nation-building statement of last December. The construction of the third rail track on the main northern railway in the Hunter is part of the government's $1.2 billion investment in the Australian Rail Track Corporation. The government has invested more in rail freight in its first 18 months than the previous government did in 12 years. There are six rail projects across the Hunter being delivered as a result of our investment, creating up to 650 jobs in the local area.These are practical actions which demonstrate our approach to dealing with the recession - supporting jobs, small business and business more generally today in order to create the infrastructure for tomorrow. Our approach to this recession is to embark upon a clear-cut strategy for the future. To make these investments it is necessary for the government to have temporary deficit and temporary debt. The Leader of the Opposition says that he does not support the government's current level of deficit and debt to invest in infrastructure, to support jobs and to respond to the recession. That is what he said. The Liberal Party Treasury spokesman said yesterday that he supports $25 billion less debt than the government. Tonight, therefore, the Leader of the Opposition -  - He now says, 'It's a starting point.' A new position! So, somewhere in no-man's-land yesterday, between the Leader of the Opposition's statement that he would not name a target and the Treasury spokesman's statement 16 minutes earlier that he would name a target - $25 billion - we now have a no-man's-land position of somewhere in between. The Leader of the Opposition says that he does not support the government's current level of deficit and debt to invest in infrastructure, to support jobs and to counter the recession. The Liberal Party Treasury spokesman, although he objects to it today, said yesterday that he supports $25 billion less debt than the government. Tonight, therefore, the Leader of the Opposition must name his level of debt - name his additional savings - because refusal to do so confirms that in fact he is doing nothing but running a dishonest scare campaign. - He doth protest too much, Joe! - Well, Joe, it was not the best of days yesterday; you know that. It was not the best of days. Tonight, the Leader of the Opposition must name his level of debt - his level of borrowing -  - It is always good to hear from the member for Sturt - he who asserted recently that the Asian financial crisis was just as serious as the current global economic recession. That was his great statement of economic literacy! I heard him recently make that proclamation. How absolutely unfounded and ridiculous a proposition. - Tonight, therefore, the Leader of the Opposition has a very clear responsibility. Tonight, therefore, the Leader of the Opposition must nominate what level of debt he supports, what level of savings and what savings he will advance. On top of that he must indicate precisely what course of action he is going to take. He must nominate the level of debt, nominate the level of savings and nominate the actual savings, because failure to do so will demonstrate the absolute fraudulence of the fear campaign he is running on debt today. That is the bottom line. Name the level of debt and name the savings that you will advance. Otherwise you are confirming that this is nothing more than a baseless scare campaign on debt. You are attempting to conceal the fact that the Liberal Party's position on debt is, in essence, virtually the same as the government's. That is what they do not want exposed.If he does not name a debt level tonight, or specify the savings tonight, he will in fact drive a stake through the heart of his own scare campaign. You can see how the tombstone will read when it is all done: 'Here lies the Liberal Party scare campaign, tragically killed on 14 May 2009 because the Leader of the Opposition couldn't nominate a level of debt or a level of savings.' The fraudulence of this position on the part of those opposite stands clear and loud for all to see.</DOC>

 - The question from the Leader of the Nationals is simply astounding. There was no provision in their budgets for forward years for drought relief - none. This budget contains $866 million to support primary producers, including $715 million to extend drought assistance for 2009-10. That is the practice that the former government put in place; it did not make forward provisions for drought assistance. We have said that we are looking at all of the arrangements. When we have concluded doing that we will put in place our arrangements for the future and do what the previous government never could do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. It is certainly the case that the Australian economy is much stronger than those of many other developed countries around the world. In the middle of this global recession, the worst one in 75 years, we have seen many advanced economies contract sharply. We have seen global trade collapse. We have seen production collapse. Eight of Australia's top 10 trading partner economies are expected to contract this year. On top of that, China has slowed, Japan has gone into negative growth and India has slowed dramatically. This is having a brutal impact on growth, jobs and budget revenues here in Australia.As we saw in the budget, growth is expected to contract by half a per cent in 2009-10. Despite that contraction, Australia is expected to do much better than all other advanced economies. In fact, I know from talking to colleagues at G20 meetings that many of them sitting around that table would trade places with Australia any day, given the outcomes that we are receiving here compared to the rest of the world. Our forecast contraction is much milder than that of many of the other advanced 20 economies, the high-income economies, around the world. It is certainly much better than the 3¾ per cent contraction expected for advanced economies as a whole. If we just go through them, the US is expected to contract by three per cent, the euro area is expected to contract by four per cent and Japan is expected to contract by a massive six per cent.Of course, it is the case that unemployment here is forecast to rise to 8½ per cent by June 2011 as the impacts of this global recession flow through our economy. But what we need to keep in mind is that that is less than the double-digit rates expected for many other advanced economies, although it is much higher than anyone would like. As we know, our budget has been hard hit by the global recession. Our revenues have been written down to the tune of $210 billion. These write-downs account for something like two-thirds of the write-down in the overall budget position since the last budget. Of course, even after these revenue write-downs, the government's financial position remains amongst the strongest in the world. The forecast budget deficit of 4.9 per cent of GDP for 2009-10 is less than half the average of major advanced economies, at 10.4 per cent, while net debt at its peak of 13.8 per cent in 2013-14 is much, much lower than the 80 per cent of GDP net debt levels projected for all advanced economies. So we are not immune from the impacts of this global recession but we are still much better placed than many other countries in the world.A large part of the reason for that is that this government acted, it acted early and it acted decisively with economic stimulus. And in this budget we are nation building for the recovery, putting in place the vital investments that will support jobs now and create the jobs of tomorrow by expanding the productive capacity of our economy, by making the necessary investments in ports, road, rail and broadband - investments for the future that are so important to assist us not only to fight this global recession but to deal in the long term with the ageing of our population. We are doing better here because we moved earlier, because the government was decisive and took the courageous decisions to put in place vital economic stimulus.Without our economic strategy, without our stimulus, unemployment would peak 1½ percentage points higher, reaching double digits. That is why our action, and moving so early, are so important. If we had done the opposite, if we had done what those opposite said we should do, which was to sit and to wait and to see, unemployment would be far higher, the recession would be far deeper and the recession would be longer. But this government acted - and we acted in the interest of jobs, we acted in the interest of business and we acted in the long-term national interest of the country.But tonight those opposite have a unique opportunity. They have been going on about deficit and debt. They have been going on about deficit and borrowing. Well, tonight they get the opportunity to tell the Australian people where they are going to make their savings from. They can put their money where their mouth is this evening. If they are going to be taken seriously, they will have to nominate savings this evening. Otherwise, they will have taken hold of and will be responsible for that debt. This country has had imposed on it a huge cut in its national income which has required borrowing to support employment. If they say they can bring debt down and borrowing down then they had better nominate where the savings are coming from - put their money where their mouth is - because, if they do not, they will have no credibility whatsoever.</DOC>

 - If I could just follow up on that question and make this very simple point. The shadow Treasurer has said that he would borrow $25 billion less - that is what the shadow Treasurer has said, so he is admitting to borrowing $275 billion. He is admitting to borrowing $275 billion, and the interest on that will be the market rate at the time that it is borrowed. - That should be obvious to anybody. - Perhaps -  -  -  - So further borrowings to support employment, further borrowings to support infrastructure, further borrowings to support jobs will come at the market rate at the time the money is borrowed. But the average interest rate paid on recent bond tenders has been 3.88 per cent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. Members who have perused the budget papers will note that the government is forecasting a dramatic drop in government revenue over the next few years, and I particularly draw their attention to the figures for the next two financial years: $49 billion and $55 billion. Of course, the government is projecting deficits over those two years of $57 billion in each case. This does indicate that the vast bulk of the problem the government is dealing with in this fiscal situation is derived from the fact that we have had a huge hit to government revenue as a result of the global recession. That has been a major contributor to the fact that we are now in a position of temporary deficit.These circumstances do present the government with a choice. The government can either seek to contract the economy, to contract the fiscal position, to increase taxes and to reduce spending in order to cover that deficit or, alternatively, borrow temporarily to cover that deficit. That is essentially the choice that the government is presented with. The government has chosen to borrow over that period of time and it has chosen to stimulate economic activity through its Nation Building and Jobs Plan and other initiatives in the budget to sustain jobs, to sustain economic activity and to sustain businesses in the face of the most savage global downturn in living memory. Treasury estimates that this package will sustain GDP to the tune of about 2.75 per cent in the forthcoming financial year and 1½ per cent in the year after that and that it will in the process support over 200,000 jobs in the economy.I note that the Australian Financial Review in its editorial yesterday stated this - and it is not normally given to praising the government in its editorial, I might add. I am sure the Prime Minister will be astonished to hear that! Normally it does not praise the government in its editorial but it did on this occasion state:The government cannot be faulted for running deficits to stimulate activity and protect jobs. That is what governments are meant to do when the world economy turns down _That is the Financial Review. The opposition, of course, are advocating an alternative strategy which they say would mean a much lower deficit, which inevitably would mean either higher taxes or lower spending, or both, and in particular would mean sucking vast amounts of money out of economic activity - that is, tens of billions of dollars out of the economy, out of sustaining jobs, out of sustaining business activity. That is precisely the error that conservatives in many countries made in the 1930s through things like the Premiers Plan in Australia, which cut wages, which cut benefits and which ultimately compounded the problem of recession and turned it into the Great Depression. It created a downward spiral of ever-mounting unemployment, ever-mounting business losses and ever-mounting misery. We do not intend to repeat the mistake that conservatives made in the 1930s.But it is still unclear what the opposition's position actually is on these issues. We note that the member for North Sydney says that the deficit should be $25 billion lower than what the government says, yet the Leader of the Opposition says that if he were in charge there might even be a small surplus. So you have got a deficit of $30-odd billion from the member for North Sydney, but the Leader of the Opposition suggests that if he were in charge there might have been a small surplus.We will see some indication of where these divisions land this evening. This evening when we finally hear the budget reply we will see some indication of how these divisions within the Liberal opposition come into collision and where the final landing point is. They have become so divided and such a rabble that in recent weeks they have even been given to giving themselves names that are so offensive I am not even allowed to mention them in parliament! They have even been able to give themselves and their internal workings some appellations that would be unparliamentary if I referred to them in this House. That is an indication of how bitter and how deeply divided the Liberal opposition have become and how incoherent they have become on the fundamentally important issues facing this nation.Tonight the opposition has to front up and explain how its position of less spending and lower taxes would lead to lower deficits and less debt and yet without any savings and with lower taxes how that all would add up to a single coherent position. Tonight is the time you have to front up, when all of the one-liners and all of the rhetoric and all of the contradictory grabs between the member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition have to be added up to a single position. Tonight we will be watching with great interest to see where all this lands and how the great Ponzi scheme of the Liberal opposition's position adds up. We wait with great interest to see how you can get together more spending, lower taxes, lower debt and lower deficit into a single position in a single reply.</DOC>

 - In terms of the government's borrowings, roughly the same percentage is being borrowed overseas now as was borrowed overseas when those opposite were in government. -  - When those opposite were in government and when they left office I think there was something like $55 billion worth of Commonwealth securities on issue. I know it is a bit inconvenient for those opposite to acknowledge that but that is the fact. - About two-thirds, or a little less than that then, was borrowed overseas and the same percentage, roughly, is the case today - about two-thirds. What we have seen on display here is just monumental hypocrisy. Those opposite know that the government is borrowing because revenue write-downs have hit $210 billion and the alternative to borrowing that money is to savagely jack up taxes or savagely cut services. If they are sitting here today saying that they are not going to borrow then the Leader of the Opposition has to come into this House tonight and show where he is going to cut $210 billion from the revenue write-downs. That is what he has to do tonight. If he does not do that he does not have a shred of economic credibility. Nothing could better demonstrate how out of touch the Liberal Party has become than their proposition that in the middle of the sharpest contraction since the Great Depression that a government should not borrow to support employment in the economy. What we are doing is in the national economic interest.Our budget is all about nation building for recovery, nation building for jobs and building the productive capacity of the economy for the future, particularly to deal with the ageing of the population. To do those things to protect our people from the ravages of a global recession we are borrowing responsibly. But the thrust of the questioning in here day in and day out is somehow to make us believe that if they were in government today they would not have to borrow one cent. If that is the proposition that is being advanced then the Leader of the Opposition must tonight show how he is going to make up for the revenue that has been lost to this country - that is, a revenue loss that has been imposed on this country by the rest of the world. Revenue of $210 billion has been lost, which is the equivalent of all the spending on health and hospitals over the forward estimates. - This evening the Leader of the Opposition has to indicate to the Australian people where he is going to make the savings to make up for the revenue loss or what taxes he proposes to dramatically increase to make up for the revenue loss. That is what he has to do this evening; otherwise he will be endorsing the responsible borrowing that this government is doing.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Canberra not only for her question but also for her leadership on behalf of carers as the chair of the House of Representatives inquiry into support for carers. The government's secure and sustainable pension reform package will deliver essential and long overdue recognition to people with disabilities and to carers. From 20 September this year, the government will deliver increases to people on the carer payment and those receiving the disability support pension of $32.49 for singles on the full rate and $10.14 for couples on the full rate. These rises are on top of the existing allowances for GST, utilities, telephone, internet and pharmaceuticals. There are 720,000 disability support pensioners and 140,000 carer payment recipients who will receive this increase.Around 500,000 carers across Australia will also receive a new payment, the new permanent $600 carer supplement. This supplement will go to people who receive the carer payment, the veterans carer service pension or the carer allowance, and it will be $600 for each of the people that they care for. People who receive both carer payment and carer allowance will receive two carer supplement payments. This supplement and the additions to the disability support pension and carer payment have been welcomed by both carer groups and those representing people with disabilities. Carers Australia Chief Executive Joan Hughes said, 'The $600 a year supplement was very welcome because its status was assured in future budgets.' From the Spinal Injuries Association we had, 'People with disability are pleased that their living costs have been recognised.' I am very pleased to be able to tell Australia's carers that just a short time ago today the Senate passed the bill introducing this new permanent $600 supplement. This is a huge win for Australia's carers. Their first $600 supplement will be delivered before the end of June.The government's reforms have involved some very difficult decisions - decisions like lifting the age pension age - decisions that in 12 years the previous government did not make despite the former Treasurer's enthusiasm for releasing reports about our ageing population. Here are just a few words from the member for Higgins back in 2007. He said:The first Intergenerational Report put the ageing of the population on the map._            _            _We started talking about fertility rates and pushing back retirement ages _Now here we are five years later. The member for Higgins of course was still only talking, as he is today. The member for Warringah by contrast has at least woken up to the fact that talking about something is not the same as doing it. - The member for Warringah has woken up! This morning he actually said that the age pension age should go up more quickly than that being proposed by the government. So we hope to hear from the Leader of the Opposition tonight in his budget reply: is this now Liberal Party policy? Is he going to confirm the member for Warringah's statement this morning that the age pension age should go up more quickly? Of course the member for Higgins was not prepared to act when he was in government. Let us see whether the Leader of the Opposition is going to support the member for Warringah tonight.</DOC>

 - This is just astounding - a question about foreign debt from the shadow Treasurer! Foreign debt exploded under the Liberal Party. Get this. Between 1996 and 2007 the Liberals left the nation with a 200 per cent increase in net foreign debt, a 460 per cent increase in credit card debt, a 340 per cent increase in household debt, a tripling of private sector debt and a 450 per cent increase in corporate debt. So - with an appalling record like that - they should be the last people to come into this House and lecture anyone about levels of debt. - I was actually asked about foreign debt. I would just like to go into what has been said by people over time about foreign debt. Who said, back in 1995: 'Foreign debt is a terrible thing. It is now the equivalent of $10,000 per head for every Australian'? Who said that in 1995? Peter Costello. And what happened to foreign debt from the time that the former Treasurer made that statement? It went up by 200 per cent. There was a massive explosion in foreign debt under the Liberals, and if the proposition being put forward by the shadow Treasurer -  - I was asked by the shadow Treasurer about foreign debt. Foreign debt back in 1995, according to Peter Costello on radio 5AN on 10 October 1995, was a terrible thing and it was $10,000 per head for every Australian. In September 2007, as Peter Costello left office, foreign debt was $589 billion or $29,450 per Australian. That is actually what has happened to foreign debt, which is what I was asked about by the shadow Treasurer. So that is the answer to your question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. This morning I visited the Hunter with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the member for Hunter and the Premier of New South Wales. There we visited a site where we saw the government's nation-building plans in action. In the Hunter the government's injection of $1.2 billion as part of its economic stimulus package last December is reaping real benefits in creating jobs today and in building the infrastructure that we need for tomorrow. One of those loop lines has already been opened, and today the Prime Minister turned the first sod on the first rail track on the main northern railway in the Hunter. This project itself will support some 150 of the 650 jobs that will be supported in the Hunter region.On the way there, we passed through Maitland, a community that will benefit from our investment in the new Hunter expressway. This is a project that the coalition promised to deliver but never did. There is more chance of finding a mention of Malcolm Turnbull on the Peter Costello website than there is of finding some real activity from those opposite when it comes to the Hunter expressway -  - because the real action was zero. - The member for Paterson, known as 'Paterson's curse' in the Hunter for his -  -  - To assist, Mr Speaker - when he sits down. - Paterson's curse is a purple flower. I did not know you were a shrinking violet, but I withdraw - unreservedly. If you want to actually look at what those opposite did, you can go to the 'Nationals audit office' report. The Nationals audit office is back. The Nationals audit office report on the delivery of projects on the AusLink national network makes terrific reading when it comes to their failure to deliver on their promises in the Hunter. It outlines how, in September 2005 in the AusLink agreement put up by the former government, the Howard government included funding for the project of some $382 million. It also outlines how the former government knew that in May 2005 the appropriate authorities had estimated the cost to be twice that: $765 million. What happened was that, as part of AusLink, they allocated $382 million and it just stayed there. It got reallocated and spent in other areas, not in the Hunter. They delivered nothing; through AusLink nothing was delivered. The majority of the money was set aside and allocated to other projects.But, of course, because they did nothing - with what was happening to the global economy with increased costs for steel and concrete and with the growth and boom in our region - costs went up. In July 2007 there was a new estimate, all outlined in this report. The RTA revised the cost estimate of the project to $1.2 billion in 2007 dollars, an out-turn cost of between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. In Tuesday night's budget, we allocated $1.65 billion - $1.45 billion from the Commonwealth and $200 million from New South Wales. The coalition knew about the revised cost. They knew about it, but in the heat of the 2007 election that counted for nothing. In November 2007, the then Prime Minister flew in to Williamtown air base and made a promise of $780 million for a project that they had been advised -  - All this is outlined in the Australian National Audit Office report. It is there on the record. They knew at that stage the cost was $1.2 billion in 2007 dollars, with out-turn costs of between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, but they made this nothing promise that did not exist.What you have to look at is what governments do in their budgets and what they do on the ground, not what they promise in the dying days of an election campaign, when they are walking out the door. The truth is they delivered nothing for the Hunter expressway. They delivered nothing for the people of the Hunter over 12 years. You know that it is consistent with their ideological approach, because their approach to nation-building infrastructure is that governments should get out of the way and that the market will sort it all out. That is essentially what they believe in their hearts. It is in their DNA, which is why you never hear about nation building from those opposite. The shadow Treasurer belled the cat when he said:You know what the biggest investment in infrastructure is? Investing in people. Giving them tax cuts, helping them pay their bills everyday. Giving them a job. That's what I call investing in infrastructure.Those on this side of the House believe that investing in infrastructure is about allocating real money in budgets, making sure that real people are employed today so that we build the infrastructure that we need for tomorrow.</DOC>

 - I am happy to answer the question. At the recent meetings of G20 leaders in London, it was decided that there should be a substantial increase in resources for the Internationally Monetary Fund, given the global recession and the dramatic impact that that global recession was having on the developing world, the impact that it was having on those nations and the subsequent impact that was having on world growth - which was feeding back into the global recession. The decision was taken by governments of all political persuasions around the world that in those circumstances it was the responsible course of action to increase the resources of the International Monetary Fund.Those opposite are fond of talking about the Asian financial crisis. Many opposite have compared it in size to this global recession. But we know that the global recession is much bigger and that it takes in both developed and developing countries. As part of this nation's response to the Asian financial crisis, very substantial moneys were lent to countries in the region by the former government, rightly and correctly.In the meeting of the G20 recently it was decided that the new arrangements to borrow should be increased. We agreed to that. Our proportion of borrowing under that new arrangement - which we have always contributed to, under the previous government and under this government - is going to increase. We have agreed, as part of the new arrangement to borrow, that there will be increased resources - loans, which will be repaid with interest - should they be required. We are making them available in exactly the same proportion that the previous government also made them available. There has been no fundamental change whatsoever.But what we seem to have now from the opposition is yet another example of tawdry, cheap and opportunistic politics. We are participating in the IMF in the same way as the previous government participated in it. We are doing it for very good reasons. We are doing it because it is good for this country economically, but we are also doing it because it is our responsibility - a responsibility that both sides of politics have adhered to over a long period of time. If that is changing as well, I would like to hear the Leader of the Opposition tell us what his position is. He is on the record, around the time of the G20 meeting, as supporting a very substantial increase. So we have his support, but obviously we do not have the support of one of his frontbenchers. That is yet another example of the confusion and disunity and the rabble that this opposition have become.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. I know that, when on budget night the government released the document Transforming Australia's higher education system and announced its intention to invest $5.7 billion in higher education over the next four years, she would have been delighted to see that in her local community the University of Ballarat is receiving $40 million for its science and engineering precinct and that a further $18 million has been committed for a manufacturing technology training centre. That is part of making sure through the Education Investment Fund that we have the capital investment necessary to have the learning institutions for the future of this nation in a knowledge economy and a globalised economy. This side of the House understands that our future is in a globalised economy, something that from recent questions clearly the opposition is denying.Those who care about education, those who care about our economic prosperity tomorrow, those who care about this nation making its way in a knowledge economy and those who care about every Australian child getting the best possible start in life have embraced this vision of higher education. If we go across the university sector, we see that Universities Australia has applauded the federal budget and this new vision for higher education. It said:The government has acted responsibly and in the nation's interest by increasing funding for teaching and learning with improved indexation from 2012, which will ensure teaching quality is maintained and enhanced.The Group of Eight, in a media release entitled 'Visionary road taken to university reform', said:The Government's response to the Cutler and Bradley reports will work to widen the base of Australia's higher education and strengthen university capacity research capability _From the Australian Technology Network of Universities, we have had the following statement. It said the budget was:_ the most significant in a decade, providing the building blocks for long lasting reform of the sector and the creation of a world class university system.The government believe in an education revolution. We believe in this nation taking its place in a knowledge economy. We believe in the building blocks of economic prosperity. On the other side of the House, one wonders. While those who care about education have been responding, we are still lacking any form of detailed policy response from the opposition to this transformation of Australia's higher education system. There has been no policy statement released by the shadow minister; there has been no substantive policy response. He did whip out one media release, full of bark but no bite. But in that media release there was one policy statement that Australians should understand. The shadow minister, in his only policy statement that I am aware of on universities - potentially his only policy statement on education - said:Last year the Government abolished all full fee places for Australian students - a private revenue stream for Universities that had been growing and providing economic security into the future _The only policy statement that the shadow minister for education has made in response to this report is to endorse Australian students paying full fees for their education.We know we are heading tonight to the opposition's leader's budget reply speech. We also know that if, in that speech, he does not name tonight a debt level or specify a savings target then he is going to drive a stake through the heart of his dishonest scare campaign about debt and deficits. It makes me wonder whether the complete eradication of university funding is on the savings list. - My simple point is this: the shadow minister for education never says anything substantive about education. Australians deserve better from the Liberal Party than a shadow minister who has no care or concern for his portfolio. - The opposition should outline a vision for Australian university education, if it has one. The only vision at the moment we have is one of complete privatisation. My simple point to the Leader of the Opposition is this: his dishonest scare campaign comes to an end tonight unless he can nominate savings targets to take the budget into the surplus he has talked about. Can he rule out that eradicating all public funding for universities is on that list? The only policy statement from his shadow minister is all about students paying the complete cost of their university education; there is nothing else.</DOC>

 - I read with much amusement the article in the Australian this morning. It is the most baseless article I have ever read. As the journalist who wrote the article I understand confirmed in the article, he telephoned my office and, prior to obtaining a reply from my office, went ahead and produced the article. My office rang back and he did not return that call. Though I know the journalist in question and have had a longstanding good relationship with him, this article is entirely a fabrication, and I question why it was produced in the way in which it was.I thank also the shadow foreign minister, as she now is, given her great track record of originality in all things. That has been part of her career trajectory from the shadow Treasury position into the shadow foreign ministry position. This question of originality concerns the importance that is attached to the United Nations and the Security Council. There were statements by the former foreign minister, Mr Downer, and by the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, about the importance of the United Nations General Assembly and about the importance of the United Nations Security Council. We, together with previous governments, both Labor and Liberal, are doing what all Australian governments have historically done, which is to obtain whatever support we can to try and prosecute a campaign for the future for Australia to obtain a position on the United Nations Security Council. In doing so, we are seeking to prosecute Australia's international interests in the long term.Part of those international interests in the long term goes also to our role in various international financial institutions. One of those financial institutions is the International Monetary Fund. The International Monetary Fund and our contribution to it, and in fact to other international monetary authorities, was raised recently by the member for xenophobia over there, the member for Aston, in the question that he raised before. We as a government have a deep interest in what fabric constitutes itself -  - I withdraw. It is good to see the spirit of Hansonism alive and well on the benches of those opposite. - Mr Speaker, my remarks were not about the member for Aston but about the opposition corporately for endorsing a question like that, which demonstrates that Hansonism is alive and well. To assist the House, I will of course withdraw.It goes to the question of contributions - and you should wrestle with your conscience on this one - to our international financial institutions. Of course, the single greatest set of contributions has been made recently by governments around the world, and prospectively by the Australian government, to the International Monetary Fund, for a range of reasons - firstly, to assist countries who are in deep need in their own financial circumstances; and, secondly, to ensure that we maintain the stability of the international financial system. That is why governments got together in London recently and agreed on a massive injection of resources into the IMF. - It is countries around the world, and the emerging world in particular - including in the continents just referred to by the shadow foreign minister, as she is these days - in which the International Monetary Fund operates. But the core principle, and why governments around the world support these institutions, is not only that it is inherently the right thing to do in the spirit of Bretton Woods going back to 1944 - which I think all decent governments and parties, Liberal and Labor, have supported from then until now - but it is also an investment in our collective self-interest. When it goes to economies in Europe, for example, if there is an implosion in those economies, the ricochet effect through Europe and global financial markets back to the domestic Australian financial market is significant and potentially extreme. Therefore, international financial institutions, properly resourced -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I note that in his point of order the member for Sturt said that the question dealt with the foreign aid budget. The foreign aid budget was not referred to at all, not in one word in the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, demonstrating the high level of coordination that now exists within the 40-member tactics committee of the opposition, representing all factions. Frankly, they moved into the caucus room to have their tactics meeting in the morning!In terms of the matters raised by the member for Aston, and the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would just draw the attention of those opposite to this statement by the Leader of the Opposition about our contributions to international monetary authorities. In relation to the G20, on 3 April he said:The biggest thing they've done, overwhelmingly the most important thing they've done, is agreed to commit about a trillion dollars to the International Monetary Fund collectively; now that's a good measure _So says the Leader of the Liberal Party. It was obviously not quite cross-referenced with the member for Aston's question before or with some of the other things that have been said recently. I would suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as she seeks to take potshots at the budget that has been delivered by the government, that she reflect on her friend and party colleague the Western Australian Premier, who said that his government welcomed fundamentally the contribution to the state of Western Australia by this Australian Labor government, that the Western Australian government has secured funding for deep-sea ports and industrial sites and that those projects could now go ahead. It was, from the perspective of the Western Australian Liberal government, a first-class budget, helping the development of Western Australia. I think the honourable member should consult with her party colleagues.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question and his active pursuit of infrastructure for the area north of Brisbane that he represents. On the front page of the Australian today there was an article and a photo of Mr Wayne Sachs, a Queensland ambulance officer who came to my office on 24 February to make a case. He came as someone who has witnessed the fact that there have been 13 fatalities on the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway since 2002. Mr Sachs put forward his personal experience of what it was like to literally see people expire after they have been through these accidents.This section of the Bruce Highway was not included on the Infrastructure Australia priority list. It was a pipeline project. It was not included because, in terms of the rigorous economic analysis that Infrastructure Australia undertook of projects that were submitted, it did not have the requisite amount of freight and passenger transport. But there was absolutely no doubt about this. Whilst it might not have met the economic test, it met the common-sense test, it met the decency test and it met the Australian test - which is about making sure that the national interest is looked after. So, in this budget, in spite of the pressures that are on due to the global economic recession, we made room to provide funds - not from the BAF - for this vital project. There was some $488 million from the Commonwealth and $125 million contributed from Queensland, because we knew that we needed to listen not just to economists but to people out there doing work in communities. And this is a government that will listen and will act. Supporting this project, which will support up to 650 jobs, will be good for the economy and good for safety.One wonders why this neglect happened over such a long period of time. Indeed, one wonders why, given that the shadow minister for transport, who is the local member for Wide Bay - this road is in his electorate - was reported in the same article as 'travelling the highway regularly, with his heart in his mouth'. He is quoted as saying:I'm always pleased when I turn off. You never feel completely safe on that road.And the shadow minister for transport is on the record as saying that this is a dreadfully accident-prone section that is rated as the worst piece of highway in Australia. That is what the shadow minister for transport said. He sat in this parliament in government for 12 years - with 10 years as a minister and a period as the minister for transport - but nothing was done over that long period of time.I wondered why nothing had been done over that period of time so I went back and had a look at what the opposition did in government and at what they allocated in budgets - not at what they said during election campaigns but at what they actually did when it came to nation-building infrastructure. In the Department of Transport and Regional Services budget statements in 2002-03, under the heading 'Federal government keeps Queensland moving', made by the Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the National Party at the time and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, it stated in relation to the Cooroy-Gympie route study that the government would establish a $1 million study that would 'examine possible future routes for the Bruce Highway'. But then they said - and these are in their budget papers - 'Construction is likely to be 15 or 20 years away.'No action was taken by the former government and yet a campaign was run demanding action by this government. Well, this government have listened to the community. That is why we have provided this funding. It has taken a Labor government to build this important infrastructure project in safe National Party territory because the government is determined to build the infrastructure that Australia needs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In terms of the printing processes for the budget, I am completely unaware as to how that was handled and I would imagine that if you had asked that question of Mr Howard he would have been unaware of the printing processes associated with the budget as well. It is a complex physical process; it takes time and I am sure there are corrections made on the way through, as there were in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. I know that, along with many members in this House, she is particularly pleased about the investments that were made in health in the budget. The Midland community in her electorate will benefit from a $180 million new hospital, which is being funded by the Commonwealth, and I am sure that she, along with others who have received funding in 32 different communities from the Health and Hospitals Fund, will welcome the investments that we are making. This week's budget continues to deliver on our commitments to reform and improve the health system across the country. We are investing in the whole health system across the whole country to deliver better health outcomes for Australians.Tuesday's nation-building recovery budget continues a journey in health that we began last year. Despite the major challenges to the budget caused by the global recession we have continued to drive major improvements in hospitals, health infrastructure, our health workforce, maternity services and services in rural and regional communities. It might be of interest to the House to know that this budget delivers a landmark $64 billion into our healthcare agreement. That is a 50 per cent increase on the investments made by the previous government, with 35 per cent more GP training places than we had under the previous government, a 45 per cent increase in rural health funding and a 57 per cent increase in Indigenous health funding. Nurses and midwives are also big winners from the budget. For the first time highly skilled nurse practitioners and midwives will be able to access the MBS and the PBS. In fact, the Australian College of Nurse Practitioners described this initiative as a 'visionary decision', while the Australian Nursing Federation said:Australians will be healthier and have greater access to equitable, quality health care because of changes announced in the Federal Budget _The rural package means that nearly 2½ thousand more doctors and 500 more communities are newly eligible for funding and 40 new projects to better support rural health services have been approved. Once again the government is taking action to make up for 11 years of neglect by the previous government. As I have already mentioned in answer to the member for Hasluck's question, this budget itemised the first down payments from the Health and Hospitals Fund, set up by this government to make long-term investments in our nation's health infrastructure. The fund is now in business and $3.2 billion worth of projects - with 32 projects across the country - have been given the green light.I do wonder whether the member for Herbert, who does not appear to be in the House today, supports the $250 million to expand the Townsville hospital or whether he thinks, as it appears some of the leadership does, that these sorts of investments are irresponsible. Likewise I would be interested to hear whether the member for Tangney and other members from Western Australia support the replacement of the Perth rehabilitation unit at the new Fiona Stanley Hospital. This project has now been made a reality, thanks to a $255 million contribution from the Commonwealth. - But we have heard nothing to indicate whether those opposite are going to support this project. That was an interesting interjection from the member at the front, who always manages to get things just a little wrong. He thinks this was an announcement already made by the previous government. I hate to break it to him: there was no health and hospitals fund from the previous government. There was no funding for hospital infrastructure by the previous government. - There was no money announced ever by the previous government for these projects. It has been welcomed already by the Liberals in Western Australia. But, no, those opposite are never prepared to acknowledge when these projects are being funded by us. They have a question to ask the Leader of the Opposition: are they going to stand up and support these initiatives in communities that need them or are they just going to be opportunistic and oppose anything that our government does, no matter how many communities will benefit? Most of these 32 projects are shovel ready, so, in addition to the obvious healthcare benefits, they will support jobs today and provide the infrastructure that Australia needs in its health system for tomorrow. As you know, Treasury modelling shows that up to 210,000 Australians would be out of work if it were not for our stimulus and our budget.I would like to read some comments that Mr John Kirwan, the Chief Executive Officer of the Launceston General Hospital, made about the investment of $40 million to upgrade his hospital. I know the member for Bass will be interested in this. I do want to quote, Mr Speaker, but I am not entirely sure all of the language is completely parliamentary. Mr Kirwan said:It's absolutely, bloody fantastic. There won't be many unemployed tradesmen around for the next few years.This is a fair budget. It is investing in health infrastructure across the country. Communities will benefit, and those opposite will have to decide whether they want to stand with their communities or stand with their leader.</DOC>

 - The government has outlined its fiscal strategy for the four years ahead. We have clearly outlined our program of economic stimulus, in particular our nation-building projects for recovery. We did that for one reason and one reason only: we are in the middle of a global recession that is threatening the employment of tens of thousands of Australians, threatening the viability of communities and threatening the jobs of very many people. We have moved entirely for the right reasons: to stimulate our economy and to protect our people from a vicious global recession. We have done that entirely appropriately and in a responsible way.Our fiscal stimulus has been assessed by the OECD as being one of the best and most responsible in the OECD. But this budget is not just about the here and now. This budget is about the future. It is a budget about building the wealth creation potential of the Australian economy through investing in infrastructure, skills, higher education and our people. It is a budget that is about preparing this country for a time when global growth returns. It is a budget which is about maximising the opportunities for this country when global growth returns, and to do that we do have to borrow on a temporary basis.It is also the responsible course of action for us to put in place a path back to surplus. What should never be forgotten is that there is more room to move in this country than in many other developed countries. Using the strength of our balance sheet to protect our people is entirely the responsible thing to do in these very difficult circumstances. As global growth does return, we will pay down debt, move the budget back to surplus and bring into play our medium-term fiscal rules - and they are tough. A two per cent cap on spending once growth comes back to trend is a very important fiscal discipline put in place by me and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation back in February and implemented in detail in this budget. You can see the stimulus wind down in the forward estimates. In the final year of the forward estimates there is no new net spend because what we have done, principally, is to borrow to make up for the $210 billion which has been lost to this country because of the global recession.That is the responsible thing to do. But, of course, those opposite have simply become totally irresponsible and totally out of touch. They are just so remote and removed from the problems in the Australian economy, if you judge them by what they have had to say in this House about the nature of the challenge that we face in this country. There is no understanding of it whatsoever in their public statements.I have always had a degree of respect for the Leader of the Opposition. I have always thought he was a reasonably bright bloke. And I always thought that he had some contacts with the business community that might help him get in touch with what was going on in the economy. But he is so out of touch that he does not understand the most basic fact of business life: if business is going to be successful and profitable it needs demand. When you have a global recession and the withdrawal of private capital, that gap can only be met up by a government borrowing responsibly. That is what we have been doing, and in so doing we have had the support of the business community.We have had the support of the business community because we have acted responsibly. Part of acting responsibly is bringing the budget back to surplus when global growth returns and paying down debt, thereby ensuring that we have protected our community at this time of global threat. But those opposite have no notion of that at all. They have become so opportunistic - they have become so rank in their approach to politics - that they have come in here today and played the race card as well. It is unbelievable! Their behaviour in the House this week means that they are absolutely and completely unfit for government.</DOC>

 - I would particularly like to thank the member for Bass for her question on paid parental leave. She has been a great activist for some time for parents to get access to this very important scheme. Today is a very significant day. I just say to the Treasurer that Tuesday night was a very significant occasion for Australian parents. It was a very significant day for Australian parents. For the first time Australia is going to have a paid parental leave scheme. Australian parents will mark this day as a crucial day in our history. It means that for the first time Australian parents will be able to stay home with their newborn babies full time - to spend time with their babies in those early months of a little child's life. It will give parents the options that they have been looking for so that they can better balance their work and family lives. Of course, it will also help to prepare Australia for the ageing population by encouraging more women to stay connected to their workplaces.The scheme will provide 18 weeks of parental leave at the federal minimum wage, which is currently around $543 a week. This is a long-overdue reform and means that Australia will finally catch up with the rest of the developed world. The scheme will commence on 1 January 2011 to give employers, in particular, time to prepare. Parents can choose between receiving the paid parental leave arrangements or the baby bonus and family tax benefit part B, depending on what suits their particular circumstances. Mothers who are not in the workforce will continue to be eligible for the baby bonus and family tax benefits part A and part B. I am pleased to say to the House that many employers and their organisations have welcomed this historic announcement. I will quote just a few. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said:What this scheme means is that life is going to be easier for a lot of people.Western Australia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:This would improve workforce participation _The Aldi Group - just to name one employer - said:Our employees are our greatest asset and an additional cash boost from the government on top of what we already offer will be a great help to new parents.This measure - this major reform in this year's budget - will help to prepare Australia for the future. I am pleased to note that those opposite have finally worked out that Australia does need this sort of strong action - a new paid parental leave scheme - to deal with the ageing of our population. I have already mentioned one contribution form the member for Warringah. He has certainly been out and about recently, but this latest admission from the member for Warringah was rather breathtaking. He said this week, just after we announced the paid parental leave scheme, that the former government did not do enough to support new parents. The member for Warringah said on Tuesday:But I have to say that on this issue I do think that the former government could have done more, should have gone further.Australian families could not agree more.</DOC>

 - You can tell when we are getting down to the end of question time: those opposite are so well prepared that the member for North Sydney has had to run the last two off the cuff, with no preparation by the tactics committee! You can understand that if you have a tactics committee of 40 you cannot get agreement. Secondly, I say to those opposite, particularly the member for North Sydney, whom I have known for some years, that his performance in question time today on the question of debt has been remarkable. He decided again to, shall we say, 'stray from the thematic' - which was about net debt - and open up what was from our point of view a welcome debate on foreign debt, given the unique contribution to foreign debt by the former Treasurer Mr Costello, who will soon be the Leader of the Opposition.Leave not granted. - What we are engaged in in this debate, in this parliament and in other parliaments and other governments right across the world, is a fundamentally serious challenge: how do you deal with the global recession? And there has been a complete abandonment of truth on the part of those opposite in any real debate or exchange about what you do. In fact, what is going on here is one huge smokescreen. The smokescreen led by the member for North Sydney, led by the member for Higgins before he moves up the front here, led by the Leader of the Opposition, is that those opposite would not engage in temporary borrowing and temporary deficit and temporary debt in the face of this recession. That is what they are actually arguing. That is the pretence which exists on the part of those opposite. Everybody knows in this country, all those who follow the economic debate in this country know, that those opposite are simply trading in an absolute falsehood, an absolute pretence. It is completely disconnected from reality. It is as if they are engaging in one huge bubble-like activity here in Canberra, unconnected with what is going on in the real economy, with real families, with real communities and with other countries around the world.Even on this question - that is, the reality of net debt and how to deal with it over time - we had the member for North Sydney go out there yesterday into no-man's-land, and what did he do? He confirmed the Liberal Party's debt position is $275 billion. The member for North Sydney said it would be $25 billion less. He confirmed therefore it is a $275 billion debt strategy by the Liberal Party. Yet they will seek to come in here tonight through the Leader of the Opposition and pretend that it is not like that.I would say to those opposite that, given the gravity of the challenges faced by the nation and by those facing unemployment today, it is about time we had a bit of truth in this debate, a bit of honesty on the part of those opposite. If the Leader of the Opposition is being honest about the proposition put forward, that he does not support the level of debt and the level of deficit which the government has advanced in the budget papers, he has one responsibility, and that is to name his debt target, to name the savings that he would make as well and, through that, to demonstrate how in fact it is different from what the member for North Sydney said yesterday. It is a very simple and straightforward challenge. If he fails to do that, he sinks a stake through the heart of his own credibility and through this extraordinary fear campaign on debt which is being mounted by those opposite, because in their heads - and, I dare say, in the hearts of those on the other side of the chamber who are a little bit honest - they know it to be an absolute falsehood as well.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Werriwa for his question. He is very well aware that first home buyer activity in his own electorate has been very strong since the introduction of the first home owner boost. He has told me about it. In fact, one of the Landcom developments out his way, One Minto, had to release extra land to cope with the extra demand that they have seen from first home buyers in the electorate of Werriwa.On Tuesday the Treasurer announced the government will extend the highly successful first home owner boost as part of our commitment to building the nation for recovery. The first home owner boost was introduced as a temporary stimulus measure to support housing construction and also to help young Australians into homes of their own. It has been very successful in supporting jobs. In fact, it has been one of the very important measures in both the stimulus packages and in the budget that will help support 210,000 fewer Australians ending up on the unemployment queues.To the end of March this year, 59,000 Australians have claimed the boost and, of course, many more have bought homes. Many more have signed contracts to build homes and will claim the boost once their homes are complete. There were 17,700 new loans written to first home buyers in March, compared with 8,800 in August 2008, so we see almost a doubling in the number of loans written to first home buyers. Loans for construction rose by almost 14 per cent in March, compared with in the previous month. That means that, in seasonally adjusted terms, housing loans have risen for six consecutive months, following eight months of decline prior to the introduction of the first home owner boost. The proportion of first home buyers is at record levels: over 27 per cent of new loans written are going to first home buyers. Building approvals have risen for the previous three months, after a major decline last year.In order to ensure the responsible phasing-out of the first home owner boost, it will be continued at existing levels for three months and then stepped down. So, until 30 September, first home buyers will be eligible for $21,000 from the federal government for newly built homes and $14,000 for existing homes. Between 1 October and the end of the year, 31 December, first home buyers will be eligible for $14,000 on newly constructed homes and $10,500 on existing homes.The reaction from people in the housing construction area and related fields has been, predictably, enormously positive. They know how important this measure is to support jobs in their industries. David Airey, the new President of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, says that this measure will have:_ tremendous flow-on effects _ to those in the business of servicing the property industry, such as solicitors, conveyancers, financiers, valuers, removalists, furniture suppliers and a range of tradespeople.Ron Silberberg of the Housing Industry Association says that this measure:_ means thousands of jobs will be secure and frenetic buying will be avoided. The proposal provides a transition to the cutting in of the investment in housing under the Nation Building Plan.Caryn Kakas, the Executive Director of the Residential Development Council, says:The timing for the boost to wrap up dovetails well into the ramp up of Government spending on the public housing front which will guarantee that jobs across the construction sector are secure.And Wilhelm Harnisch from Master Builders Australia says:_ these measures will be effective in lifting activity in the building and construction industry at a time when the global financial crisis is having its worst impacts _The first home owner boost is supporting the jobs of today and helping thousands of Australians into homes of their own - homes that will give them lifelong financial, social and emotional benefits. The Australian government is supporting the jobs of today by helping Australians into homes of their own.</DOC>

 - They have certainly run out of questions, Mr Speaker. They are now asking me to deliver next year's budget today! It is just extraordinary. It is absolutely extraordinary. But the member for North Sydney does correctly point to our commitment to put a spending cap on once growth returns to trend. He correctly points to it. I was talking about it before. It is the fiscal rule that we will operate by, and we put it out there for a very good reason. We do not apologise for providing funding to the Defence Force, for giving them certainty and for meeting our election commitments to fund the Defence Force. We do not apologise for the white paper.

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for the question and for his strong engagement with the farmers in his electorate. The budget, as it has been described, is about nation building for recovery. It is about supporting jobs today by building the infrastructure Australia needs for the future. It is also about tough savings to deliver the lowest net debt of all major advanced economies. And there are savings within the department of agriculture; there is no doubt about that, and the government has been upfront about that.I was interested to hear among the interjections that came from the member for Murray that she asked why we got rid of the dairy money that was there, when the only way of keeping that was to continue to charge consumers 11c a litre every time they wanted milk. If it is the position of the opposition that that should be brought back in, that 11c a litre should continue on milk, then perhaps we will hear that in the speech tonight. It clearly has support from one of the rural members of the Liberal Party.But what was more extraordinary was the claim from the National Party that there had been a $1 billion cut - a $1 billion cut - to agriculture, fisheries and forestry. Now, there have been cuts, and those cuts are real: $13 million from Land and Water Australia, a $3 million reduction in the rural issues program from the Rural Industries RDC and a $3.4 million reduction in funding for DAFF. But only the National Party could say $13 million plus $3 million plus $3.4 million equals $1 billion! National Party mathematics have created this extraordinary situation where they can get those figures and then run around regional radio across the country claiming that there have been $1 billion in cuts. It is not surprising they have come up with their own form of mathematics; they are only used to counting to nine in this room! We then also had the shadow minister for agriculture describing it as -  - And, if it is a position of the opposition that they are irrelevant to farmers, then they can say that tonight too. The shadow minister for agriculture put out the position that this was a 'horror budget' for agriculture. He always makes a thing about his background with the New South Wales Farmers Association, so I thought: well, what did the New South Wales Farmers Association say about the budget in their media release? 'Budget winners: infrastructure, water and drought assistance'. That was the headline on their media release, which I am very happy to table. I am very happy to table that, Mr Speaker.The National Party have developed this concept of the bush where they just go looking for gloom - looking for gloom and looking for misery wherever they can find it. We saw it earlier with the question that was asked by the Leader of the Nationals, where he complained about the method of forward estimates on drought funding when it is identical to how it was done when he was the minister for agriculture. At first I thought, 'How outrageous for him to do that; he would have known.' Then I thought: 'Well, he's the leader of the Nats; maybe he never knew. Maybe he never understood that that's how they work it.' The way they go around looking for gloom, it is like they have become the political equivalent of the bogong moth that just wants to hug the mozzie zapper. They just want to keep going out there and looking to the most miserable stories they can find.But we have a budget that is good to the bush. We have a budget that delivers infrastructure nationwide, that is community based and that goes all the way down to the farm - infrastructure for roads, rail, ports and broadband, all of it bringing farmers closer to their markets and closer to each other. There is community based infrastructure through local councils and local schools supporting rural communities, support for rural health including incentives to get GPs to the bush and infrastructure all the way back to the farm. There is the $300 million to provide on-farm irrigation - infrastructure on the farm. There is the increase in the small business tax break from 30 per cent to 50 per cent so that farmers can make their own choices about their own infrastructure on-farm.The opposition need to detail which of these programs they would cut, which savings they would make or which measures they would abandon. We have got no idea what their direction is going to be on this, given the Leader of the Opposition has only asked four questions since budget night, keeping him off TV during that time. How long would it be since a Leader of the Opposition has asked so few questions following the budget? I thought it might be decades, but it was pretty similar to what we saw from Brendan towards the end.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. On the question of gross debt, as I indicated in many interviews last week, gross debt peaks at around $300 billion; secondly, net debt peaks at around $200 billion; and, thirdly, I have said repeatedly that net debt rises to about 13.8 per cent of GDP, which to the chagrin of those opposite is the lowest net debt of all the major advanced economies. In fact this is about one-seventh that of the other major advanced economies. What I find remarkable in the debate which the Leader of the Opposition has engaged in on this matter over the last week and beyond is that it does reflect a general strategy on the part of those opposite which is this: they will stop at nothing to talk the economy down. This government have embraced a nation-building strategy for recovery; those opposite are engaged in talking the economy down. The government are in the business of building the economy up; those opposite are in the business of talking the economy down. The reason why we have a positive strategy and they have a negative strategy is that we are acting in the national interest and they are acting in their political interest. The contrast is absolutely clear.So I would suggest to those opposite that, when they are confronted with developments out there in the economy which actually suggest that Australia is doing better than other economies in the midst of the worst recession in three-quarters of a century, it would be useful if they began talking positively about the economy as well, rather than engaging in one permanent negative diatribe about what is going on out there. The net impact of talking the economy down is to in fact have an effect on confidence and, if you have that effect on confidence, that has an effect on real economic performance. So the contrast is clear for all to see. We stand for a positive strategy, and those opposite are for a negative strategy. We stand for talking the economy up; you stand for talking the economy down. The contrast is clear for all to see.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for her question because it goes to building the economy up in the part of Brisbane that she represents. The government is seeking to build the economy up in the electorates of all members in this place, even though a large slice of them chose to vote against these measures. Let us take the electorate of Bonner, which the honourable member represents. The government's Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan is currently supporting 103 projects in the electorate of Bonner - a $29.9 million investment in the honourable member's electorate. This includes 101 projects under the Building the Education Revolution program, the single largest school modernisation program in Australia's history. It also includes black spot projects right across the country - in the case of the electorate of Bonner and Brisbane, a $1.25 million investment.These practical projects are the way in which we are building the economy up, while those opposite are embarked upon a strategy to talk the economy down. Right across the country, the government's nation building for recovery plan is about to launch 35,000 projects by year's end. Already in the case of rail and road, $135 million has been spent on the Hunter Valley to Newcastle rail track to transport coal - 150 jobs in the Hunter region. Already, work has begun on the line between Maroona and the South Australian border and the line between Albury and Seymour in Victoria, two rail projects worth 240 jobs. The first of 301,000 new concrete railway sleepers have been unloaded near Parkes for the Cootamundra to Parkes track upgrade. Work continues on the $164 million Midland Highway Brighton bypass project in Tasmania. The bypass and associated transport hub are expected to provide up to 380 jobs in Tasmania. That is simply in rail and road.In social housing, construction of the first new house built under the stimulus plan has now been completed. The house was built in 13 weeks with a total of 52 people involved in the building works, which also included three apprentices. Work has also commenced on site for 29 new housing construction projects in Tasmania, 45 construction projects in New South Wales and 42 new ones in Western Australia.In the National School Pride Program, where every school in the country is being allocated between $50,000 and $200,000 for maintenance and repairs, projects are beginning right across the nation. The Primary Schools for the 21st Century program has already commenced early work on more than 300 schools around Australia as part of round 1 of what will be the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history. Community infrastructure is being built, with 137 councils being funded to build and renew community infrastructure right across the country, including sporting infrastructure. In energy efficiency, 20,000 Australian homeowners have had ceiling insulation installed in their homes and more than 20,000 homeowners have installed a solar hot water system under the stimulus plan's energy efficiency program. These are the practical projects that are underway at present. This is what we are engaged in nationwide. This is practical work to build the economy up, not to tear the economy down.If you were wandering around the country last week and listening to what the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney were saying, you would have heard one diatribe of negativity. Every single interview was aimed at talking the economy down, talking confidence down and therefore talking the performance of our economy down. Our nation building for recovery plan is about building the economy up. We are supporting jobs, small business and apprenticeships today by investing in the infrastructure Australia needs for tomorrow. That is why we as the government have stepped in to fill the gap which has been left by the private sector in retreat. That is why we have invested nearly 70 per cent of the government's stimulus strategy in nation-building infrastructure. That is the strategy that we have embarked upon. Those opposite, however, are embarked upon a negative scare campaign on deficit and debt with a view to talking the economy down. We have a nation building for recovery plan. The government is proud of it. We are getting on with the business of making an impact on the global economic recession, a recession which is causing havoc across every economy in the world, and that is why Australia is doing better than most other economies in the world.</DOC>

 - I will start off by saying that the government absolutely welcomes this debate about deficit and debt - we certainly do. By the end of the forward estimates, net debt will be $188 billion or 13.6 per cent of GDP. By 2013-14, net debt will be $203 billion or 13.8 per cent of GDP. If he wants me to go on and talk about gross debt, I am happy to do that as well. In 2013-14 it will be $315 billion.These are matters that were raised by me in numerous interviews last week. Why were they raised and why are they relevant to questions in the House today? They are relevant because this country has had imposed on it a collapse of revenues by $210 billion over the forward estimates. That is why it is necessary for the government to borrow to support jobs, to support business and to support our economy at a time of national need because of the global recession.Those opposite continue to wander around Australia with the pretence that if they were in government they would not be borrowing right now. We all know that that is a falsehood; it is absurd. But those opposite will simply not fess up and admit that if they were in government now they would be borrowing every single dollar that we have had to borrow and they would not pay it off one day earlier than this government. But they want to, for their own political reasons, continue this farce that somehow if they were in government at the moment they would not have to borrow. The responsible thing to do for the Australian people to support employment and to support business is to borrow and then chart the course back to surplus, which is exactly what this government's budget does.We had a couple of outings from those opposite over the past week. First of all, at the end of last week we had the address-in-reply from the Leader of the Opposition. Then we had the shadow Treasurer wandering off to the Press Club for his traditional reply. There were three words that were not spoken in either of those speeches, and those three words were 'alternative fiscal policy'. There was no alternative fiscal policy put by the opposition in either of those two outings. Given the magnitude of the economic challenge faced by this country, this should not have been a normal reply from the opposition. Given their critique of the government, they had an obligation to put before the Australian people an alternative, and they did not. Fronting up to a budget reply in the middle of a global recession, whether it is the Leader of the Opposition or whether it is the shadow Treasurer, without an alternative fiscal policy is a bit like the jockey turning up to the Melbourne Cup without a horse.They stand absolutely naked in this debate. They pretend they have an alternative fiscal policy, but at the end of the day they will borrow every dollar this government has been forced to borrow and they will not pay it off one day earlier, given their lack of commitment and given their lack of guts. The one thing we do know is that they have not got the guts to chart the course back to surplus, like this government does, which is why we took the hard decisions in the budget to bring the budget back to surplus and to look after the long-term interests of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. Indeed, I note that through the government's Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan there are some 135 smaller infrastructure projects taking place in his electorate, costing some $54.4 million. Each of these projects is supporting local jobs, stimulating the local economy and leaving the electorate of Oxley and the greater Ipswich area an even better placed to live. This includes some 109 projects under the Building the Education Revolution plan, the biggest school modernisation plan in the nation's history. It includes two black spots projects at a cost of $1.4 million. It is worth noting with regard to these projects in Oxley that many of these projects are underway right now. If those opposite had their way, none of these projects would be proceeding - none of them.There is one big project underway as well that will affect the electorate of Oxley - as well as, of course, the electorate of Blair, the electorate of Moreton and other electorates in Brisbane - and that is the Ipswich Motorway. For the Ipswich Motorway upgrade, which was opposed by those opposite, $2.5 billion was provided by this side of parliament in order to ease urban traffic congestion in the western suburbs of Brisbane. The Prime Minister and I - with you, Member for Oxley, and the member for Blair and others - turned the first sod on 2 March 2008, just 14 months ago. We returned to where the works are taking place on the Friday after last sitting period, and there the people managing the site told us that 4,000 Australians had been inducted into the work on that site alone. That is 4,000 put to work building the nation, building the economic recovery. This project, of course, is all part of the N1, building a modern highway network from Melbourne all the way to Cairns, both through the main highways and through the feeder networks. There is also $2.6 billion into the Bruce Highway, double what the previous government contributed over 12 years, and for the Pacific Highway, $3.1 billion from this side of the House in six years against $1.3 billion from those opposite over 12 long years - and it runs through most of their electorates.Today I, along with the member for Riverina, attended the latest milestone in the duplication of the Hume: the opening of the new $78 million Sheahan Bridge duplication over the Murrumbidgee at Gundagai. That was two months ahead of schedule and on budget. In the December stimulus package we brought forward $490 million to accelerate work on the Tarcutta and Woomargama bypasses, bringing forward that work to create jobs now to make the Australian economy more productive. All of these plans were opposed by those opposite. We do need nation building for recovery. The government understands that and that is why we are getting on with the job of delivering it.</DOC>

 - As the honourable member will know, there is nothing inconsistent with what the Treasurer has said and what I have said before - none whatsoever. On the question of debt, though, I really enjoy the questions on the part of those opposite, because one of the matters which is relevant on debt is, of course, foreign debt, and foreign debt is something which those opposite seem to be very reluctant to discuss in this place. If we look carefully at what was -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. And of course, on the question of net debt, presumably the basis of the question being asked by those opposite is their concern about the overall assessment by international credit-rating agencies. I draw to the attention of those opposite, in their desperate attempt to talk the Australian economy down, that Standard and Poor's, the international rating agency, said just after the budget was released a week or so ago that Australia's AAA rating was reaffirmed. Those opposite then disappeared at a thousand miles an hour, realising that their core political attack in fact had no basis in substance whatsoever, because they knew that they were engaged in a negative scare campaign - a fear campaign with one objective, which was to talk the Australian economy down. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Therefore, on the question of net debt, the statement made before by the Treasurer and our public commentary on this has been consistent, and that is that net debt would peak out at around 200 and gross debt would peak out at about 300. That is what we have said consistently. For those opposite who are interested in it, they should find it so in the budget papers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. As the member knows, our Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan will deliver something like 80 projects in her electorate worth something like $34 million. Of this, there will be 63 school projects which are part of the biggest school modernisation program in our history. There will be 10 housing units. There will be seven black spot projects. There will be $8.9 million for community infrastructure. Of course, as the Prime Minister indicated before, if those opposite had their way not one of these 80 projects would be happening right now - not one happening to support local employment, not one happening to support local business, not one happening to support a local economy in the face of this global recession.Last week both the Prime Minister and I had the opportunity to move extensively around the country. I went to Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Darwin to talk to locals about what was going on in their communities and about what important infrastructure investments we were undertaking right across the nation. In Adelaide I spoke to Mr Ron Jenkins, who is the president of the Seaford District Residents Association in South Australia. As the member for Kingston knows, he had been calling for an extension of the Noarlunga to Seaford rail in South Australia for something like four years. Ron, I have to say, was pretty pleased with the government's commitment to $291 million to deliver critical public transport to a rapidly growing area. On the Sunshine Coast both the Prime Minister and I had the opportunity to talk to Mr Wayne Sachs, who is an ambulance officer in Gympie. Of course, he was pretty pleased with the government's decision of $488 million to duplicate the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway. He said to us that this would save very many lives. In Darwin, with the member for Solomon, I met with Mr Gary Fry, who is the principal of the Moulden Park Primary School in Darwin. He was pretty pleased with the funding that was coming through the National School Pride and Value in Action school projects, which were going to enhance the performance of his students.I think it is important that these local projects bring local communities together, because bringing communities together and bringing all Australians together is very important given the environment of this global recession. We are dealing with an event the likes of which we have not seen in 75 years, and it is critical that as the national government we take steps to stimulate local economies and, through those local economies, the national economy. Otherwise, the burden would fall fairly and squarely on families and small business. So our stimulus strategy has basically had three phases. The first phase was to move very quickly when this became apparent at the end of last year, and that was to direct cash to cash constrained people in the country. It was very important to get that out to those people last December to keep up retail sales over Christmas. It was very important to keep employment up over Christmas. It was very important to support small businesses during that time. That was very important in maintaining confidence in the Australian economy.Phase 2 is coming through now: 35,000 construction projects around the country, the likes of which members around here are out there supporting day in, day out. Of course, it is the case that there are some on that side of the House who are out there supporting them as well. They are champions for stimulus in their local communities, but they are pussycats when they come to this parliament. They are out there supporting these projects in the local community and voting against them in this House. I was at an event on the weekend where a state Liberal member of parliament gave the stimulus package his full support. He was not game to say anything else given there were 250 parents there at that school.But we are doing this for the best of reasons. It is not just about the education revolution, it is about supporting jobs, it is about supporting business and it is about supporting the Australian economy at a time of great need. That is why our three phases of economic stimulus have been very important.If we are meant to believe what those opposite say - that they do not really believe in borrowing - what is the logical consequence of that position? Because there has been a $210 billion collapse in revenues, to make up for that they would have to savagely increase taxes or savagely cut services. So which is it? Because if they are not going to do that they will borrow every cent that we are borrowing and they will not pay it back one day earlier.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. I also thank her for the opportunity I had recently to visit Blackmans Bay Primary School in her electorate, where I announced the successful Tasmanian primary schools for the first round of Primary Schools for the 21st Century under the Building the Education Revolution program. I know that the member for Franklin, as a member who is in touch with her local community, is delighted that 50 schools in her electorate have already been allocated $31.9 million for 62 projects as part of Building the Education Revolution.These benefits for local schools and for local jobs in the electorate of Franklin are examples of what is happening right around the country. As members on this side of the House are clearly aware, the biggest school modernisation program in this nation's history is the single biggest part of the government's $42 billion economic stimulus strategy, our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. It is a plan that is all about supporting jobs today while we build the infrastructure we need for tomorrow in almost 10,000 schools right around the country.Already the government has announced rounds 1 and 2 of the National School Pride Program, totalling $1.3 billion, which has already been allocated to 9,490 eligible primary and secondary schools around the country for 13,176 projects. And many of these projects have already started, meaning that schools around the country are a hive of activity, supporting local jobs and supporting local tradies.In addition, I have announced the first 1,499 primary schools that will receive up to $3 million each through round 1 of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. This will total 2,010 projects approved at a value of $2.83 billion.So with just these two programs to date the Rudd government is supporting 15,186 projects and injecting $4.13 billion of construction activity into our economy. This has been well received by those who care about education. I take you to a letter I received from Maria Hardy, the Principal of Bondi Beach Public School. -  - Yes, where is Bondi Beach Public School, I wonder? She wrote to me on 8 May and said:I write on behalf of all staff, students, parents and carers of Bondi Beach Public School to thank you for the funding received under the National School Pride program. The submission process involved wide community consultation and we are very happy that our efforts have been rewarded.Unfortunately, the Principal of the Bondi Beach Public School was not able to write on behalf of her local federal member, the Leader of the Opposition, who opposed every dollar of investment in that school.But what is and has been amazing about recent days regarding the Building the Education Revolution program is the orgy of opportunism coming from those opposite, who, urged on by the member for Higgins, come to Canberra and rush into the parliament to vote against Building the Education Revolution and then, in their local electorates, cannot wait to be associated with it. I am glad that the member for Franklin asked me this question because I think she would be a bit amazed to know that Senator Abetz - some mothers do have them - appears to be trying to take credit for a program that he opposes. Senator Abetz sent an email to my office seeking a list, in Excel format, of the names of the principals and the addresses of the schools that have been successful so that he could send letters of congratulations to them. He votes against it in the Senate and then wants me to give him the list of names and addresses so that he can send letters of congratulations!If only it was just Senator Abetz. But, of course, the member for Menzies got himself into the act by writing to me and expressing his disappointment that he only got the list of the successful schools in his electorate under the National School Pride Program a day before they were in his local newspapers. The question for the member for Menzies is: is he such an honest man that he is disappointed he did not get a press release out to his local newspapers in time to say that he opposed every dollar of that expenditure, or is he disappointed that he did not get an opportunity to fully associate himself with a program that he opposes? While the orgy of opportunism continues amongst those opposite - out in their electorates pretending they support the stimulus, here sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition voting against the biggest school modernisation program the nation has ever seen - we will be getting on with building those schools, supporting jobs today and the infrastructure we need for tomorrow.</DOC>

 - On the question of GDP and 2020, I do not have that number with me. On the question of net debt as a figure, it would be about 75 billion. I also draw the honourable member's attention to the following: these figures represent, on Australia's part, a net debt performance that is the lowest of all the major advanced economies. I would say to the honourable member opposite that when net debt peaks for Australia at 13.8 per cent of GDP, the average for the major advanced economies is 88.7 per cent of GDP: for Japan, 131 per cent of GDP; for the United Kingdom, 80; for the United States, 80; Canada, 28; France, 79; Germany, 84; Italy, 125. Then we go to the rest of the economies. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. We know that the member for Dickson has such a strong and personal relationship with the Leader of the Opposition. That is why he seems to figure so prominently in question time. Mind you, given his performance last week on private health insurance and public hospitals, it is no wonder why. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The uncomfortable news for those opposite is that net deficit and net debt for this country compare well against the rest of the world. On the question of net debt, I would simply re-emphasise this point: when our net debt peaks at 13.8 per cent of GDP, as projected in the budget papers, it represents not just the lowest of the other major advanced economies, it is something like seven times lower. That means that when we peak at 13.8, that across the G7 will be 88.7. I heard an interjection before in relation to the other advanced economies. The average across the other advanced economies is, I am advised, 79.1. Therefore, for Australia, taking such a responsible approach to stepping in to make a difference with Australian economic performance now in the midst of a global recession is the responsible course of action. - I welcome the interjection by the member for O'Connor. I was in Western Australia last week and I was with the WA Premier, who was supporting this government's investment in nation building, supporting this government's investment in the Oakajee port development, supporting this government's investment in the Northbridge link in the middle of the city of Perth, supporting this government's investment in a range of infrastructure projects. It seems that at that stage the government was engaged in the business of building the economy up. The only contribution the Leader of the Opposition seemed to be making in Perth last week was a dubious contribution to retail sales in a particular supermarket outlet, where he was not entertained for an extraordinarily long period of time.On the question of net debt, the government's position is that 13.8 per cent of GDP is the lowest of the other major advanced economies by a country mile. This entire strategy on the part of those opposite rests on an absolute lie and the Leader of the Opposition knows that fact. That is what this is about. He knows that taxation revenues have collapsed $210 billion at a time when -  - Mr Speaker, to assist the House, I do so. The absolute untruth upon which the opposition's strategy is based is this: they know that there has been a $210 billion collapse in taxation revenue. I contrast that with the $334 billion taxation windfall which the member for Higgins received when he was Treasurer, courtesy of the resources boom. That is fact 1. Fact 2 is that, as the member for North Sydney blurted out in a stream of consciousness last week or the week before, their overall borrowings would be $25 billion less than the government's. If you net that -  - He intervenes and interjects now: 'At least.' The Leader of the Opposition is so well served by the member for North Sydney. They have committed themselves therefore to a gross debt of $300 billion or thereabouts, minus $25 billion. That is their position. That is the second lie upon which the entire strategy on the part of those opposite -  -  - the second untruth upon which this entire strategy has been constructed. - Mr Speaker, I will withdraw to assist you. - It seems that those who are, shall we say, casual in their relationship with the truth are very sensitive when it comes to being pinged for being so casual in that relationship with the truth.Of course, then we have the third element of their strategy. Firstly, they know there has been a $210 billion revenue collapse; secondly, they themselves admit through that great voice of reason on their part, the member for North Sydney, that their total debt would be $25 billion less than the government's; thirdly, as the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister for infrastructure have said today, they then show up out on the ground and participate in the launching of infrastructure projects across the country because they want to be part of the local action. This I think also goes to the heart of the truthfulness of the strategy being embraced by those opposite.But here it is in a nutshell: they have embarked upon a strategy to talk the economy down. That is their strategy - to talk the Australian economy down and to create a greater problem than would otherwise be the case. - The government's strategy is one of nation building for recovery, and we are in the business of doing that with our sleeves rolled up right across the country. We were in Western Australia last week with a Liberal Premier doing exactly that. In fact, I seem to recall the member for Curtin showed up at one project associated with that. Maybe I am mistaken as to where the money came from for that particular project.Can I say to those opposite that this is the practical response to and what you do in the face of a global recession which is the worst economic downturn in three-quarters of a century. The alternatives are these: you stand back and do nothing, or you embrace the government's strategy, which is this. When there is a huge assault on private sector activity in the economy, the government steps in temporarily to make a difference. That is what we have done. That is why we are investing in infrastructure. That is why more than 70 per cent of the government's stimulus package is investing in infrastructure. That is why we are engaged in rail, road and ports right across the country. That is why we are investing in social housing right across the country - to make a difference, to reduce the impact. What those opposite in their hard of hats say is, 'Let the free market rip.'Opposition members - Hard of hats!An opposition member - You've got hard-hats on the brain! - Heart of hearts. I think those opposite are also challenged in terms of their hearing. What those opposite say in their heart of hearts, to the extent that they have one, is as follows. The ultimate position of those opposite seems to be: 'Let the free market rip. Don't intervene, and therefore throw another 200,000 people onto the unemployment queues.' That is the position which you have, unless we accept what the member for North Sydney said last week at absolute face value. Joe, I have known you for a long time; I can only take it for what it is. You would simply borrow $25 billion less. This entire strategy is based on an absolute falsehood. You know it. But its sinister political objective is this: to talk the economy down.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. Indeed, it was a pleasure to visit Kyneton with the member for Bendigo to announce the $5 million for the sports facility in Kyneton - a campaign that had been conducted for 10 years by that local community. It is a project that will support local jobs, stimulate the local economy and make a big difference to young people in Kyneton in particular and for generations to come. We know that local capital works are a very effective way of stimulating the economy when it is needed most. That is why we have delivered $800 million through the regional and local Community Infrastructure Program.More than 3,300 projects have been approved in local communities right across Australia, regardless of the electorate. An analysis of that $800 million shows that 53 per cent is going to government-held seats, Labor-held seats - that is slightly less than the percentage of seats we hold in the parliament, which is 55 per cent - and 41 per cent is going to Liberal and National party seats such as Sturt. Every seat in the parliament will benefit. Indeed, six per cent of that funding is going to Independent-held seats. There is a particular bias towards electorates affected by bushfire or flood. Hence the electorates of McEwen and, in particular, Kennedy have benefited substantially from this program. This contrasts with the previous government's approach, whereby one-third of the funds under the Regional Partnerships program went into just 10 seats - and every single one of them was held by the Liberal Party or the National Party.Our program is a part of the 70 per cent of the stimulus package that is going into infrastructure. But we know that, in spite of the fact that this is a program that is being fairly delivered across the country, those opposite voted against funding for their own electorates. Here in Canberra they did doorstops and called it 'low-quality spending'. But when they visited their electorates it was a very different story. There is an old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words, and that is certainly true when it comes to this program. Here is a photo of the member for Swan, on 1 May, pointing at plans for a new civic centre and library in South Perth, to which we are contributing $2 million. I do not think he is saying to the mayor and the local community leaders, 'This is a project I voted against.' - The opposition are embarrassed by this because what they are doing in their electorates is different from what they are doing in here. It is important that the people who are listening to this know exactly what they are doing in their electorates. Here is a photo of the member for Grey at the announcement of the funding for the Port Pirie library and internet centre on 1 May. The member for Mayo is pushing his way into the photograph. He did not want to miss out on being in the local paper. He was happy to welcome the $2.3 million for the new swimming pool in Strathalbyn. He was very happy to see that. Here is a photo of the member for Gilmore giving the thumbs up to the program with Senator Mark Arbib. They will not put their hands up in here, but they put their thumbs up in their electorates and pretend that they support these programs. The Dunn and Lewis youth complex in Ulladulla is a good project. The opposition were happy to vote against it in the parliament, but they go back to their electorates and pretend that they are for it. They stand up here in question time and say, 'What about the debt and all of this?' You cannot say that you are against the spending here and then go back to your electorate and campaign for it. It is just not fair dinkum.From time to time we see people who are not fair dinkum but are prepared to parade themselves before the media. Indeed, last week Claire Werbeloff shot to international fame after going to extraordinary lengths to get herself in front of the camera to give a grab and to get that few minutes of fame. But, unfortunately, when you look for the substance it just is not there. That is just like the Leader of the Opposition, who voted against the Community Infrastructure Program. One of the first projects launched was a terrific project to fix up the Waverley pavilion. I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition and suggested that he might like to come along. You would think that, out a sense of doing the right thing, he would be too embarrassed to come along. - But there was no element of embarrassment from the Leader of the Opposition. He was there faster than you can say, 'chk-chk boom!' He was there for the grab, for that few minutes of fame. And when he was there, this is what he said -  -  - Have a look behind you, Malcolm. Your colleagues have been saying for two weeks, 'I don't know why Malcolm turned up.' - I am talking about the Community Infrastructure Program, like other programs where they vote one way but say something else in their electorates. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition had this to say about the program that he voted against:I'm here to say _ good work Albo, good on you for putting the money into the Pavilion for the cricket club, we welcome it _Well, it would be nice if you voted for it - very simple. They welcome it in the electorate but vote against it in Canberra: opportunism writ large. - </DOC>

 - This sort of pick-a-box stuff is so typical and shows just how opportunistic those opposite are. The member for North Sydney knows very well the figure I referred to was beyond the forward estimates. He knows it very well. It is there for everybody to see. -  - It is there and he knows it. All this is is one giant camouflage for the fact that they have got no alternative fiscal policy, no alternative fiscal policy whatsoever, and no answers - no economic answers for this country when it faces its biggest economic challenge in 75 years. - And they are showing just how barren, how sterile, how devoid of ideas they are. This government have moved decisively. We have had three stages of fiscal stimulus which have been absolutely essential, given the growth contraction that has been imposed on us by the rest of the world. And we have acted on the best of advice. Could I just quote someone who is not known to be a rabid socialist; let us have a look at just what Mr Ben Bernanke has had to say about the type of action that this government have taken - why we are borrowing to support employment and to support businesses. This is what Ben Bernanke had to say in the US on 3 March:We are better off moving aggressively today to solve our economic problems; the alternative could be a prolonged episode of economic stagnation that would not only contribute to further deterioration in the fiscal situation, but would also imply lower output, employment, and incomes for an extended period.What we have done is everything within our power to support the employment of Australians and to support Australian businesses at this time of national economic threat. All we get from those opposite is this opportunistic approach because they are so devoid of any alternative ideas, so devoid of an alternative fiscal policy. They are so embarrassed by the fact that they have no alternative that we get this silly game-playing in this House and the pretence that they would not have to borrow to support this economy, given what has been imposed on this country by the rest of the world.We on this side of the House are proud of what we have done with our economic stimulus. Seventy per cent of it has been put into shovel-ready projects and infrastructure, supporting employment from one end of the country to the other. What are the opposition doing? They are going out into their electorates and supporting the projects then coming in here and opposing them. Surely that says everything about their lack of courage. It says everything about their lack of commitment. They do not have the courage of their convictions because all they are concerned about is opportunistic politics. They do not have the national interest in front of them; they have the self-interest of the Leader of the Opposition, who the minister for infrastructure has just proven is a monumental hypocrite and opportunist - and the rest of them stand condemned by their actions out there in the electorate, supporting these vital projects and jobs then coming into this House and opposing them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blaxland for his question. At last count there were over 140 separate projects underway in his electorate - tens of millions of dollars being spent in his local schools; on local black spots; with councils on priority community infrastructure projects, on small infrastructure and large infrastructure; and 60 units of social housing in the member's electorate, at a cost of $16.8 million. It is worth remembering two very important things: not one of these projects would have proceeded if the opposition had their way and not one of the jobs that these projects deliver would have proceeded if the opposition had their way. In fact, these projects, which are already underway, are supporting jobs today by building the infrastructure that we will need tomorrow.The government took early and decisive action through the economic stimulus packages, including by setting aside $6.4 billion for social housing, $400 million on repairs and maintenance, underway right across the country - and I have visited many of these marvellous projects, employing local tradespeople during much-needed work - but also building new housing. I was so excited on Saturday to visit the first house built under the stimulus package. It was terrific to go to Blaxland with the member and see a home that was built by Degree Constructions, a small building company headed by Bob Geybi. The site supervisor there, Adam Iacono, told me that 52 separate tradespeople had been on that site, and three apprentices, including one young apprentice who had been hired specifically in response to the social housing stimulus work that this company had picked up. Jack Tsoi was hired as an apprentice because of this work that Degree Constructions had got through the social housing stimulus package; and Nick Ferris and Aaron Ridolfi, two other apprentices, were there on the day as well. I had a lovely chat to them; they are terrific young men. Adam said that Degree Constructions was also building 15 units in Guildford and another freestanding house in Villawood as part of the stimulus package. He was terrifically pleased. He was saying not a lot of work was out there in the current circumstances, and they were very, very grateful for the work that was coming through the social housing stimulus package.But it is not just them. It is not just the builders and electricians and bricklayers and carpet layers and plasterers and tilers. It is also the people who supply those materials right across Australia where those materials are being manufactured.I was very fortunate to meet the Sada family, who will be moving into their home tomorrow. I think that Tuesday or Wednesday was going to be moving day for Mr and Mrs Sada and their three children, including 13-year-old Jonathan who has cerebral palsy. This home is perfect for the needs of their family. Jonathan has a room with a tiled floor. The hallways are wider and the walls are reinforced so that when he needs lifting equipment as he becomes older and larger and heavier, lifting equipment can be put in. There is a bathroom into which he can be wheeled more easily, and his mother and father will not have to break their backs lifting him in and out of the shower, as they were doing previously. This home is perfect for this family. It has got a 3,000-litre water tank. They are using the water for the toilets, the laundry and the gardens. It has got energy efficient appliances so that they will be saving on their electricity bills. It is a terrific story for the Sada family.It is also a terrific story for Degree Constructions and for the work that they provide and the work that they are doing with their own tradespeople, their subcontractors and the suppliers. It is good news all round to see the work that was supported through the nation-building economic stimulus plan by this side - though not by that side, mind you - providing homes for Australia's neediest people, and jobs. Jobs in construction are one of the biggest employers in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for one of his characteristically challengingly questions. I also note, by the way, for the honourable member asking this question, that part of the government's nation building for recovery program includes a $18 million investment in the Ironsley Bridge in the honourable member's electorate. I understand that it is a project which has been waiting some decades to be done. I understand that previous governments may have neglected to invest in that bridge. We are proud of the fact that we have done so. I am proud of the fact also that the minister for infrastructure has sought to intervene here. As I think he said himself, this particular proposal constituted an exception to the normal consideration of this matter, particularly given the impact which flooding has had on local communities over such a long period of time.On the broader question which the member asks, about clean energy - and he made a particular reference to a clean energy initiative - I am not familiar with its detail. However, if the initiative is well constructed and well deliberated on, then I am confident that both the minister for the environment and the minister for energy would be keen to examine it and to provide him with a direct response.On clean energy more broadly, I simply say this. Firstly, the government of course has embraced a renewable energy target for Australia. Secondly, the government has also in the budget allocated some $4.5 billion for investment in a range of clean energy proposals, one of which relates to how we advance clean coal technologies across Australia. The $2 billion-plus proposed investment in a range of clean coal technologies, both brown and black coal, against the raft of carbon capture and storage technologies is very important to the future of our coal industry. On the pure renewables side, our proposal to allocate some $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for investment in what the government hopes will be the largest solar energy project anywhere in the world, equivalent to 1,000 megawatts, is also worth backing.The third element of the government's clean energy strategy rests upon the other category of renewable energy projects. While the minister for energy is absent today, I am sure that he would not mind me saying that the response to his application for tender and applications of expressions of interest from the renewable energy sector in response to the government's $500 million renewable energy fund has been quite extraordinary. My recollection is that there are more than 60 projects put forward - small ones, and medium to large ones - and from memory the range goes from something like two megawatts to something like 200 megawatts across the entire raft of energy technologies, including solar, wind, wave, tidal, geothermal, as well as others. This is an important part also of Australian moving to a cleaner energy future.This is what the government are doing by way of direct investment or co-investment with businesses, including our largest coal companies down to our smallest renewable energy companies, in order to place Australia onto a more secure renewable energy footing for the future. Secondly, we are also seeking to do so by advancing our renewable energy target as well.I might just add one more point to the honourable member's question. Part and parcel of getting the price signals for this right, of course, is to seek early passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme through the parliament. This government have endorsed and ratified Kyoto. We have put forward a clear proposal as to how we intend to deal with this. We have obtained support from the three principal conservation organisations - the Climate Institute, the WWF, as well as the ACF. We have obtained support also from the BCA and from the AiG. We are therefore advancing this proposal -  -  - It is interesting that those opposite would again seek to launch attacks on industry organisations with whom from time to time they may politically disagree. But returning to the point about the CPRS, the government is proceeding with what is necessary for the nation to establish long-term predictability for the price of carbon and also to encourage the further development of the renewable energy sector in Australia. That is really important.Our strategy is clear. After listening to Senator Boswell today, I would like to know where those opposite stand on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They say that they are engaging the government in dialogue. The National Party said today that the government has no hope of obtaining any National Party support. I look forward to what leadership is provided by the Leader of the Liberal Party on this matter when the joint party room meets within the next 24 hours.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. The Rudd government has delivered more solar panels, more solar hot water systems and more support for solar power than at any time in our history. Part of that commitment was to deliver $150 million over five years for the Solar Homes and Communities Plan, but since the federal budget the government's commitment to solar homes and communities now totals close to $500 million. This support translates to the highest ever uptake of solar panels on Australian rooftops, ahead of the transition to the solar credits under the expanded renewable energy target. In February, the government boosted the solar hot water rebate to $1,600 and removed the means test previously put in place by the present Leader of the Opposition. Unlike the previous government, this government is fundamentally committed to replacing energy intensive hot water systems with clean solar hot water.  A boosted solar hot water rebate is designed to do one thing exactly - and that is to provide a maximum number of Australian households with a maximum number of Australian jobs. When I was in Perth on 22 April, I visited the Rheem hot water factory at Welshpool. The CEO from Rheem said this about the boosted solar hot water rebate: 'Firstly, these incentives will address climate change very, very quickly. Secondly, it will stimulate what I believe is a vital Australian industry at a critical time. It will create additional jobs as long as it's directed towards local industry and local manufacture.' And that is the government's intention.The government is delivering on solar schools, with over 4,000 schools around Australia already registered as part of this $480 million program. In last week's budget, as the Prime Minister has just pointed out, the government announced an unprecedented investment of $1.365 billion for the Solar Flagships program - solar flagships to create an additional 1,000 megawatts of solar generation capacity. This is imagination, it is innovation, it is the kind of infrastructure that Australians want to see investment in and it is what this government is doing now. It will provide the opportunity for 1,000 megawatts of solar power to be generated in Australia. That will consolidate Australia's place as a leader in solar technology.There is no policy in place from those opposite on solar power. We know that the member for Flinders jumped out of a plane to tell us that solar panels were at record lows when solar panels were going to record highs, but we are reaching the point of public policy credibility for the Leader of the Opposition. He does not have a solar policy and, at the same time, he does not have a policy on the CPRS. While we are investing in solar infrastructure, providing Australians with the opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, supporting jobs and local infrastructure, the opposition are left in no-man's-land. It is time they took some action and it is time they looked at the good solar policies of the Rudd government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because it goes to a necessary reform in the parliament to provide the single greatest addition to the single age pension for the future. This government proudly backs what was announced on budget night to aid those millions of pensioners around Australia who will benefit from this particular reform. I noticed on budget night that those opposite said, 'That was our policy.' For 12 years they had an opportunity to act on the single age pension and they did absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing! Then, a bit like we have seen in the debate today in relation to infrastructure, what they have done is say: 'We sort of meant to kind of support it. Out there in the community we are going to tell people that we really did support it, but back in Canberra we don't want to fess up to the fact that that's really what our position was.'The Australian people actually see through the double standards of all of that. They saw a government here for 12 years, awash in cash, with $300 billion-plus in revenue coming in off the back of the mining boom beyond the budget parameters. They see this government wrestling with a $210 billion budget revenue collapse because of the global recession, yet they see this government addressing fundamentally the needs of single age pensioners with a necessary reform for the future.The other part of achieving the sustainability of the age pension for the future, however, is to make sure that we make retirement income policy in general, and the age pension in particular, sustainable in the long term. That is why the government have embraced a range of tough spending proposals for the budget, which we announced on budget night - $22 billion worth. These proposals are tough, they are difficult and many of them will actually cause the government considerable difficulty in our communication with the Australian public. But they are necessary for the long term because we need to make sure that, in providing pension reform for all those Australians who need that support, we are also ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability. That is why we have taken the position that we have in relation to the age entitlement for the age pension and that is why it will be moved along the lines which were outlined by the Treasurer on budget night.On top of that, however, I noticed very carefully that those opposite seem to be wobbling around a bit on the question of the age pension. I noticed that as soon as we announced this, again, quick as a flash, the good old member for Warringah, the shadow minister for families, was up and about saying that that was his policy too. In fact he was saying they would bring in the upping of the age pension entitlement age earlier than us. I think that is accurate. I do not think I am misrepresenting you, Tony. I think I have it exactly right - he nods in agreement - that the Liberals' position is to up the age pension entitlement age before the government.We have said quite plainly that we think that age pensioners should be given plenty of time to prepare. That is why we will not start introducing this change until 2017 and we will therefore not bring it into full operation until 2023. The Liberals and those opposite seem to be quite uncomfortable about these dates and indicated on day one of the budget, through their relevant shadow minister, that their position was not to bring it in in 2017 but to bring it in much earlier. I take it, given the absence of any repudiation of that position, that that is the formal position of the Liberal Party.Then I seemed to see some criticism this morning about the government's 'consultation processes' on this matter. Are we beginning the great Leader of the Opposition crabwalk on this position as well? The Leader of the Opposition was always for an emissions trading scheme until one was actually introduced into the parliament. The Leader of the Opposition was always for a whole range of things including infrastructure investment until hard decisions had to be taken. The Leader of the Opposition was supporting the shadow minister for families, with whom he has such a close personal working relationship, on the question of upping the age pension entitlement age until we saw the debate beginning to unfold at the doors this morning.The question which the nation at large would like to know is: what date will the Liberal Party propose to bring this in? Ours is plain - 2017 through until fully operational in 2023 - and necessary to underpin long-term sustainability of the age pension. I would say to those opposite: are we still sticking to the position that the Liberals would bring this in earlier? If so, what is the date, or is this now a matter of inconvenience, profoundly so, within the inner sanctums of the Liberal Party? Given the silence on the part of those opposite I would suggest that we are about to see a crabwalk with pike on this question. The government's policy is clear.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the member for Sturt for this question because it enables me to answer some of the outrageous scaremongering he has been engaged in. On budget night the government outlined some responsible reforms to student income support. Why did we do that? Because the information in the Bradley review clearly showed that this was a program that had problems with its targeting. That is, income support was going to families high up the income spectrum, including families that earned more than $200,000 a year and including families that earned more than $300,000 a year.Faced with that, this government took the tough decision to actually better target student income support. What have we done? No. 1: most people who qualify for student income support qualify because of their family income. We have increased the family income thresholds where people will qualify. Where people would have cut out at low family incomes, now families can get support further up the income spectrum. So many families who would have been in the range of $80,000, $90,000 and $100,000 and who would have missed out under the Liberal Party's scheme will get support under our scheme. Secondly, we have made more generous the way in which students are treated as independent by virtue of their age. Under the Liberal Party's scheme independence was classified as being 25 years of age. We are going to phase that back to 22 years of age. Both of these measures mean more students will qualify. Yes, we have financed those beneficial changes in a tough decision by changing one of the ways in which students qualify to be considered independent and judged on their family income. In terms of the actual way in which students are treated, the ways in which students have been assessed to be independent have been changed, and that is because the evidence in the Bradley review very clearly showed that it was those work test independence ways of being assessed which were leading to this skew of students and their families getting money at the upper income end of the scale.I have got a very clear emerging test here for the member for Sturt - and I will come to the individual example he raises in a moment. My very clear test to the member for Sturt is this - and it goes to the theme of the opposition's attack today which has just outlined its opportunism to anybody watching or anybody listening: we have restructured these benefits so more students benefit. More than 30,000 extra students net benefit. We have restructured these benefits so that more than 30,000 students get more money, we have restructured these benefits so that tens of thousands more students get a student start-up scholarship to help with their course costs at the start of the year and we have restructured these benefits to provide relocation assistance to more people than it was available to before.The choice here for the member for Sturt is very clear: is he going to cut all of these increased benefits in order to finance keeping the work test as it is now - I am not surprised he is running off - knowing that some of that money goes to families who earn $200,000 and $300,000 a year or is he going to make a complete laughing stock of the Leader of the Opposition by saying that we should put more money into this area of government policy? That means, of course, everything the Leader of the Opposition has ever said about debt and deficit will be viewed as a complete farce because he will have authorised one of his shadow ministers going on an expenditure blitz to blow the budget. I will wait to see which it is. I will also wait to see, when this is dealt with in the Senate, whether the word of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer that the only budget bill they are blocking is the private health insurance bill is worth anything - another great test for the two of them and for the Liberal Party overall.On the question of the individual raised by the member for Sturt, if he provides me with the full details, of course I will look at it, and I will look at whether or not on a proper examination of the new income tests the person he is engaged in scaremongering - the person he is frightening and the person's family that he is frightening - is actually eligible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Yesterday the government took the first step towards compulsory acquisition of the Alice Springs town camps. I have taken this action after very serious consideration and in the interests of making sure we give children in these town camps a chance at a safe, healthy and happy life. Anybody in this House who has been to these Alice Springs town camps knows that action is now urgently required. Living conditions are nothing short of appalling. Whether it is acute overcrowding, substandard housing, feral dogs, cockroach infested homes, alcohol abuse or violence - whatever it might be - these town camps, in fact, look more like a war zone than the outskirts of a country town in Australia. They have also been the site of horrific crimes. For many of the people in these town camps, the most basic human right to a safe and healthy life is simply absent.For 10 months, the Australian and Northern Territory governments have been negotiating with Tangentyere Council to implement a plan to transform these town camps. We have explored many different avenues to seek an agreement. Last month, we increased the offer from $50 million to $100 million to upgrade and build new houses and infrastructure in these town camps. I have also made available $25 million for additional accommodation and other emergency facilities and intensive support services in the Alice Springs area.Last Thursday, the final deadline for our negotiations closed. Tangentyere Council, unfortunately, have refused our offer. They will not agree to a fair and consistent tenancy management system. The Australian government and the Northern Territory government cannot agree to a system that does not give tenants in these town camps the same protections that apply to other Australians in other public housing areas. Without proper tenancy arrangements, the government's plan to transform these town camps cannot succeed. It is also the case that Tangentyere Council have reneged on a work plan that was agreed to almost a year ago.I now have no option but to take this step towards compulsory acquisition if we are to have any chance to improve the lives of residents. None of us want to stand by any longer and see the horrific levels of violence, abuse and despair continue in these town camps. It is still possible for Tangentyere Council to accept our offer before 6 July. But I have to say to all concerned that the time for negotiation is now over.</DOC>

 - With the greatest respect to the member, what a very silly question - which was produced by the member for Sturt. The answer to the member's question is clear: yes, the government is changing the system. Why is the government changing the system? Because we are a responsible government that believes that every dollar of student support - indeed, every dollar of government expenditure - should go to the place that it is going to do the most good. When we see a financing system with benefits going to the upper end we ask the question: can we do better to target people in need?The member would not have heard this from the member for Sturt, but the Bradley review, for instance, found that 36 per cent of students who were living at home and who were receiving youth allowance through having been considered independent were from families with incomes over $100,000 and 10 per cent were from families with incomes over $200,000. When you see a result like that, you should ask the question: can we do better? What we have done is something that will be better for students generally. We have reoriented this system so that, rather than being pitched in that way, it will support families in ordinary income ranges. As the member would know, incomes in regional Australia tend to be less than incomes in metropolitan Australia, so any regearing of the system that puts money -  - On the member's question where he asked me about the impact on regional students, I am explaining that, because regional Australia tends to have lower incomes than Australia generally, any system that reorients towards people in ordinary income ranges is better for regional Australia. Let me give the member one example. - To take an example which would have meaning for the member, given his electorate, under the new system that we are proposing a family from the bush with two kids of university age who have to move to study will now be able to automatically receive some support with a family income of up to $139,388. That figure has been increased from the Liberal figure of $75,000 in family income. You can see from those two figures the huge expansion in family income thresholds that will make a difference to people in his electorate. Then there are our Student Start-up Scholarships of $2,254 per year. We are estimating that 146,000 students will be eligible for them next year. That is 133,700 more than currently.Then, of course, on top of that there are our relocation scholarships to benefit the kinds of kids in the member's electorate who need to move to study. This is a system that overall will give extra student support - that is, 38,000 additional students will be on income support and 36,000 more will receive higher payments. I understand from the cat-calling that the position of the Liberal Party must be that they would prefer to give money to families with income over $200,000 and $300,000 a year than to see an extra 36,000 students get income support. They would prefer to do that than to see more students get more money. If that is the contemporary position of the Liberal Party, that says everything any Australian needs to know about their value system, and it is not very pretty indeed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lowe for his question. I am sure members will recall that in October 2006 North Korea conducted an underground nuclear explosion, which was subsequently verified by international agencies. That followed on a few months after a launch of a missile by North Korea, albeit with limited success. Members would also recall that last month North Korea also tested a missile, which was considerably more successful. Today the North Korean official state news agency has claimed that North Korea has conducted a successful underground nuclear test. The claim of a test itself is a very provocative act and the claim of a test itself is worthy of nothing other than the condemnation of Australia, which it gets, and the condemnation of the international community.Australia condemned North Korea's missile launch last month and that condemnation was appropriately joined by the United Nations Security Council and others in our region and internationally. Very regrettably, I have to advise the House that the initial evidence is that North Korea has in fact conducted an underground nuclear explosion. Whilst it will take a couple of days to formally verify that through atmospheric tests, it appears from the early advice and scientific analysis that an underground nuclear explosion occurred in North Korea at 9.54 am local Korean time today or 10.54 am Australian Eastern Standard Time. Seismic activity in the order of a 4.5 Richter scale seismic event was picked up by Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation monitoring stations throughout the region, including in Australia. That data was transmitted by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation monitoring system to Vienna and from Vienna has been relayed to other national and international agencies, including our own Geoscience Australia.As I indicated to the House, it will take a couple of days to confirm absolutely from atmospheric tests that this is indeed a nuclear underground explosion. Australia for the moment is proceeding on the basis that North Korea has conducted an underground nuclear explosion. On that basis, North Korea is in flagrant breach of its international obligations, is in flagrant breach of United Nations Security Council resolution 1718, and, as such, stands condemned.Australia will conduct itself in the same manner it did after the missile launch by North Korea last month. We will immediately consult with our allies and our partners in the region, the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan, and with their assistance take this matter to the Security Council. On the basis that North Korea has conducted a nuclear underground explosion, it deserves and gets nothing other than our absolute condemnation, and that condemnation should be echoed around our region and the globe. There is only one option for North Korea: it should immediately desist from all of these provocative acts; it should immediately comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions - in particular, resolution 1718; and it should immediately resume the six-party talks.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Gross public debt peaks at $300 billion -  -  - As I said to the House yesterday, gross public debt -  -  - I thank the honourable member for his question. Gross public debt peaks, as I advised the House yesterday, at around $300 billion, which is 21.7 per cent of GDP. When it rises in aggregate terms to $315 billion, that is 21.4 per cent of GDP. As I advised the House yesterday, therefore, 'peaking' is at 21.7 per cent of GDP, which is around $300 billion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question because he, like various members of this House, is proud of the government's nation-building strategy for recovery. Our nation-building strategy for recovery involves construction of infrastructure right across Australia, including in Corangamite - and including in various of those seats which were referred to in this House yesterday when it seemed that honourable members from benches opposite were pleased to attend local launch ceremonies while pretending in this chamber that they did not support the measures through the House which gave funding for those local launch ceremonies of infrastructure. I am surprised by that.Under the Nation Building for Recovery plan, there are 115 projects underway in the member's electorate at a cost of $49 million. These include 87 projects under the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history across 72 schools in the Corangamite electorate. There are 18 social housing units being built. There are 10 projects under the government's black spot and boom gates programs, including $510,000 in black spot funding for the Princes Highway West in Belmont. There is $6 million going to five local councils under the Community Infrastructure Program, including $2 million towards a wide-ranging sports facility at Bannockburn which will include new netball, football, soccer and tennis facilities for young families moving into the area.These projects are supporting jobs and small businesses in suburbs like Ocean Grove, Torquay, Grovedale and Colac. This is part of the government's Nation Building for Recovery plan - supporting jobs, small business and apprenticeships for today while building the infrastructure Australia needs for tomorrow. If the Liberals had their way in this House, not a single one of these 115 projects would have ever seen the light of day - not a single school would be upgraded, not a single black spot would be repaired and no social housing would be built. The contrast with those opposite is clear for all to see.Right across the nation we have the same construction work underway - investments supporting 200,000 jobs next year and the year after. This is being done through the vehicle of investing in 35,000 projects across the country by year's end. Let us just take a few of these as examples, because those opposite need to be put up close and personal with what is actually going on around the country. Have a look at the Cootamundra to Parkes railway upgrade. This photo shows the first of 301,000 new concrete sleepers being unloaded near Parkes to commence the Cootamundra -  -  - To the great disappointment of those opposite, members on this side of the House will be attending ceremonies right across the country, also making sure that these projects are being rolled out right across the country. Ministers will be attending in each one of the electorates represented by those right across the country, because each of those projects equals jobs, equals infrastructure, equals our nation-building strategy for recovery. The Seymour-Albury rail upgrade - here we go. This photo shows concrete resleepering work being done in the Seymour to Wondonga rail project. -  - I assume that the relevant local member is not interested in this. Work will involve the laying of around 225,000 sleepers to complete an upgraded Melbourne to Sydney corridor, which has seen the laying of over one million new concrete sleepers. Again this is about nation building for recovery. -  - Let us see those opposite laugh and sneer about this. Here we have defence housing in Brisbane. This is a housing site in Brisbane where 41 new defence homes are already under construction. -  - The great thing about Wilson is he is always on song. For Wilson's benefit, in the seat of O'Connor, there are 265 projects, at a value of $37.3 million. Perhaps the member for O'Connor would care to identify which in his electorate he would not wish to proceed - which of these schools would he prefer not to have upgraded? I am surprised; he is normally so quick to his feet. - Nothing. What about the social housing units being constructed? Black spot and boom gate projects - there are 19 in the electorate of O'Connor, worth $5.9 million. You want none of the 23 boom gates - is that correct? Six million dollars for 48 local councils - he wants none of that. I see surprising silence on the part of the member for O'Connor.Defence housing: near and dear to the heart of those opposite, near and dear to the heart of those in the government -  -  - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her intervention, as, given that she is wearing her own high-visibility vest today, she is obviously entering into the spirit of the occasion in terms of launching infrastructure projects across the nation. Also, Manager of Opposition Business, in the electorate of Sturt there are 82 projects, worth an investment of $40 million. Perhaps the member for Sturt, given he comes to the dispatch box so frequently, could identify which of those 82 projects he would not wish to support - 82 projects in 48 schools, $34.5 million into the schools in Sturt. These are funded under the February package, Building the Education Revolution, which those opposite are - supporting or opposing? It is hard to work out. What about the $4 million for the Campbelltown Public Library redevelopment - supporting or opposing? Hmm, there is an interesting silence again on the part of both the member for Sturt, surprisingly, and the member for O'Connor, equally surprisingly. - Oh, how sensitive they are about infrastructure construction! I would say to those opposite: with each one of these 35,000 projects across the nation, we will be there participating in each of them, including in those electorates where the local members are pretending they are not supporting them.With respect to defence housing, I hold up this illustration of 41 new defence homes already under construction. Just two months have elapsed between the announcement of the stimulus plan and the start of construction of these homes. The Defence Housing Authority has been provided with $251 million - The member for Paterson then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. There are something like 74 projects underway in Dobell, including 54 school projects. Isn't that tremendous? It certainly has the support of this side of the House. These projects are supporting jobs and small businesses on the Central Coast of New South Wales. They are a central part of our nation-building plans for recovery. If those opposite had their way, not one of those 74 projects would ever see the light of day.What we see in these projects is economic stimulus in action, supporting jobs in local communities and small business in local communities and making up for the fact that private demand has withdrawn. That is what economic stimulus is all about. And that is what the budget has been about - phase 3 of economic stimulus. Phase 1 last year gave cash to cash-constrained consumers to boost demand and employment, particularly in retail. Phase 2 was in February - our nation-building plans for investment in schools, investment in energy efficiency and investment in social housing. It was economic stimulus for jobs in action. It was nation building for recovery. That is why this program has had the support of the business community. I quote from Peter Anderson, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said:The investment is overdue and will contribute to a more efficient and competitive economy when the recovery arrives.That is what he had to say about the nation-building investment in infrastructure in the recent budget. Heather Ridout, the CEO of the Australian Industry Group, said, 'This spending on infrastructure will be directly supportive of jobs.' Trevor Martyn of the Australian Trucking Association said:Australia's truck drivers will be using the roads funded in tonight's Budget for many years into the future. Our journeys will be safer and faster, with lower transport costs for businesses _The endorsement from the business community goes on, because they recognise the importance of economic stimulus. Those opposite do not. We know they do not have an alternative budget plan or fiscal policy. We heard nothing about it in the Leader of the Opposition's reply. They do not want to admit that they would not borrow one cent less or pay debt back one day earlier. They will not admit that because they want to go around the country and campaign against economic stimulus that creates jobs now and into the future. They cannot bring themselves to support this vital investment in our community. But I certainly take great heart from the fact that Australians, right across this country, understand the importance of economic stimulus and understand the importance of economic stimulus in local communities. That is why governments borrow and that is why they borrow responsibly - to support jobs and to leave a lasting legacy for the nation. That is what this government has done and that is what those opposite are opposing.</DOC>

 - We know those opposite could not find savings in recent budgets. We on this side of the House are up to the task of making the savings in budgets. We made them in the last budget, and we have made them in this year's budget. We are entirely up to the mark in terms of charting a path back to surplus. Of course, those on the other side of the House went on an unsustainable spending spree at the height of the mining boom and they spent like drunken sailors. We know what they did because the member for Higgins blew the whistle in John Howard's biography, where he complained about the spending of the former Prime Minister and his own inability to stop it.What we will see from this side of the House is fiscal discipline. We have put in place a spending cap of two per cent real when growth returns to trend. That is why our objectives are entirely reasonable and achievable. And it is a bit rich when those on that side of the House cannot front up and find any alternative savings in the budget. - As the Prime Minister indicated before, net debt as a percentage of GDP is expected to be 3.74 per cent in 2019-20, charting the path back to surplus and paying down the borrowings in 2015-16. This government has been entirely responsible in supporting the economy in our hour of need. This government has had the courage to support jobs through economic stimulus, to put in place a medium-term fiscal strategy and an expenditure cap to bring the budget back to surplus and to pay down debt. If only those on the other side had the courage to front up to this parliament with an alternate budget policy or fiscal policy. They do not have that courage because they want to play the scare campaign. They are so opportunistic and so devoid of a commitment to the national interest, all we get are these silly political games.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. I note that in the member for Dawson's electorate there are 216 projects that are being invested in through the government's economic stimulus. Of these, 201 are Building the Education Revolution projects in local schools. The member for Dawson knows that that is great news for his local schools and great news for local jobs. He also knows, of course, that the Liberal Party is opposed to each and every one of those projects in his electorate because the Liberals are all about talking the economy down while we build the nation up.The member for Dawson would also know that the projects in his electorate are being joined by projects right around the country in almost 10,000 schools. This is being well received right around the country. The endorsements for this program have been flooding in. To take just one example in the member for Grey's electorate, a primary school on the Yorke Peninsula, where Nick Goodge says:This is seriously once-in-a-lifetime stuff. It's a really exciting prospect for a little school.This is an endorsement about how important this is for local schools. But of course this is also important for local jobs. The Leader of the Opposition has been known to say that Building the Education Revolution is a poor quality spend and that it will not support any jobs. Well, Australians in local communities know the truth and the truth is Building the Education Revolution is there supporting local jobs. To take one example, in the Australian on 8 May there was a report about the impact Building the Education Revolution was having on architectural services. It says:Within a week of the federal Government's announcement of a $14.7 billion schools upgrade program, Law Architects had 10 new projects on its books, worth $20 million.Not in [their] lifetime had the economy been so bad - and business quite so good.The article goes on to quote Ms Law, of the business, who says:When the announcement came out, we were leaping for joy, and when the phones kept ringing we kept leaping _We are flat out. We haven't been this busy for many years _Another firm, which specialises in building and architecture for education facilities, is in the process of hiring up to 12 architects in order to deal with the economic stimulus work. Given the National Party has been left in charge of the House today, we might note that in the member for Riverina's electorate her local newspapers are noting that the Building the Education Revolution program is supporting local jobs. One of her local newspapers reports that Laing O'Rourke will manage the overall project and its time frames and has been inundated with applications from the local department of commerce, accredited builders, tradespeople and small businesses with school experience who want to play a role in the program. He is going to base teams in the local area in order to back this program.Then we have the endorsement from the contractor responsible for overseeing the maintenance at a school called Alexandria Park Community School. The head of that contractor says that 'there is little doubt that several of those small and medium-sized businesses would not have survived the global financial crisis without benefiting from government infrastructure contracts'. So the evidence is clear from people in local communities who are in touch with what is happening in their communities. On the other side of this House, all we see is continued opportunism. Depending on the moment, they will blurt out whatever comes into their mind next. In terms of blurting out whatever comes into their mind next, some days they blurt out 'debt' and 'deficit'. Some days they blurt out that they proudly voted no. Some days the member for Gilmore and others are going thumbs up for local projects. Some days the member for Wentworth is trying to get himself into the local photograph. People obviously notice this cheap opportunism and these inconsistencies. The members opposite, in their embarrassment and shame because they did not stand up for jobs in their local communities, are yelling out, but the Australian community knows the truth. This side of the House stands for Building the Education Revolution; this side of the House stands for supporting local jobs; this side of the House stands for building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. Those opposite stand for talking the economy down and the sort of carping we have just seen.</DOC>

 - The very first point that needs to be made is that I do not accept necessarily the premise of the question. I do not accept the assertions about the levels of surplus whatsoever. I do not accept them at all. What I do know - and this is something the previous government did not do - is that we have published more information on our medium-term fiscal strategy than any government prior to now. We have done that for a very serious purpose. We are in the middle of a once-in-75-years event, which has had a dramatic impact on this country. - I am responding to the question, Mr Speaker, because what has occurred in this budget year is that taxation collections have dramatically fallen, by $210 billion over the forward estimates. There has been a dramatic collapse in taxation revenues, and the responsible course of action for a government in those circumstances is to borrow to support the economy - to support jobs and to support small business. That is precisely what we are doing. The responsible course of action in the circumstances is to chart a course back to surplus, to bring the budget back to surplus as soon as we possibly can - in 2015-16 - and to pay down those borrowings. That is the course that we have set out in the budget papers.In addition to that, we have put in place some tight fiscal rules. We have said - we said this in UEFO; we said it in February of this year but it was not the subject of any questioning in this House at that time - that there would be a two per cent, real, cap on spending. We said that because we have been prepared to take the courageous and decisive steps to support employment in our economy, to support business, and we have had the support of the business community in doing that. They recognise how important it is to borrow to build infrastructure - the jobs for today and the jobs for tomorrow. They do understand the importance of investing in our educational facilities and the need to borrow to do that to bring a lasting benefit to our nation and our children. They all understand that. The only people in the country who do not understand it are those opposite. We do have the support of the business community and we have the support of most responsible economists because they all understand that when revenues collapse governments borrow to support their economy. That is precisely what we are doing.The levels of net debt here are low by world standards - very, very low by world standards. We can afford to support our people and we are doing that and we are proud of it. But we also understand our responsibility to pay down those borrowings. We understand that totally, which is why the budget papers contain so much information on our medium-term fiscal strategy. Our strategy is very simple - to bring the budget back to surplus in 2015-16 and reduce the levels of net debt to 3.7 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. That is a reasonable thing to do. It is a responsible course of action and the only irresponsible course of action is the one being taken by those opposite in this House today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. Indeed, in the Flynn electorate alone, 13 projects worth some $2.3 million have been approved under the Black Spot Program as part of our stimulus plan. There is $100,000 to fix a black spot in Tannum Sands on Hampton Drive near St Francis Catholic school, $1 million to fix a black spot on the Capricorn Highway in the small town of Comet, $60,000 to fix a black spot at the intersection of Falcon Street and Duck Street near the day care centre in Longreach, and 10 other projects in the electorate of Flynn, every one of them leading to support for local jobs, every one of them stimulating the local economy and every one of them leading to an improvement in road safety for all the residents of Flynn and those who travel through the electorate of Flynn. This is just one component of the stimulus package, which is delivering 412 projects for Flynn, worth some $65.7 million.The Black Spot Program was increased by $150 million as part of the economic stimulus plan, meaning that over the next couple of years we are spending a quarter of a billion dollars on black spots, part of the 70 per cent of the economic stimulus plan that we are putting into infrastructure. This additional funding is delivering an additional 607 black spot projects around the country.I am asked also how this has been received by local members and by the community. You can always rely upon the National Party - always good for some material. The member for Gippsland, when he was in Canberra on 26 February, said this:What I'm saying is the government has gone for a very low quality spending spree. We have seen a very low quality spend of taxpayers' money.In accordance with that principle, he voted against the expansion of the Black Spot Program; he voted against the Building the Education Revolution program; he voted against the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program; he voted against all the measures in our stimulus package.So I was a bit surprised to look at yesterday's copy of the Latrobe Valley Express, where there is a lovely photo of Mr Chester at an intersection upgrade that he voted against declaring how terrific it is - in fact, speaking on behalf of the federal government. So I went to the Nationals website. A press release by Mr Chester was headed 'Dangerous roads to be upgraded'. There are at least two press releases. He has gone through each of the programs, outlining how terrific it is that the federal government is doing these projects and supporting the projects that he voted against. His press release also says:_ he would continue to work with State and Federal Government Ministers to secure more funding to improve the safety of local roads.I will give you the hint, brother: just vote for it! When these packages come before the parliament, just vote for them. Just sit on this side of the chamber and vote with the government. That would be a good start.Of course, the opportunism does not stop there when it comes to the National Party. Indeed, it is just beginning. The member for Mallee put out a press release also, and he said this about black spot funding:This sort of essential infrastructure upgrade spending must be sustained in regional Australia despite economic recession.Correct.Black spot funding goes to the heart of road safety.Correct.There's plenty more that needs to be spent, so I'm hopeful this Black Spot funding does not become a casualty of the May Budget.Listen to this, folks:Expenditure on economic infrastructure is the best way to generate sustainable jobs into the future.Then he goes through the 20 projects in Mallee that he voted against.But there is more - although I must say I am not sure about this. I want to give the member for Maranoa the benefit of the doubt because, when I looked at the press release welcoming our funding that he voted against, I looked at the date: Wednesday, 1 April 2009. Given he voted against it, it might just be an April Fools joke. But there he is, praising the green light for Kingaroy road funding, praising the right move for Dalby road funding. I table that release; I table the releases from Mr Chester; I table the Latrobe Valley Express; I table the media release from the member for Mallee. It is quite clear, when you look at why they say one thing in Canberra and something else in the electorate, that they know that what they do here is not fair dinkum. They know that our economic stability package is not only good for their electorates; it is good for the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. She, of course, well knows that there are 132 projects underway in her electorate. She is very supportive of those projects, because they bring local jobs. As well as building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow, they are providing the jobs we need today in electorates like hers, particularly in suburbs like Hallett Cove, Seaford and Woodcroft. Indeed, in the area of housing, there are 20 new homes being built in her electorate at a cost of $6.1 million in the first stage of the social housing stimulus package. If the Liberals had their way, not a single one of those 132 projects would be going ahead - not the education, not the social housing, not the large infrastructure and not the small grants there either. It is clear that, while we are building the economy up, the Liberals are talking it down - constant negativity on the issue of jobs for the future.Just three weeks ago, I visited Hackham with the member for Kingston and saw the work about to commence on 16 homes in her electorate. While I was there, I spoke to Bradley Jansen, the Managing Director of Qattro, the company that are building these homes. Qattro currently have 14 employees but, of course, as is the way with building companies, they have about 40 to 50 full-time-equivalent contractors on their books at any one time. Prior to the announcement of the stimulus package, Qattro were considering laying people off. Instead, when they heard about the stimulus package in social housing, they attended an information forum about it. They saw the opportunities for their business and, instead of laying people off, they are now putting people on. Indeed, they decided against redundancies that they had planned. As well as the project that we are talking specifically about, Mr Jansen wrote to us and said:The social housing stimulus package gave us confidence to plan positively for the future. This confidence, coupled to responsible management, has helped us view this economic cycle as one of opportunity as opposed to one of doom and gloom. Thanks again to your team and the Federal Government for supporting our business, our staff and supplier subcontractor base.It is well worth remembering that, as well as this particular project of 16 homes, the investment that is provided through the stimulus package has unlocked equity that Qattro have. It has meant that they have been able to go right through their building supply chain. Projects that they had stalled because of the very tight finance environment will proceed because they have been able to do this deal with the South Australian Housing Trust to build these 16 homes. Qattro say:This has allowed us to plan for the re-utilisation of the equity and profits on other projects on our books that are currently stalled due to tightened institutional funding.It is also worth saying that, as well as putting on a new trainee just yesterday and putting on a new contract manager in the next few weeks, Qattro attended a local jobs summit last week that was organised by the member for Kingston. She is a very active member and, indeed, on the day that we were in her electorate she spotted a fellow across the road from the Hackham Business Association - a very nice man; Lloyd I think his name was - and said: 'Lloyd! Lloyd! Come over and meet these people.' She introduced them to Qattro, and Lloyd said, 'Yeah, we've got a brickie up the road and we've got an electrician down here.' Qattro have attended the local jobs summit in Kingston and have been able to make connections with local tradespeople and local suppliers there. So the flow-on effects of jobs in that area are supported by this investment in social housing.The Daily Telegraph has been reporting over the last two days on homelessness in Western Sydney. As well as these fantastic job benefits, it is also worth remembering that we are building 20,000 new units of social housing and fixing up more than 10,000 homes that would have been lost as accommodation because of their poor state. Through these 30,000 extra properties and another 50,000 properties through our National Rental Affordability Scheme, we are putting roofs over the heads of families that need to house their children and that need help at a time when they are particularly vulnerable. I would love to hear from the opposition what their plan is to support these families that need a roof over the heads of their children and I would love to hear from them what their plans are to support jobs in construction. If they have a plan, they did not enunciate it in the budget reply speech and they did not enunciate it down there at the National Press Club, when they could have. There was not a word on homelessness, not a word on housing these people and not a word on construction jobs.</DOC>

 - It is one hour and 16 minutes into question time and there has not been a single question from those opposite on action on climate change - not a single question on the topic which dominated the joint party room this morning amid such a celebration of party unity, or cross-party unity, as I have heard it described. What the Australian nation saw today was the Leader of the Opposition rolled in his own joint party room. What we saw today was, once again - as on Work Choices, so today on climate change - the Leader of the Opposition rolled by the ideological hard right-wing of his own party and the National Party. The Leader of the Opposition came to the leadership of the Liberal Party rolling his predecessor -  - The relevance to certainty on climate change goes to what happens in the Senate through the votes of the National Party and the Liberal Party. That is why this question is of direct relevance to business certainty, certainty on the actions to be taken at Copenhagen, actions which would be necessary to provide Australia with hope on acting on climate change, to help save the Barrier Reef, to help save Kakadu, to take necessary action for the future -  -  - and those opposite scoff at that possibility. The Leader of the Opposition undertook a political campaign within the Liberal Party to roll his predecessor, with one of his causes being he would be strong on climate change. He accused his predecessor of being weak on climate change. That was the political attack. What happened today was that the Leader of the Opposition was rolled in the Liberal Party party room, rolled in the joint party room, by the climate change sceptics - the self-proclaimed climate change champion rolled by the climate change sceptics. That is what happened on the part of those opposite.Let us go to what currently constitutes the position of those opposite, given how intimidated the current leader of the Liberal Party is by the person who seeks to replace him as the leader of the Liberal Party - that is, the member for Higgins. Remember in the joint party room the member for Higgins -  - Remember the member for Higgins, who now comes to consciousness, glad that he is mentioned in the chamber, so he can participate fully in the debate. He did so in the joint party room some time ago when he said there are two things -  - The dynamics of the Liberal Party party room and the joint party room is of direct relevance to what happens in the Senate. The reason we know what happens there is that you leak it all out. That is why we all know - and we know within an hour of it occurring. As my colleague said, there are in fact many emissions from those opposite when it comes to the way in which they leak from their own party room.The next leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Higgins, said in the party room recently that the two things they have got to do are stand against action on climate change and support Work Choices. What have we seen in the most recent few months? Precisely that course of action being supported here in the chamber. The leadership of the current Leader of the Opposition has been fundamentally undermined by his inability to stand up to the climate change sceptics in his own party. The reason those opposite are silent during this debate is they know it to be true. It is exactly what has transpired.Let us go to the current position of those opposite, which is that action should be deferred on climate change pending - wait for it - another review. Let us quickly go to the evolving position of the Liberal Party on this question. What did they say back in December 2007? The then spokesman said, 'We will set both medium- and long-term targets after the Garnaut review.' The Garnaut review was on 30 September 2008. Then they went on to say, 'We won't set any figures until we see the government's modelling.' Treasury modelling was released on 30 October 2008. Then they said, 'We will look at what the government comes up with in its white paper and see what the Treasury modelling is when it comes out.' Well, that was released on 15 December 2008. Then they said that they would take a position after the Pearce report was delivered - that is their own internal inquiry. The Pearce report apparently delivered its findings on 30 April 2009. Then we had the member for Goldstein say, 'Well, we'll finally sort out our alternative once the Senate inquiry has been concluded.' The Senate inquiry, they have ensured, has been delayed until 15 June 2009. Then they say it is going to happen once we have a Productivity Commission inquiry. There is no fixed date. What you have here is a rolling series of excuses to underpin the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has not had the courage to take on the climate change sceptics in his own party. It is an absolute failure of leadership on his part and he knows it.What Australia is looking for at present on climate change and what the business community is looking for on climate change is certainty. They have called publicly for certainty. When you look at the statements by the Australian Industry Group and by the Business Council of Australia, they want certainty for the future, and the Leader of the Opposition in response to this call for business certainty has simply gone missing. When those in the broader Australian community want action at Copenhagen to provide Australia with some hope of appropriately helping to protect the Barrier Reef and Kakadu in the long term, the Leader of the Opposition has gone missing. All Australians wanted this Leader of the Opposition to stand up and to defy the climate change sceptics in his own party, but instead of acting in the national interest he is acting in the narrow interest of the Liberal Party all the way through this. -  - I heard an interjection from those opposite saying that this represents a misrepresentation on our part. I have gone through seven reasons they have given in the last 12 months to prevent them from taking a final position on climate change and carbon pollution reduction, and those opposite say that we are misrepresenting the facts. Those opposite had an opportunity in their party room today - most particularly the Leader of the Opposition - to show some leadership, to take a position, to actually stand up for the national interest rather than to act purely in terms of the Leader of the Opposition's personal interest.The moral authority of the Leader of the Opposition on climate change, and more broadly, was shredded once and for all in the joint party room today. The member for Higgins, representing the next leadership of the Liberal Party, went in there a couple of months ago and said, 'The Liberal Party cannot support this action on climate change,' and what we saw today was the current Leader of the Opposition buckle to that pressure. Australia demands action in the national interest and what we have seen instead is partisan action on the part of those opposite, an absolute failure of leadership and an undermining of the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question; 'Sloppy Joe' has changed tactics. - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. He asserted in his earlier question that it would require surpluses in excess of two per cent of GDP. That is what he said. He has now suddenly crab-walked away from that assertion. The budget indicates that net -  - You have walked away from your assertion. You pretended that it would require surpluses of two per cent of GDP and now you have walked away from it because it is simply not credible. You have completely walked away from it. Those opposite are just acutely embarrassed by the fact that they have been exposed to the Australian people as not having an alternative fiscal policy - not a one - and that is what this questioning is all about.The member for Dickson then left the chamber. - Net debt as a percentage of GDP is 3.7 per cent in 19-20. -  - In 2019-20. And there we go again. The juvenile games as a substitute for the fact that there is not one element of fiscal policy in anything they have said. - And why are they so upset - 3.7 per cent of GDP. Let us just have a look around the world at what the international comparisons are. - Earlier, he was proposing that the figures were wrong; now he is saying they are right. Which one is it, Joe? Very, very sloppy. - Those opposite are absolutely embarrassed by the fact that the budget puts in place structural saves over the long term to bring the budget back to surplus and to pay down debt. They are embarrassed by the fact that they have no structural savings whatsoever. What we saw in the House for their budget reply was this fudge of the tobacco tax increase, which was somehow supposed to make up for the fact that they are going to oppose our means test of the private health insurance rebate. A fundamental save to bring the budget back to surplus and to pay down debt, and who is opposing it? All of those opposite. So they are not serious about a serious medium-term fiscal policy. We have one and they do not and it is there for everybody to see.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for the question. The fact is that certainty is absolutely critical to the business community and to the Australian community in determining what appropriate measures and actions should be taken to respond to the dangerous threat of climate change. The fact is that action on delivering the necessary investment for clean technologies and for energy efficiencies is absolutely central to our efforts to reduce Australia's carbon pollution. And for that investment to take place, business needs certainty. The Prime Minister has just referred to that. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and others have made clear on many occasions how important, in terms of economic planning, certainty really is.The government recognise this because we have brought forward a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme for this parliament to consider, and we recognise it because we are bringing the largest ever rollout of a clean energy initiative seen in this country. I notice today a statement by the Australian renewable energy company Pacific Hydro, who, in responding to a major financing deal that they have announced today in relation to Chile, said:Australia will benefit from similar significant investment and job creation opportunities once the climate change and energy policies proposed by the Rudd Government are put in place.Pacific Hydro went on to say:We call on the Australian Parliament to ensure passage of both the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) and the 20% Renewable Energy Target (RET) this year so we can set about the task of transforming our stationary energy sector into one that is substantially less carbon intensive and better able to compete on the world stage.That was the message today from one of Australia's leading renewable energy companies.But what was the message that we got from the opposition? What we have seen today is a comprehensive failure of the position that the Leader of the Opposition has held ever since he came into political life. What is more, it is a position that shows that economic policy in the opposition has been abrogated to the National Party. The opposition's position seems to be: 'We aren't prepared to do anything, but we'll call for another report.' Let us just see how long this has been going on. In 1997 the then environment minister, Robert Hill, established an inquiry into emissions trading. In 1999 the Australian Greenhouse Office released four discussion papers on emissions trading. In 2002 the previous Prime Minister announced Australia would not ratify the Kyoto protocol. In 2003 the then Treasurer and the environment minister took a submission to cabinet to establish an emissions trading scheme, only to see it vetoed. That was six years ago.Six years ago, the opposition, when they were in government, were looking at an emissions trading scheme. In fact, as the opposition leader said on Lateline on 9 July:The Coalition's policy, the Howard Government's policy last year was that we would establish an emissions trading system not later than 2012.And he went on to say -  - This will interest the member for Flinders:It was not conditional on international action, it was obviously done in the context of international action.What has happened today is this. On one side of the opposition benches we have the National Party, who are sceptical about climate change and want to deny its impact and to delay it. On the other side we have the Leader of the Opposition, who previously has held that climate change is an issue that needs to be addressed. But, when the press releases came out today, I could not help noticing that the press release by the coalition announced that the coalition wants to be in touch with the rest of the world on this issue. I thought to myself: why would that trouble the opposition when, in government, they were perfectly happy not to be in touch with the rest of the world on this particular issue? - I am glad that the member for Wide Bay, the Leader of the Nationals, has made a timely intervention because it gives me the opportunity to respond to his comments about an emissions trading scheme in which, if I read them correctly in the Age, he said something to the effect that it is a 'job-destroying rabid dog' scheme. So imagine the instructions that the Leader of the Opposition gives to the Productivity Commission: 'I want you to consider the matter of an emissions trading scheme. Ignore the comments from my senior colleague that it is a job-destroying rabid dog scheme when it comes to your views.'Seriously, that is where members of the opposition are at on this issue. And then we saw the release from the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, Barnaby Joyce. Senator Joyce has seen fit to put his views on the record and state with absolute crystal clarity what the Nationals' position on an ETS is. It has got nothing to do with deferring. It has got nothing to do with referring matters to the Productivity Commission. It has got nothing to do with waiting for any more time to allow other countries to do what the opposition cannot get its act together to think about: what it wants to do. It is all to do with the fact that the National Party do not want one at all. Why do we know that? Because Senator Joyce says that 'delay is a vote against the ETS' and then goes on to say that the goal of the Nationals is:_ to stop the scheme and utilise whatever mechanisms it possibly can to do that _So what we have today is a position that has come out of the party room of the opposition, where economic and climate change policy is being determined by climate change deniers, agrarian socialists and hokey contrarians. Frankly, it is not good enough, and the opposition leader should show some leadership on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I can tell him very clearly what advice I have received. I have received advice that over 100,000 students will be better off - that is, 68,000 students will receive income support for the first time and 35,000 students will receive higher payments. What the changes to the parental income test mean is that parents can earn more before their children start to lose income support - and I think that, as a regional member, the regional member will be very interested in these statistics. The way the scheme currently works is that, for a student to receive the maximum away-from-home payment of $371.40 a fortnight, the income of their family has to be $32,800 or less. Under the new scheme, that threshold will increase to $42,559. And then we have changed the taper rate. The current taper rate is 25 per cent. The taper now will be 20 per cent.For the regional member - and I know he will be concerned about this because he will know about incomes in his electorate - I point out that, under the Rudd government scheme, that means a family with university-age kids of 17 years and 21 years living away from home can receive support up to a family income of $139,388. That is compared with a family income of $75,324 now. He would know, as a regional member, that the average annual household wage and salary index study shows us that in regional and rural areas we are talking on average about household incomes of $54,500 - that is, on average the constituents in his electorate fit into this scheme and will get student income support. That is before we moved to the question of the scholarships that we are having under our scheme. - Thank you, Mr Speaker, as this is a serious topic and I am treating the answer seriously. The Rudd government is also introducing student start-up scholarships. Some 146,000 students will get these. That is a major increase from the 12,900 scholarships available now. And we are introducing 14,200 new relocation scholarships. That is also a major increase on the number of relocation scholarships available now.The member also asked me about the characterisation of who is 'independent' for student income support. This goes to the question of the gap year, which was just raised with me. I can say to the member this on the question of the gap year that he has raised and on the independence test for student income support: the Bradley review found that, in relation to that test, income support was poorly targeted. The Bradley review found that 36 per cent of independent students living at home were from families with incomes over $100,000, 10 per cent in that situation were from families earning more than $150,000 and 10 per cent came from families earning over $200,000. When I received that information from the Bradley review, I was concerned about poor targeting. But I was not the only one. Let me quote something to the member which I think he will find very relevant. Let me quote the following advice I got along the way:If the government is serious about reform, then come Budget time we should see some consideration given to reforms suggested by Bradley in student income support - to ensure that sufficient support is going to those who need it.I accepted that advice. It came from the shadow minister for education. - Yes, I was. - It is confidential.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. It is nice to get a question on health. It has been a number of days since the budget and we have not had any serious questions from the opposition on health, we have not had one on infrastructure and we have not had one on family and community services. In fact, even as I stand here today there does not appear to be a health spokesperson or an education spokesperson even here in the chamber. We are determined to invest in health. It is why in our budget we are making historic investments in hospitals, in primary care and in infrastructure in a whole range of different areas. The fact that every Australian can receive free treatment in a public hospital, no matter where they live and no matter what their income level is, is something that Labor is absolutely committed to. It is why the government has invested more than 50 per cent more into our public hospitals than the previous government did in its last agreement.It seems clear to me that the opposition are really struggling to come up with any alternative health policy. I can imagine after the budget the Leader of the Opposition sitting down, perhaps with the member for Dickson and perhaps sharing a Bacardi Breezer or something, and having a chat over what sort of a response they might make. I would not be surprised if the member for Dickson does not have any suggestions and I imagine that the Leader of the Opposition might decide to call an elder statesman of the Liberal Party, so put a call in to say, 'What sorts of ideas do you have for our health policy?' I am pretty sure that call was made because shortly after we saw some comments coming out that seemed to be the formulation of health policy. We heard the member for Dickson exclaiming, 'We need to get private patients out of public hospitals.' Then we heard the Leader of the Opposition speaking fondly of his utopian vision that every Australian would have private health insurance. It seems to me that the view was becoming clearer and clearer about what the Liberal Party sees as a sensible health policy: take money out of public hospitals and force everybody into private health insurance. I am sure it will not be long before they are attacking Medicare.So you might, on this side of the House, be asking: 'Who was it? Who was it that the Leader of the Opposition called in his hour of need?' I want to give the House a bit of a clue. It is an elder statesman in the Liberal Party. It is a person who has been in the parliament for a long time. He is a man of ideas - I know that does limit the people that it might be. He is a man of vision, which does rule out the member for Higgins, in case anybody thought it was him.The Leader of the Opposition decided to call somebody with real policy gravitas and I would like to give you a quote, before I tell you who this person was. Listen to this interview conducted with the then Liberal shadow minister for health. The interviewer says simply, 'So the proposal is the end of Medicare and for everyone to pay for private health insurance?' The shadow minister says: 'Yes, no Medicare. Yes, everybody to be privately insured.' And who do you think the architect was - the true ideological grandfather? - Of course, that is right. Malcolm would turn to the member for O'Connor for advice on health policy - taking us not just a decade back but two decades back into Liberal Party thinking on health policy. No wonder there have been no questions from the opposition on health after the budget.We are determined to invest in public hospitals. We are determined to support those who have private health insurance. We are determined to get the right balance, and we expect the Leader of the Opposition to be prepared to do the same. He should recant on his view that every single Australian must have private health insurance and he should start backing our investments in public hospitals so that every Australian can get their care in a public hospital free of charge if that is what they choose.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. What I would say in response to it is that, notwithstanding the fact that the government debt and deficit strategy is the lowest debt of any major advanced economy in the world and has been reaffirmed with a AAA credit rating by Standard and Poor's, the government's strategy for dealing with the return to surplus and the payment of debt is outlined in the budget papers. The government stands by that strategy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This morning I was briefed by the Chief Medical Officer on the global public health challenge of human swine influenza and its development in Australia. As of 1200 hours Eastern Standard Time today, the total number of confirmed human swine influenza cases had risen to 61. Among states and territories the numbers are as follows: Victoria, 33; New South Wales, 18; Queensland, five; South Australia, three; Western Australia, one; and the Australian Capital Territory, one. The Australian community should prepare for the number of swine flu cases to continue to increase consistent with the pattern we have seen in other countries around the world. The World Health Organisation confirmed that human-to-human transmission has occurred in the following countries: Belgium, Canada, Chile, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Panama, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. Globally, the World Health Organisation has confirmed 46 countries officially reporting 12,594 cases of human swine influenza. Specifically, in Canada the number of confirmed cases has risen to 921, in Japan the number of confirmed cases has risen to 350 and in the United States the number of confirmed cases has risen to 6,764.As we consider these numbers, it is important to remember that we are coming into the flu season, while the Northern Hemisphere is moving out of its flu season. Like the normal seasonal flu, most people with swine flu will experience mild symptoms. The CMO advises that people who are treated quickly with antivirals will have a speedy recovery. We know that swine influenza has a hard edge - that is, in a small proportion of cases it can be more severe. That is why, while there is no cause for alarm or panic, we need to remain vigilant and will continue to carefully monitor the situation and act on the advice of our medical experts.The Commonwealth, along with states and territories, has already acted to advise students returning from countries with a concerning level of transmission that they should remain at home for seven days; has acted to close six schools, four in Victoria and two in South Australia; has provided information to emergency departments and GPs on known characteristics and risk factors for the disease; has established a hotline at 1802007, which has already received a number of inquiries; has ensured that airports have a clinical presence with nurses available; and has, on the advice of the CMO, included swine influenza to be a quarantineable disease in humans under the Quarantine Act 1908, so that people likely to have been exposed to potential swine flu can be placed under surveillance and potentially quarantined.All incoming passenger flights are required to report to the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, AQIS, on the health status of passengers on the planes. With the use of thermal scanners at international airports, passengers detected as having a raised temperature may be required to provide a nose or throat swab. Health declaration cards have been made compulsory for all international flights since 6 May. Health message signs have also been installed at international airports. Government advertising on radio and in newspapers providing information about what to do if you have symptoms of swine flu has commenced and the pandemic alert has been upgraded to CONTAIN as of 22 May 2009.The government has had a number of measures in place to closely monitor the situation. The Australian Health Protection Committee, made up of the Commonwealth and state and territory chief medical officers, meets twice daily. Officials in all jurisdictions have been engaged through the National Pandemic Emergency Committee in a 24-hour national incident room at the federal department of health. Critically, Australia remains one of the best prepared countries in the world for a possible pandemic, with a stockpile of more than 8.7 million courses of antivirals. Earlier today the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Chief Medical Officer launched new television ads to ensure that proper information is being provided to parents and to families.Finally, I also take this opportunity to provide an important message to all Australians. If you are experiencing flu-like symptoms - fever, sore throat, cough, headache and muscle aches and pains - seek the advice of a health professional. Each one of us can take steps to avoid the spread of the flu by simple things: firstly, washing your hands often and thoroughly; secondly, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze and cough; and, thirdly, disposing of used tissues in the bin. Finally, if any person in the public is experiencing flu-like symptoms, we would urge them to seek medical advice and try to avoid close contact with others.</DOC>

 - Yesterday we had some sloppy behaviour from the shadow Treasurer. He came into the House proving that he had not done his homework and made an assertion that we needed to run surpluses of two per cent for eight years. He then moved from that assertion in subsequent questions and he cited a table in the budget papers which actually proved that assertion wrong. The fact is that we do not have to run budget surpluses of that order for eight years. What we do have to run are budget surpluses around one per cent or a little higher through that period, and that is entirely achievable.When it comes to the provision of information, this government has provided more information than those on the other side ever considered providing at any stage. We are absolutely serious about implementing our medium-term fiscal strategy. Those opposite are acutely embarrassed because they do not have one. So they come in here and cast doubt on growth forecasts and somehow imply that the information is suspect, because they want to run a scare campaign on deficits and borrowing. They are acutely embarrassed, because they know that the Australian people want this government to put in place economic stimulus to support jobs in our community. - All of those are in the budget papers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm. Like the member for Corio, I think that particularly Victorian members in this House are very focused on the fast spread of this disease in Australia. I want to just add a couple of points to those made by the Prime Minister that I think will be of interest to the House. In doing so, I might just remind people that this disease came onto the international radar about six weeks ago in Mexico. The Australian government has been using all its efforts to ensure that we delay for as long as possible the entry of this disease into Australia. That has bought us valuable time both in the hope of producing a vaccine quickly by the time we have large numbers of people suffering from this disease in Australia, and also learning more about the disease - how it spreads and who it is particularly having an impact on. So the delay has benefited this community.But as the Prime Minister indicated, we are at 61 cases in Australia. Looking at how that developed, our first case was confirmed on 9 May. We had six cases a week ago. We had 31 at the same time yesterday, and there are 61 today. So Australians do have to prepare themselves for the fact that we will see an increase in those numbers. We are seeing the disease spread rapidly in the same way, for example, it did in Japan where in a very short space of time, particularly in high schools, we saw the numbers rise. They are now at 350 confirmed cases.We know that most people in Australia are experiencing very mild symptoms. Obviously, getting early treatment with antivirals has assisted with that and we hope that that will continue to be the case. But the Prime Minister mentioned the harder edge that this disease does have, and that is that a small proportion of cases can be very severe. We know this is now a disease of young people and that it has a particular impact on children and teenagers. We have also seen from the patterns overseas that pregnant women and asthmatics and others with respiratory problems are particularly at risk. Unfortunately, I do need to remind the House that there have been 92 deaths from this disease across the world, mostly in Mexico. There have been 10 deaths in the United States, one in Canada and one in Costa Rica.The Prime Minister has taken the House through the range of steps that have been taken to try to delay the disease from coming into Australia and to handle its identification and treatment now that it is in Australia - and I will not repeat those steps. Members of this House will increasingly be getting calls at their electorate offices. People will be looking to us to provide proper information to them. The swine flu hotline is still the best source of reliable information for people to use. The number is 1802007. It has been in place for more than a month. Unsurprisingly, we have seen a spike in the number of calls over the last 24 hours. Please do not hesitate to encourage your constituents who need advice to use that hotline.I also take this opportunity to advise members - if they have not seen the invitation already - that Professor Jim Bishop has offered to brief all members first thing on Monday on what we know about the spread of this disease around the world. Obviously the situation is changing. I note that Professor Bishop has been providing briefings to both the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow health minister. I understand that more of those briefings will be provided. We are happy to do that and we appreciate the support that has been shown. Obviously this is a difficult and changing situation and we all need to work together. Similarly, we are working closely with the states and territories. We are pleased that they are taking some additional steps in terms of communicating with each other about people travelling across state borders. Also, many of the jurisdictions are setting up special flu clinics. As we move into our flu season, many people who have seasonal flu will fear that they have swine flu. So making sure that facilities are available for the proper testing, identification and handling of the disease is going to be increasingly important.We need to remain vigilant. We need to keep up our efforts to contain this disease. People should follow the advice of their medical practitioner. Those who are travelling should take care and ensure that they look at the advice provided on the Smartraveller website, which my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs is ensuring is kept up to date as the situation changes around the world. There is no cause for alarm and panic, but the Prime Minister has encouraged people to follow proper flu etiquette. That might sound like a strange thing, but it is valuable in the containment of this disease. Please make sure that you encourage anyone you are in contact with to follow that etiquette and we will be able to reduce the spread of this disease.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition, in his question, referred to 'dubious assumptions'. Can I just say that the most dubious assumption being advanced by those opposite is that this country's deficit and debt strategy is not consistent with a responsible return to budget surplus. The government has provided five years of sets of forecasts and projections for the future; our predecessors provided four. The government's strategy to return the budget to surplus is outlined in the budget papers. We stand by the strategy.</DOC>

 - The government's strategy is Nation Building for Recovery. The government's strategy is to build the economy up; the opposition's strategy is to talk the economy down. That is it in a nutshell. Those opposite are happy to talk the economy down, to tear the economy down, because they have concluded that it might actually boost their political prospects. That is what it is all about.Our strategy is clear. Nation Building for Recovery will support jobs, businesses, apprenticeships and training for today by investing in the nation-building infrastructure we need for tomorrow - nation-building infrastructure which a large slab of those opposite have a particular interest in supporting in their electorates and distancing themselves from here in Canberra. Seventy per cent of the government's nation-building and economic stimulus plan has been targeted towards infrastructure. That means $60 billion is being invested in infrastructure like rail, roads, ports, broadband, solar energy and the biggest school modernisation program Australia has ever seen.The budget alone invests $22 billion in further infrastructure stimulus. The consequence for jobs is that we will support more than 200,000 jobs that would otherwise be destroyed by the global economic recession - 200,000 people whom those opposite, we assume, would prefer to have thrown onto the unemployment queue. Many Australians will be witnessing construction rolled out at their schools across the nation, across our towns and communities, as we speak. I would ask the House to reflect on this number: 35,000 jobs will be rolled out across the country under our Nation Building for Recovery program. I would like to take the opportunity to report to the House that construction is already well underway. For the benefit of the parliament, I can table an updated list of projects which have been approved for construction. I can table, for example - and I will - a folder of projects already approved under round 1 of the Australian School Pride Program. We have projects here from the -  -  - Those opposite laugh at these projects. I thought they were supporting some of these projects. Are they supporting or opposing them? -  - I am about to table them. You have a look at them. I table a folder of projects already approved under round 1 of the Australian School Pride Program. We have got projects for the refurbishment of play areas, car parks and high school lockers at the Macquarie College in New South Wales and for the building of an outdoor learning centre at Palmwoods State School in Queensland, which is just down the road from where the Treasurer and I grew up. Is Palmwoods in the member for Fisher's electorate or in the member for Fairfax's electorate? I presume the member for Fairfax welcomes that investment. I table that particular update. I also table a folder of projects already approved under round 2 of the Australian School Pride Program. If those opposite have an interest in their contents, they can sit down and have a read. We have got projects -  - The member for Fadden would be objecting to projects in his electorate, I assume. The member for Fadden is in the House, standing on his feet now and saying that he does not want any investment in schools in his electorate. - Did I hear the member for Fadden say that he wants no investment in the schools in his electorate? I think I did. I take the intervention from the member for Fadden that he wants no investment in his schools. I table this folder detailing projects from High Wycombe Primary School in Western Australia to fencing and walkways at Moulden Park School in the Northern Territory. - Whilst a member with the call may make a passing reference to a displayed object or article, members without the call may not do so and will be dealt with accordingly.That is the only thing that I am attempting to apply with regard to those that are displaying signs. The Prime Minister has the call. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker -  - I note the intervention by the member for Canning, in whose electorate we are currently investing through the Building the Education Revolution in 159 projects involving 61 schools with an investment of $65 million. Does he want that investment or not? -  - He does want that investment. So he voted against it in Canberra -  -  -  - What we have witnessed in the parliament today is the Liberal and National parties in absolute disarray - a Liberal Party standing up in the parliament and saying, 'Yes, we want investment in our local schools,' and, 'No, we will not vote for that investment here in Canberra.' What absolute rancid hypocrisy! I also table a folder of major rail, road and boom gates and black spots projects across Australia. The Leader of the National Party guffaws, as is his custom. I would have thought that any Nat standing up in this parliament and thinking about the importance of boom gate repair across Australia would, if they were worth their salt, stand up for the good folk of the bush and say that we need this extra investment in boom gates and black spots to enhance security. We have got projects from the western Victoria track upgrade to the upgrade of the Northern Expressway in South Australia.I also table a folder of Australian social and defence housing projects. These are good reading, too. I would draw these to the attention of the member for Herbert, because these are important projects for our men and women in uniform. We have projects from the 28 Defence housing projects approved for Andrews Farm in Adelaide to the refurbishment of 70 social houses in Subiaco -  - I assume that the member for Mayo wants no investment in schools in his electorate. -  - Apparently, the member for Canning does want deficit to support the investment in schools in Canning; the member for Mayo does not; the member for Fadden I think does not; the member for O'Connor does not - or does? What absolute disarray! I also table a folder of Australian community infrastructure projects -  - In fact, hypocrisy is a demeaning condition, I would say to the member for Curtin. We have projects from a half basketball court in Derby in Tasmania to a community workshop facility at Bourke in New South Wales. I table that list of projects as well. On top of that I also table a list of projects, a folder of projects, approved for Australian Primary Schools for the 21st Century. We have projects from a resource centre at Bajool State School in Queensland to the construction of a community gymnasium in Winnaleah District High School in Tasmania. I table this Australian Primary Schools for the 21st Century folder as well. Can I say to those opposite that what we have had in their - The member for O'Connor then left the chamber. - So, in sum, what we have in these folders of projects which are currently underway as part of the government's Nation Building for Recovery program is a large number of investment projects, part of the 35,000 projects being rolled out across the country. Let it be stated formally on the record that the Liberals and Nationals have voted against 20,000 social housing projects, 11,000 projects in primary schools, 802 defence housing projects - Member for Herbert, hang your head in shame - 17 major rail projects, 14 major road projects, 500 black spots projects, 250 boom gate projects - National Party, hang your collective head in shame - and 3,168 community infrastructure projects. The one exception, of course, is if we subtract those projects within the schools area for the member for Canning, because he stood up today and said that he in fact meant to vote with the government when this was actually put through.What we have here is the most appalling display of Liberal Party hypocrisy, underlined yesterday by the minister for infrastructure standing in this place, showing one Liberal member after another and one National member after another attending supportively the launch of local investment projects in local schools right around the country, and piously and hypocritically claiming that they do not support the investment in these projects whatsoever. Is it any wonder that the people of Australia do not believe what those opposite stand for? We stand for building the Australian economy up; you stand for tearing the Australian economy down.</DOC>

 - We have just seen the Hockey plan in action - the Leader of the Opposition sitting there, Mr Hockey behind him, trying to sort of nudge out the member for Higgins, who has been lifting his profile over the last couple of weeks. They are all jostling in there at the moment.Let's get a couple of things very clear. Statement No. 3 in the budget papers outlines all of the methodology for our projections. - The shadow Treasurer wants me to go and do all of his homework; I will take him for a reading lesson later on. It is all there. - What he did just then was outline the scare campaign the Liberal Party wants to run. It is actually not about the projections. It is not about the forecasts. It is about a Liberal Party scare campaign. This government has done the responsible thing. We have had a revenue collapse of $210 billion, which they want to pretend has not occurred. The member for Higgins was in the House last night pretending that the mining boom did not give us a revenue surge - telling everybody how brilliant he was and in the next breath pretending that we had not had a revenue collapse from the collapse of the mining boom. Well, of course we have, and the consequence of that is that we have had to borrow responsibly to support jobs. - We have outlined in unprecedented detail in the budget papers our medium-term fiscal policy, in a way which those opposite have never done. They claimed to be serious about an Intergenerational report and then did nothing about it. So the task falls to us. The task falls to the Labor Party, in the teeth of the global recession, to protect our people by responsible borrowing, by investing in modernising our schools and by investing in infrastructure to support jobs and businesses in our community. What those opposite are so embarrassed about is that, if we take the proposition put by the shadow Treasurer here today to its logical conclusion, what they stand for is higher unemployment and more business failures - because all of these projects that are creating jobs and supporting businesses in our community would not be happening right now. To camouflage their lack of alternatives they have to run this seedy campaign against the forecasts and the projections which have been put forward in good faith by the Commonwealth Treasury.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question, and I note there are 51 projects, worth over $21 million, scheduled in his electorate. Forty-five of those projects relate to schools. I note also that the members of the opposition voted against all of these projects when they came into the parliament. The government is committed to nation building for recovery through building infrastructure throughout Australia, whereas the opposition is committed to opposing this.I note that there have been a number of criticisms of projections and figures in the budget, from a variety of sources but most particularly from the member for North Sydney. Yesterday the government, sadly, was not allowed to describe the member for North Sydney as 'sloppy' in his approach. It is a pity, because that is about the kindest adjective I can think of to describe his performance. Other words like 'inaccurate', 'innumerate' and 'incoherent' might come to mind, because yesterday the member for North Sydney asserted in the parliament that, in order to return the Commonwealth balance sheet to a debt-free position in the time frame projected by the budget, it would be necessary to run surpluses of two per cent of GDP or more for a period of eight years. Unfortunately, he appears to have done this calculation on the back of an envelope on the spur of the moment, and he has missed one very salient point. He appears to have taken the peak number of net debt, divided it by the figure of eight - for the period of eight years - and come up with $25 billion, which of course is roughly two per cent of GDP now. But it will not be two per cent of GDP in 10 years time. Guess what, Member for North Sydney: GDP grows over time - an extraordinary revelation for a would-be Treasurer! -  - Unfortunately, there is, for the member for North Sydney, a very simple explanation as to why the figures in the budget papers show surpluses over the period he is referring to - figures like one per cent of GDP, 1.4 per cent of GDP, 1.6 per cent of GDP or whatever the figure may be - and that is that the figure against which the percentage will be calculated in due course will not be GDP for the year 2009-10; it will be GDP for the year 2019-20.This is not the first occasion that the member for North Sydney has been decidedly sloppy with his attention to detail and figures. We note immediately that in the response to the budget he claimed that two-thirds of the peak in net debt that the government is projecting in the budget was covered by new spending. Unfortunately, he neglected to mention a very important fact - that he did not include all of the government's savings measures in his calculations. And, naturally, he made no reference to the point that the total amount of net debt projected was actually lower than the total amount of revenue loss projected over the same period as a result of the global recession.Finally, I would like to quote something that the member for North Sydney said at the National Press Club last week:When Lindsay promised to bring together all the IT departments under a review and said there was going to be great savings out of consolidation, I notice, and I might be wrong, that in the budget papers there was not one dollar of savings. Out of all that IT bluster and bluff, there was not one dollar of savings.Well, I have bad news for you, Member for North Sydney: you are wrong - you are very wrong. On page 50 of the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers published in February - which, if you were a decent shadow Treasurer, you would be familiar with - there is in fact a set of figures that indicate that there will be savings of over $400 million over four years from the IT savings that the member for North Sydney referred to. If a member of the opposition aspires to be the Treasurer of the nation, they have to do their homework. Being Treasurer is more than just breakfast TV shows and one-liners. It involves detail, it involves rigour and it involves hard work. We have gone from having a shadow Treasurer who copies her work from others to having one who makes things up! That is the standard of performance you get from the Liberal Party in economic debate in this country. If you cannot get your facts right in opposition, you are not fit to run the nation's finances.</DOC>

 - In this dishonest scare campaign on deficit and debt - which is what it is; it is all about talking the economy down; it is not about building the economy up - the core element of hypocrisy is that the member just on his feet before, the member for North Sydney, has endorsed every dollar of the government's deficit and debt strategy. He went out the day after the budget came down and said they would deliver a deficit and debt of $25 billion less than the government's. - It was the member for Sturt, the economic genius opposite, who said that the Asian financial crisis was just as bad as the current global economic recession. In fact, I think he may have said the Asian financial crisis was worse than the current global economic recession. I think the member for Sturt's credibility on this question is non-existent. This is a debt and deficit scare campaign -  - Many of us on this side of the House would always stand up for the integrity of Miss Pat and the entire crew out there on Mr Squiggle. I am sure the member for Sturt has been a keen student of the program over the years.I ask those opposite why the member for Sturt jumps to his feet every time I mention the fact that the member for North Sydney has an identical debt and deficit strategy to that of the government. They do not want to hear it - that is what it is all about. It actually goes to the total heart of the hypocrisy of the opposition's campaign on debt and deficit.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The government's strategy for returning the budget to surplus and for repaying the government borrowing is outlined clearly in the budget papers. Furthermore, what I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, as his question goes to the point of numbers, is as follows. We had the clear articulation of the opposition strategy on debt and deficit on display at the doors today. The Leader of the Opposition was asked the following question, given we are all about specificity on budget numbers: 'What does the coalition regard as an acceptable level of debt?' The answer from Mr Turnbull was: 'The level of debt should be no more than is absolutely necessary.' Then the journalist asked this question: 'What's that, then?' Mr Turnbull's answer: 'Well, it's not a question of a number.'We have had a two-week strategy from the opposition which is all about numbers, specificity and drilling down, and then when asked a simple question on the doors today - 'Come on, Malcolm, what is it?' - the answer was, 'Well, it's not a question of a number.' Can I just say: this is the ultimate bookending of what began with the Hockey doctrine two weeks ago, which confirmed that the Liberal strategy on deficit and debt is equal to the government strategy on deficit and debt, equal -  - Oh! '$25 billion less,' they say and then they refuse to back $22 billion worth of savings. So Joe's position is this. You have a $275 billion Liberal deficit and debt strategy, add $22 billion worth of savings forgone and that equals a $300 billion debt and deficit strategy. That is the Hockey doctrine of two weeks ago. The Turnbull doctrine today says it is not about a specific number. Is it any wonder that nobody actually attaches any credibility whatsoever to this scare campaign on debt and deficit? The opposition have one single objective in mind. The government is building the economy up; the Liberals are seeking to talk the economy down.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for her question. I note that under the Australian government's nation building for recovery plan there are over 157 projects underway in the member's electorate. And there will be an investment of $43.8 million in the member's electorate. There will be 121 projects under the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history. Twenty social housing units will be built in the member's electorate, and there will be 16 projects under the government's black spots and boom gates program, including $950,000 towards the accident prone area of the Kyogle Road at Lismore. There will be $10.9 billion for five local councils under the Community Infrastructure Program, including a $3.4 million investment in the Evans Head Aquatic Centre. These are practical projects aimed at building the infrastructure her community needs tomorrow while supporting jobs, business and apprenticeships today. That is the government's overall strategy in response to the global economic recession, which is ripping the heart out of economies across the world.Secondly, I would like to confirm today to the House that the government through its strategy is providing funding for infrastructure for every one of Australia's 9,540 schools - every one of them. I would like to confirm to the House that under the National School Pride program we will be delivering $1.3 billion to 9,490 schools for 13,176 projects. I also confirm to the House that works on 8,863 projects at 5,994 schools are due to commence this month. On top of that, on 7 May the government allocated $2.8 billion of funding to 2,010 major projects like school halls, gymnasiums and multipurpose centres across nearly 1,500 Australian primary schools. That is the government's strategy on nation building.Yesterday we had some interesting exchanges with those opposite on their responses to nation building in their electorates. I draw the attention of the House to one of our favourite members opposite, the member for Canning - a person given to enormous generosity of spirit. He said at the time when this stimulus package supporting these projects was put through the House:_ I am saying tonight, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that we will not be a part of this.That is what the member for Canning said in February. What did the member for Canning have to say last night? He said this:I support whatever taxpayer funds or funds borrowed on behalf of taxpayers are going into my electorate.What a distance it is -  - How they squirm and turn when presented with the facts. That was a bit like the member for Fadden yesterday: 'Will I, won't I, put my hand up? Put it half up? Put it down? What day is it? Are they watching back home? Are they watching on TV? Are they listening to the broadcast?' It is called being transparent and honest with your community. Either you vote for it or you do not. And those opposite know nothing whatsoever about transparency. -  - I always love Joe's interventions. It is called the Joe Hockey bellow factor - the louder you bellow, the lesser the amount of content lying behind the bellowing. Let us go to our good friend opposite. We will pass by the member for Fadden - he made a notable contribution to the House yesterday, as well, on this. Let us go to the member for Wentworth, who we know as the Leader of the Opposition has a keen interest in local infrastructure as well. We know, when the minister for infrastructure showed up to announce an investment in the Waverley Park pavilion, the Leader of the Opposition had the following to say:Could I just say that I'm delighted that the Government's spending this money on the Pavilion here.'Delighted'. He said:_ I'm delighted to be here to welcome that investment, it's a very good investment in infrastructure.I have a few problems with this. How does that reconcile itself with the huff and puff and bluster we have heard here for the last two weeks? But I can also go on to the question of schools in the honourable member's electorate. Let us just look at a few of these schools. We have St Anthony's school. Does the Leader of the Opposition support the refurbishment of the playground and classrooms and the installation of broadband at St Anthony's school in his electorate? Does he support the refurbishment of classrooms and roofing at St Clare's College in Waverley? What about that one? - During Question Time, a Member may orally ask a question of a Minister (but not a Parliamentary Secretary*), without notice and for immediate response.Contrary to the commentary made to the House -  - The degree of discomfort on the part of those opposite is transparent to the nation. We then come to the question of the Galilee Catholic Primary School, and we would be interested to know whether the honourable member supports the refurbishment -  -  - or reconstruction of the covered learning area at that school or the upgrading of floors, roofs and sewerage at the Woollahra Public School. It looks like a nice school, but I am sure they could deal with the upgrading of the floors, roofs and sewerage. - I noticed that one of the interventions on the part of those opposite referred to 'embarrassment'. Can I just say that what is singularly embarrassing for those opposite is to have to stand before their local communities and say that they voted against each one of these investments in their local schools. That is why they are embarrassed - except for the good old member for Canning, who yesterday in the parliament did a complete backflip with reverse pike and twist. So we have the Kincoppal-Rose Bay School of the Sacred Heart multipurpose hall and performing arts centre - to show that our program is directed to non-government schools as well - the St Francis of Assisi School; the St Catherine's School; and the installation of wireless broadband at St Charles' Catholic Primary School - a very nice school as well. Those opposite said that these questions have been posed to them in a manner inconsistent with the standing orders.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition, on the question of the investment in these very good schools in his electorate, has disputed -  - I am glad to have our good friend Tony Abbott intervening so volubly as well. I know that he stands up for investment in his electorate as well - and, of course, he strongly upholds parliamentary standards himself. - The Leader of the Opposition has objected to a series of questions that have been posed to him about whether he supports investment in each of these schools. He could use the device - and I challenge him to use the device - used yesterday by our good friend the member for Canning, who stood up in this place and said that he supported the investment in his electorate, that he supported the borrowing to support the investment in his electorate and that he supported the schools that were funded as a consequence of that investment and borrowing. The procedures of the House have the facility available for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up at the conclusion of question time and say, on each of these schools that I have presented, whether or not he supports the investment in those schools and the borrowing to underpin the investment in those schools. That is his challenge, pure and simple.</DOC>

 - First of all, can I say to the honourable gentleman who has asked the question that the criterion for the administration of the payment concerned goes to the completion of a tax return in the year that has been specified, which is 2007-08. Furthermore, as the honourable member would know - and the member for Higgins would be fully familiar with this himself - when the previous government implemented low-income tax offset bonuses, they applied exactly the same methodology as has been employed by the government in relation to this matter as well. Therefore, I would suggest to those opposite that they reflect carefully upon the standards they bring to bear in this debate. Can I also say to the honourable member that he should be exceptionally mindful of the circumstances of those who have lost loved ones in the last 12 months. This is a sensitive matter. - The honourable Leader of the Opposition interjects on this point. I would say to those opposite that, for those who have lost loved ones in the last 12 months, this is not an incidental matter; it is of direct and personal concern to them. I would urge those opposite to reflect on that as they pursue this particular line of questioning.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for his question. There are something like 107 projects underway in Makin, something like 102 school projects in Makin, and they are supporting jobs and supporting small business in Adelaide. They are key parts of our nation-building plan for recovery. But, of course, not one of those 107 projects would go ahead if those opposite were in government - not one. These vital jobs, this vital support for business, would not be there and the consequence for those local communities would be higher unemployment and more business failures. It is really that simple. And, of course, that is why those opposite are so embarrassed about the fact that they do not have an alternative fiscal policy, which is why we are getting this scare campaign on deficit and debt.We have put in place through the budget an historic investment in essential infrastructure - road, rail, port - to expand the productive capacity of our nation. Something like 70 per cent of our stimulus is invested in infrastructure, which of course is being opposed by the opposition here, but it is vital in supporting jobs today. Without the government's investment, up to 210,000 Australians would be out of work. We should think about that for a moment. That is the logical consequence of their position.They are our fellow Australians. They are our neighbours; they are our family members; they are our workmates. Those opposite should seriously consider the unsustainability of their position in this House, as has been demonstrated day after day by the Prime Minister and other ministers, because this stimulus through investment in infrastructure is absolutely vital to support jobs. But I suspect there is only one job that the Leader of the Opposition is worried about here, and that is his - only one job. - Well, it is the truth. The only job he is worried about is his own job. He is not worried about the jobs of Australians because he does not walk in the same shopping aisles as average Australians. He certainly does not do that, because otherwise why would he vote against stimulus? If he understood the impact of his decisions to oppose these measures, why would  he vote against stimulus? Because he is chronically out of touch with the needs of the Australian economy and chronically out of touch with the need to support jobs in our community. The only job he is worried about is his own. Naked political opportunism - that is what rules the day. We on this side of the House will go on supporting jobs -  - doing the responsible thing by the Australian economy, while those opposite do the opposite.</DOC>

 - One of the delights about the member for Curtin is originality. One of the further delights about the member for Curtin is spontaneity. One thing about the member for Curtin is that you just need to turn to the pages of the Australian today to work out that you are going to get a question from the member for Curtin, because it says so, that she is going to ask a question on this subject today. Can you picture that 40-member tactics committee of the Liberal Party? Monday, Julie goes in: 'Can I have a question?' No. Tuesday: 'Can I have a question?' No. Wednesday: 'Can I have a question?' No. Thursday: 'It's in the newspapers - I should be given a question.' - One thing almost as enjoyable about one of Julie's angry looks is it is one of Alex's angry looks when Alex used to be in the House - and we miss Alex! - Referring briefly to the former foreign minister, Mr Downer, the current Leader of the Opposition's chief of staff would be entirely familiar with how the former foreign minister dealt with ambassadors in Argentina and elsewhere when they happened to cross the paths of the then foreign minister, but I am sure they could answer for that on their own account. - Consistent with practice which I understand was probably the case with Mr Downer and Mr Howard, the foreign minister and I regularly discuss senior diplomatic appointments. The foreign minister and I agree on appointments which go to the question of which skills are best applied to which of our most senior diplomatic appointments abroad. That applied in the case of the posting which is the subject of this question as well. On the question of Mr Hugh Borrowman, he is a first-class diplomat. The kingdom of Sweden is an important country for Australia. It will soon, as I am advised, assume the presidency of the European Union. We therefore wish him well in that appointment. He will do an excellent job. Furthermore, could I say applying those national interest criteria to appointments was exactly the discussion the foreign minister and I had in relation to the appointment of Mr Tim Fischer as Australia's first ambassador to the Holy See.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and for his bringing of decorum into the House. The member for Braddon would be welcoming the 75 projects in his electorate under the Building the Education Revolution program. I know he is a member who cares very passionately about the state of his local schools and also about supporting jobs in his electorate and would be welcoming those 75 projects, under Building the Education Revolution, which are part of the 93 projects in total in his electorate worth $35.3 million. Of course these projects are just some of the more than 15,000 projects that have been approved through the opening rounds of the National School Pride program and the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. The great unknown about these programs is not which schools have benefited so far but whether or not the Leader of the Opposition supports this expenditure on these schools, a question I hope he clarifies after question time.When he is clarifying that question, he may, during the course of question time, want to look into the galleries above us where we are expecting, during the course of question time and in the House today, to see Sacred Heart Primary School, from the member for Mackellar's electorate; Pymble Ladies College, from the member for Bradfield's electorate; Green Point Christian College, from the member for Robertson's electorate; St Gertrude's Primary School, from the member for Prospect's electorate; and Hornsby Heights Public School, from the member for Berowra's electorate. I would also ask the Leader of the Opposition to note, as he contemplates whether or not he should say he supports this expenditure, that these schools have received assistance from our National School Pride program for things like the refurbishment of classrooms and schoolgrounds, the construction of new shade structures and general refurbishment. I note that individually some of these schools have benefited already under our Primary Schools for the 21st Century program with $2 million going to Hornsby Heights Public School, $3 million to Green Point Christian College and $2.5 million going to Sacred Heart Primary School. This is important national expenditure about the future of our schools and about supporting jobs today. It is expenditure that every member of the opposition voted against. It was consequently with some surprise that I read a media release put out by the member for Bowman on 12 May where he says, having come into this House and voted against this expenditure:11 Redlands schools will receive major building grants worth a total of more than $26 million, Federal Member Andrew Laming announced today.It goes on:I am a strong supporter of any investment in educational infrastructure like language and science laboratories.So he is a supporter of any investment in educational infrastructure when he is putting out a media release in his electorate. What he cannot do is bring himself into the parliament and vote for it when it is under consideration by this House. I know that the surname of the member for Bowman is Laming but I think the behaviour by those opposite would be better caught under the word 'lemming'. Lemmings are rodents famous for throwing themselves over cliffs in herds. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and there is nothing like getting lectured by the party of Wilson Tuckey on parliamentary standards. But of course, Mr Speaker, you would be aware of the myth of the lemming and to quote the ABC science website, 'This myth is now a metaphor -  - As the website says, 'This myth is now a metaphor for the behaviour of crowds of people who foolishy follow each other lemming-like regardless of the consequences.' Well, who does that remind you of, Mr Speaker? I think the lemming-like Liberal Party of Australia.</DOC>

 - They can never get fired up about jobs in local communities. They can never get fired up about the people who are being cushioned against the global recession. What we just saw was the Hockey $300 billion debt. That is what we saw. He has admitted, and the Leader of the Opposition has admitted, that in the circumstances that this country finds itself in they would have to borrow as much as the government will have to borrow and they would not pay it off one day sooner. That is what they have confirmed, because if they are not confirming that, where is their alternative plan? What is the alternative fiscal policy? That is their alternative fiscal policy: a blank piece of paper. They have no alternative fiscal policy because they know that this government has had forced upon it, and this country has had forced upon it, a $210 billion revenue collapse. If they were going to do something different, what they would have to do is savagely increase taxes or savagely cut back services. They come into this House and will not nominate one saving they could make. What that means is that they would borrow every cent the government has borrowed and they would not pay it back one day sooner. They are complete frauds.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I notice that there are 392 projects underway in the member's electorate - projects supporting jobs and small businesses - as part of the government's nation building for recovery plan, the plan that is committed to building Australia for the future and which the opposition continues to vigorously resist, carping negatively about Australia's economic prospects.The government has a long-term strategy as well as a short-term strategy of stimulating activity in the economy. It also has a long-term strategy to return in Australia to a strong productivity growth pathway. There are three central elements to this strategy: investing in infrastructure, investing in skills and reforming regulation. They are the key items in the government's strategy to lift the productivity performance in the Australian economy, which has been inadequate for a number of years. Central to this has been the investment in infrastructure that forms part of the stimulus package that the government has put forward for the Australian people to boost economic activity.The opposition does not accept that investment in infrastructure is crucial. It is happy to participate in local photo opportunities, it is happy to be part of the picture in the local paper, but the opposition is not prepared to support infrastructure investment when it comes to voting in this chamber. It has always puzzled me somewhat as to why the opposition is not prepared to support nation-building infrastructure. Indeed, it puzzled me for nearly 12 years when they were in government as to why they were not prepared to invest in infrastructure for Australia's future. It has always puzzled me. Given the astonishingly juvenile performance we have just witnessed from the opposition, perhaps I should not be that puzzled. But I can tell you this, Mr Speaker: yesterday I got a little bit of a hint, a little bit of a clue, as to why the opposition does not support investing in infrastructure, because in Senate estimates hearings yesterday the shadow minister for finance, Senator Coonan, asked a question of public servants. The question she asked was this: 'What is infrastructure?' That was her question. She then followed up with a question: 'What is your definition of infrastructure?'The problem the opposition has is that they do not even know what infrastructure is. That is why they do not support it. The government is committed to investing in infrastructure. It is committed to lifting the productivity performance of the Australian economy, which for too many years languished under the now opposition. For too many years they did not invest in infrastructure and skills and they did not seek to reform Australia's regulatory structures and, as a result, Australian productivity performance languished. The Australian government knows the importance of investing in infrastructure. Australian business knows the importance of investing in infrastructure. Indeed, the wider community knows the importance of investing in infrastructure. Senator Coonan, I remind the House, was not a minister for a portfolio with nothing to do with infrastructure; she was the minister responsible for broadband. The minister responsible for broadband has to ask, 'What does infrastructure mean?' That gives you some indication, Mr Speaker, of the true depths of ignorance and complacency and lack of regard for the long-term productivity development of this nation that the Liberal Party opposition represents. The Australian government, the Rudd government, has a very different perspective. We regard investment in productive infrastructure as central to the economic future of this nation - in broadband, in ports, in road, in rail and in skills. They are the central drivers of long-term prosperity for the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley for that question and note that already some 140 households in his electorate have applied for either the insulation rebate or the solar hot water rebate under the Rudd government's plans. The member's constituents join over 50,000 Australian households which have already accessed the Energy Efficient Homes plan, which is part of the $42 billion Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. I also note that the member for Chifley's electorate is home to the Fletcher Insulation plant in Rooty Hill, where the insulation production is going through the roof.That is what the economic stimulus package is about. It is about making sure that we have jobs - jobs that are created in the local community - and, at the same time, rolling out the largest energy efficiency program that Australia has ever seen. This package from this government will deliver energy efficiency to around three million Australian households over the next three years. This is an ambition well beyond any previous energy efficiency program in this country. It is a mark of the Rudd government's commitment to getting on with the business of supporting jobs that we are seeing this program deliver so quickly right across the nation.I saw some comments earlier this week from US Secretary of Energy, Dr Stephen Chu, who said: 'The quickest and easiest way to reduce our carbon footprint is through energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is just not low-hanging fruit. It is fruit that is lying on the ground.' The government could not agree more. It is well overdue that we begin to harvest that low-hanging fruit because the previous government were asleep at the wheel for too long on this issue. I can report to the House that the Energy Efficient Homes call centre has already received more than 83,000 calls since February - 27,000 Australians looking to install ceiling insulation and 23,000 Australians looking to install solar hot water. This is all before the rollout of components. The full rollout starts on 1 July. - I will come to the member for Flinders later on. I am glad he has made that interjection, because I will come to him later on. - The Bradford Insulation Group have informed my office that they are adding to employees on the manufacturing side alone by some 55 people. That does not include additional jobs in call centres and warehousing. Just last week as well Fletcher Insulation announced an $8 million upgrade to its Victorian manufacturing plant and the extension of its Dandenong and Rooty Hill plants to 24/7 production. That is the Rooty Hill plant in the electorate of Chifley where I understand that, prior to the Energy Efficient Homes package, there was some consideration of rationalising operations. Now they are going 24/7. Fletcher Insulation has also announced the creation of 50 jobs as a result of this increased demand.What are these jobs about? With Fletcher Insulation these jobs are about pink batts. It is not just about pink batts of course - it is about green batts, it is about polyester, it is about glass wool, it is about rock wool, it is about cellulose, it is about natural wool and it is about foil. If it meets the standards, you can install it under the Energy Efficient Homes plan. But of course pink batts is the product that is so often maligned by the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, who takes every opportunity to ridicule an investment that is already supporting Australian jobs and saving Australians' energy bills. 'We would not have had the pink batts,' the member for North Sydney says, and he goes out of his way to run down the most cost-effective energy efficient improvement that Australians can actually apply at this time, and it is one that produces jobs.The opposition leader is fond of getting up in the House and saying that it is all about jobs, jobs, jobs, but I saw a weekend report in the Sydney Morning Herald pointing out that when he was environment minister he actually wanted to roll out a program of ceiling insulation around Australia, as this government is doing, but he was blocked by the member for Higgins just as he is being blocked by the Nationals on an emissions trading scheme. I think this says a lot about where the opposition is at because they are voting against and publicly ridiculing measures, and some of these were the same measures that the Leader of the Opposition wanted to introduce when they were in government, but he was not able to.The government is delivering. It is providing leadership on an issue that produces green-collar jobs, which produces the largest energy efficiency program that has ever been rolled out in this country. It supports and assists Australians in reducing their energy bills; it is taking care of cost-of-living pressures and providing real leadership in the infrastructure of this country; and it is helping people to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</DOC>

 - What we have here is another smokescreen from those opposite to try and camouflage the fact that they do not have an alternative fiscal policy. The member well knows that net debt is projected to fall to 3.7 per cent of GDP by 2019-20. But what this is all about is to cover up their embarrassment for not having an alternative fiscal policy and for not being able to articulate anything about it either in this House or outside. - On the doors yesterday we got a real insight into the predicament of those opposite. We had the member for Bowman doing an interview and this is what he said in answer to this question from a journalist: 'What level of debt is not too high?' Laming: 'There is no level of debt that is too high or not too high.' Journalist: 'What do you regard as an acceptable level of debt?' - I was asked about debt and I am talking about debt, absolutely. This is what the member for Bowman had to say this morning when asked by a journalist, 'What do you regard as an acceptable level of debt?'Member for Bowman: I won't name a number.Journalist: Give us a number.Member for Bowman: No numbers, no numbers. - As hopeless as that sounds, it was then taken up by another member of the opposition this morning. It was taken up, in fact, by the Leader of the Opposition. This is what he was asked this morning -  -  - Mr Speaker, this was what the Leader of the Opposition was asked this morning: 'What does the coalition regard as an acceptable level of debt?' The Leader of the Opposition -  - Mr Speaker, I am talking about debt and about the Leader of the Opposition this morning when he was asked, 'What does the coalition regard as an acceptable level of debt?'Leader of the Opposition: Well, the level of debt should be no more than is absolutely necessary.Journalist: What then?Leader of the Opposition: Well, it is not a question of a number.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and thank him for joining me in his electorate on 19 May when we launched the defence healthcare trial in Cairns. He is a strong supporter of the defence community and he was with me as we delivered on another election promise from the Rudd government. I note also for the member for Leichhardt that, under the Australian government's nation building for recovery program, there are 236 projects in his electorate, projects that are supporting jobs and small businesses in suburbs such as Woree and Redlynch.As we know, this is a part of the government's program of nation building for recovery, supporting jobs, business and infrastructure for Australia's needs for tomorrow. Of course, we know that, if the Liberals had their way, not a single one of these projects would commence. You would be aware also that, as part of this nation building program and as part of the government's decisive action, we announced expenditure of $251.6 million in funding for Defence Housing Australia. This is to construct 802 dwellings for Australian Defence Force personnel and their families in metropolitan and regional centres.I am pleased to be able to announce that DHA have made significant progress since this announcement. Nationwide, over 260 houses have been contracted to date, tenders for over 650 houses have been issued and major site works have begun on over 180 houses. Unfortunately, though, as ever, the opposition has not supported this measure. The following members are significant. The member for Herbert, the member for Hunter, the member for Mayo, the member for Gilmore, the member for Groom, the member for Indi, the member for Flinders and the member for Gippsland all voted against Defence Force families having new homes built in their electorate. -  - Of course, I meant Paterson's curse, not the member for Hunter. Unfortunately and sadly, while these members say they advocate for Defence Force families, they failed miserably when it came to the opportunity to show their support by voting for this investment in this chamber. No doubt, as we have known, they will be shameless in attending any ceremonies celebrating the handover of the new homes.Of course, we expect them to carry placards. Those placards should say, 'We are here in body but not in spirit because, unlike the members of the Labor Party, who have Defence Force families in their electorate, the provision of this additional housing for Defence Force families and the job and business opportunities it creates, we do not support.' That is what they have done by voting against these proposals in this chamber. Yet I note that the member for Herbert got up earlier this afternoon and spoke about the need for people to stand up for regional Australia. I ask the member for Herbert: when is he going to stand up for the people of regional Australia? When is he going to stand up for the people of his electorate? The fact is that he voted against it. The member for Herbert then left the chamber.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He legitimately points to the difficulties which have been experienced recently in the Richmond-Tweed, Clarence Valley and Mid North Coast on the back of natural disasters but also, more broadly, on the impact of the global economic recession on the communities which he represents. Therefore, he legitimately raises questions of what can be further done in his area.I was speaking with the Minister for Employment Participation about the member's area recently as we looked at unemployment data from across the country. The member represents an area which, from recollection, looking at the data from April, is north of eight per cent - 8.3, 8.5 per cent. Therefore, in terms of those priority areas which the government is seeking to address additional efforts to at the moment, it would, from our point of view, qualify for further consideration by way of additional assistance. In my discussions with the Minister for Employment Participation we have agreed that this should be designated as a priority employment area - that is, the area of the Richmond-Tweed, Clarence Valley and North Coast. We would also confirm to the honourable member in response to his question that we will proceed with the appointment of a priority employment coordinator for this area as well.The particular mechanism that the priority employment coordinators are deploying across the nation is to engage with local communities, their business leadership, their community leadership, their local government leadership and local church and charitable organisations and to work together to come up with practical projects which could form the basis for further investment from the community jobs fund, which is a fund that we provided support for in earlier allocations from this parliament nationwide of some $650 million. In response to the announcement of that fund we also made it clear in statements from the government that in our Jobs and Training Compact with Australia we would be implementing compacts with young Australians, compacts with those Australians who have been retrenched through no fault of their own and compacts also with local communities. This particular program comes off the back of compacts with local communities.In the seven areas that we currently have designated around the country we have already, together with the Minister for Employment Participation, addressed local community seminars about practical projects which could be supported. Further, in conversations with the minister recently I understand that in response to the first round of seeking applications from the community at large we received more than 3,000 applications - I am looking for a prompt from the minister here -  - 3,000-plus applications from around the country. Therefore, there will be further rounds which will be sought for expressions of interest from local communities. I would invite the honourable member and other affected local members in this region to work with the priority employment coordinators, once they are appointed, on particular projects which will have effect in their area.What I would say more broadly about the challenge of unemployment is that, as the global recession has deepened and the recession has inflicted damage on the Australian economy and on the workforce more generally, it underlines again the absolute importance of a nation building for recovery program of the type which the government has outlined in this parliament over the last two weeks and prior to that as well. That provides an additional injection of activity in the economy. Again I emphasise something which the Treasurer correctly put to the House before, which is that in the absence of the government's action to date - through, firstly, our stimulus payments in October last year; secondly, the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which was released in February this year; and, thirdly, the measures contained in the budget - the 200,000 jobs that we are providing support for on the back of those investments in the Australian economy for each of the two subsequent years would otherwise be lost. That is a huge number in the overall dimensions of the size of the Australian workforce. Therefore, what we have sought to do on top of that is to provide additional support, in particular areas of intense unemployment activity, through the application of local jobs funds.I therefore thank the honourable member for his question. I would encourage him, together with the member for New England, the member for Page and the member for Richmond in terms of the particular area we are speaking of - Page, Richmond, Lyne and other affected areas - to work closely with the local employment coordinator and get applications in for what will work locally to try to bring that unemployment rate down a further notch compared with what it would otherwise be, building on the back of the nation building for recovery plan that the government has outlined comprehensively in the parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question because it goes to the health of the whole Murray-Darling river system and it goes to what investments we are making in that system for the future in order to deal with the fact that water allocations across the Murray-Darling have been excessive not just for years but for decades. The challenge on the part of any responsible government of Australia is what action you can take to take some of that pressure off the system.In response to the honourable member's question, I say that all honourable members in this House should ask themselves one question: how many litres of water entitlement did the previous government buy back in their 12 years in office? Zero. Twelve years of rhetoric on the Murray-Darling, 12 years of rhetoric on taking pressure off the system, but not one gigalitre, not one litre of water entitlement was ever purchased back from the system in order to take the pressure off the Murray-Darling. That is the record of those opposite. I seem to recall that the Leader of the Opposition, at a certain stage in his political career, was also the minister responsible for water. Again, this is parallel to what we have seen on climate change, there were a lot of statements of rhetoric at an earlier time, but when the rubber hits the road and he is required to do something to actually deliver an outcome - be it on climate change, be it on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, be it having occupied a ministerial position able to purchase back entitlements from the river system - not one litre of water entitlement was ever purchased back.This government is a government of action; this government has committed to assist in taking pressure off the system. I would like to confirm to the House today that the Australian government is buying almost 240 gigalitres of water entitlement for $303 million from the Twynam Agricultural Group. This represents the single largest purchase of water entitlements for the environment in Australia's history. That is what we have done in this decision today, announced by myself and the Minister for Climate Change and Water.Once again, we hear barracking from the National Party. The National Party actually calls the shots within the coalition on water policy and climate change. - Yes, it is the tail wagging the dog once again. The National Party says, 'We're not going to do anything on climate change'. What does Malcolm Turnbull do? He collapses in a heap. What does the National Party say on buying back water entitlements? 'We're not going to do anything on that'. Malcolm Turnbull collapses in a heap. - It is always a delight to hear from the former member for Mayo's replacement in this place. What we have is a clear indication of government action: 240 gigalitres purchased for $303 million. If you add that to what we have also purchased back, this government has purchased 300 gigalitres of water entitlements to take pressure off the system. I would say to those opposite -  - Again the member for Flinders seeks to intervene; again a stellar parliamentary career of great achievement when it comes to delivering real results - nothing. This government has acted to buy back water entitlements of nearly 300 gigalitres. Contrast that to not a single litre of water entitlement purchased in their 12 years in office. Why? Because it is the National Party that controls the coalition on this. The National Party dictates the shots. Any leader worth his salt would stand up to the National Party. The current leader does not.This investment is part of the government's $12.9 billion Water for the Future program. Under this Water for the Future program, it provides $3.1 billion for the purchase of water for environmental purposes. Also, our water purchasing program is complemented by a $5.8 billion program for infrastructure investment to improve water use efficiency. These are practical decisions to take pressure off the system. For the benefit of those opposite, let me just say what 240 gigalitres actually amounts to: it is the equivalent to one half of all of the water used in Sydney in a year. I heard the minister for climate change say this morning that it is in excess of what the city of Adelaide takes off the Murray-Darling system each year. These are not small numbers, these are large numbers. This government takes seriously -  - Ah, the Leader of the National Party intervening again. How many gigalitres of entitlements would the National Party have us buy back? I cannot hear anything! Once again what we have is the National Party parading itself in this place as the tail that wags the coalition dog on both climate change policy and water policy.In this place, when we are debating serious questions of climate change and its most direct impact - that is, what is happening to the once great Murray-Darling river system, what is happening to the Great Barrier Reef and what is happening to Kakadu - what we need in this parliament is leadership. What we need is leadership from the Liberal Party on water and on climate change so that we can make a difference in the Senate. What we have is the Leader of the Opposition, who has on these hard questions of policy squibbed in the face of the right-wing ideologues within his own party and within the National Party more broadly. As a consequence they stand ready in the Senate to vote down measures on climate change that would make a difference. This government is about making a difference on climate change and water. Those opposite are simply captive to the National Party and the climate change sceptics within their own ranks. We have a plan of action for the Murray-Darling; those opposite have nothing but a litany of excuses for inaction on the Murray-Darling. The contrast is clear for all to see.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question. She is always interested in steps that can be taken to protect the community. Obviously the Prime Minister and I went through a number of steps that the government has already taken to tackle this problem in question time yesterday, but there are some further developments today that I would like to keep the House abreast of. Before I do that, I advise that we now have 103 confirmed swine flu cases in Australia. The number has jumped significantly overnight. In the course of that time we have also seen the number of new cases increase, for example, in the United States by a thousand and in Canada by an additional 200. The disease has got to a point where the numbers are increasing fairly significantly around the country and we can expect, unfortunately, to see more of that in the coming days.I advise the House that there is a significant change to a number of circumstances that members might need to be aware of. Whilst most of the 103 people who have been confirmed as having swine flu have been experiencing mild symptoms, we do now have four people who have been hospitalised - two in Victoria who presented with quite severe conditions but who are both recovering well, one young man in New South Wales whose condition is improving and one case where we still do not have confirmed details as there seem to be other unrelated complications with that person's circumstances.There has also been a lot of focus on the situation of the cruise ship Pacific Dawn that has been up in Northern Queensland. In addition to the comments that I made earlier, I can advise that the Queensland government and P&amp;O have now announced that an agreement has been reached for the ship to dock in Brisbane on Saturday and return to Sydney on Monday - three days early. This agreement has been reached in order to ensure that passengers can still spend some of their time having their holiday safely on the boat and can get support, if any is required, at these two major ports. Three crew members have tested positive to swine flu. They have all been receiving Tamiflu from the commencement of the trip and do not believe, as I have been advised, that they have been in contact with other passengers. No passengers have currently tested positive to swine flu, and P&amp;O do advise that passengers will be compensated for the shortening of their trip. We obviously thank P&amp;O for their cooperative actions and, of course, want to join them in apologising to passengers whose holidays might have been disrupted. I think the public health advice is to ensure that this disease, which is not yet in Northern Queensland, can be isolated for as long as possible from parts of the community that do not have any cases.The government has taken an important step to further protect the community today. We have placed an order with CSL for the purchase of the swine flu vaccine. This vaccine is expected to be developed in the next couple of months. We have a priority agreement with CSL which has been activated, and this means that we will be placed high in the queue to be able to receive this vaccine once it is able to be produced by CSL. We have placed an order for the purchase of sufficient doses for 10 million people. That is based on the current expert advice that this is sufficient to contain the spread of the disease and also to protect those at risk of any complications. Of course, further work will continue while the vaccine is being developed as we have further evidence in Australia of particular groups that might be more vulnerable.CSL is currently working fast to develop the vaccine. It will need to do clinical trials. It will register with the TGA to ensure that the vaccine is safe. In the past fortnight, we have also purchased an additional 1.6 million courses of Rolenza for the stockpile, which means that we are building on our existing supply in the stockpile. We will have 6.9 million courses of Tamiflu, 1.8 million courses of Rolenza and the additional purchases that I have just announced - meaning that we will have 10.3 million courses of antivirals in our stockpile. I advise that the first requests for Tamiflu have been made by the states and territories and that the first release of Tamiflu from the national medical stockpile has commenced. The Chief Medical Officer authorised the release of 7½ thousand doses of paediatric Tamiflu suspension for Victoria and Western Australia and 10,000 packets of Tamiflu to Victoria. This is of particular importance because the paediatric version needs to be used for very young children. In Victoria, where we are seeing the disease spreading more quickly than in other communities, that is to ensure that they will have a sufficient supply. I understand that Western Australia did not have a large supply of paediatric Tamiflu and, although they have only one case confirmed, they wanted to make sure that they had some on hand if the situation develops.We will continue to consider requests as they come in. We have already taken steps to ensure that the stockpile is not being held just in Canberra but that it can be readily made available to state and territory authorities, if and when they need them. The Chief Medical Officer will take account of the different circumstances in different parts of the country in making a decision about whether the stockpile should be used and will look at the number of cases, the spread, the epidemiological advice and the availability of medicines in the states and territories.These medicines will be dispensed by state public health officials in line with agreed national guidelines. It is important to remember that this means that Australia is very well placed to handle this situation. The community does need to be prepared for the fact that there will be an increased number of cases, probably significant, in the coming few days. Members can continue to give support to the public by reminding them that there is no need to be alarmed but there is certainly a need to be vigilant. It is important to provide advice to people to see their medical professional if they are experiencing any flu symptoms, particularly if they have travelled to countries at risk or believe they have been in contact with any confirmed cases.</DOC>

What we have said - and this is the case - is that we will continue negotiations with the New South Wales government on those matters that have been identified in that correspondence. I am happy to report to the House that those negotiations are ongoing. I also want to make it perfectly clear to the honourable member opposite that no stopwork order has been issued.

 - I thank the member for his question. Since coming to office the government has been working very hard to increase Australia's engagement across a range of countries in a range of regions. Regrettably, when we came to office we discovered that there were many parts of the globe, many regions, where there had been considerable inattention so far as Australian foreign policy and activity had been concerned. That is why, for example, we have moved very quickly to establish observer status with the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, a very important south Asian regional group which includes India and Pakistan. That is why I attended the African Union Summit in January this year - the first Australian foreign minister to do so. That is why before the end of this year we will start our strategic dialogue with the Gulf Co-operation Council - the GCC - across a range of trade, strategic and security matters. That is why last year we established a modern framework for the basis of the relationship between Australia and the European Union with the presentation of the European Union-Australia Partnership Framework.I am very pleased to advise the House today that Australia has taken additional steps to deepen our engagement with both Europe and Asia. The Asia-Europe Meeting process, or ASEM as it is known, brings together 16 Asian nations in the ASEAN secretariat along with 27 European Union nations and the European Commission. ASEM was inaugurated with the first ASEM leaders summit in Bangkok in March 1996. Australia, some members will recall, applied for membership in 1996 but we were unsuccessful. We applied again at the 1998 leaders summit but were unsuccessful. Regrettably, no further efforts were made for a decade to get Australia into that important regional organisation, deepening and broadening our engagement with both Asia and Europe.At the ASEM meeting in Beijing in 2008 - the first after the government came to office - Australia applied for membership. The government put forward Australia's name. I am pleased to advise the House that in Hanoi this week Australia's application to join the Asia-Europe Meeting process was welcomed by ASEM foreign ministers. Once arrangements have been effected to formalise the detail of Australia's membership, Australia will join ASEM at the next leaders summit, ASEM8, in Brussels next year. Our participation in that process reflects the government's very strong commitment to deepen and broaden our engagement both in Asia and in Europe. It also reflects the modern basis of our relationship and engagement with Europe, just as it does our strongest possible commitment to our friends and colleagues in Asia.Membership of the Asia-Europe Meeting process will make our engagement with both regions stronger. This is a very positive and welcome development and it is one, frankly, which has overcome a decade of inattention and inactivity which has not been in our national interest. Despite that lack of activity and interest over a 10-year period, our membership of ASEM from next year at the leaders summit in Brussels will enable us to more appropriately and effectively advance our national interest both in Asia and in Europe.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for the question. The ABARE modelling is now available on the costs of doing nothing on climate change and the costs of action. As members are well aware, there is no cost-free option in either direction. The modelling on what would happen to Australian agriculture if Australia were to do nothing on climate change was released more than a year ago. It contains export figures for commodities, which are alarming to say the least. If we were to do nothing, our wheat exports would take an 11 per cent hit by 2030 and a 15 per cent hit by 2050; our beef exports would take a 29 per cent hit by 2030 and a 33 per cent hit by 2050; our sheepmeat exports would take a 15 per cent hit by 2030 and a 21 per cent hit by 2050, our dairy exports would take a 19 per cent hit by 2030 and a 27 per cent hit by 2050; and, most alarming of all, our sugar exports would take a 63 per cent hit by 2030 and a 79 per cent hit by 2050.That said, taking action would not be without costs either. The costs are real. They were referred to by ABARE the other day in Senate estimates, and I think it is important to advise the House of those figures now. By 2011 the costs at the point of processing, which include the impact of on-farm inputs and the inputs by the time you get to processors, would be $1.83 per head of cattle, 17c per head of sheep, 61c per tonne of grain and $4 per head for the average dairy. These costs are real. They are small compared to the costs of not acting. Nonetheless, there are significant costs in acting. That is why the government, through the Climate Change Research Program, is determined that scientific research in this space will find the areas where we can get alignment between improvements in productivity and a reduction in emissions. While each of these models presumes that there would not be any improvements in technology, the government, by more than tripling the money originally promised for the Climate Change Research Program, is determined to make sure that these issues can be aligned.I was also asked about the threat to a response on climate change. The threat to the government being able to respond through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme lies very clearly in the coalition's behaviour in the Senate. When the Leader of the Opposition first took on that role, some people were reasonably confident that we would end up with a constructive approach and that we would not actually end up seeing a significant threat to action on climate change. That was until this week came around. If ever there was any evidence that the Leader of the Opposition had become a threat to action on climate change it was before a word was spoken when he appeared side-by-side with the Leader of the Nationals at a media conference. It is not unknown for a Leader of the Opposition to go searching for a power base when times are tough - to go to powerbrokers or to try to get a base of support - but the National Party? This is a group of people who not only disagree fundamentally with the views put forward by Leader of the Opposition on this issue but also cannot agree with each other.The member for Wide Bay said on that very day that the Nationals wanted to take a constructive approach to these issues. Yet the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate had these words on a constructive approach: 'The answer is no. There you go. No, no, no, no, no. Okay.' That is the constructive approach of the National Party. One member of the National Party was reported on 6 August as saying he is prepared to out himself as a climate change sceptic to bring a voice of reason to the debate. Another member of the National Party, in a media release last Monday, described climate change as a massive threat.The concern about the 'massive threat' as opposed to the 'climate change sceptic' is this: I was actually referring to the same member of the National Party. It is the same person, the shadow minister for agriculture, who is both the climate change sceptic and the person who believes climate change is a massive threat. The National Party will never want to act on climate change, and the Leader of the Opposition at the moment has caved in entirely to the sceptics. At least there is an opportunity now, though, to show some leadership. The opportunity for leadership is there, at least in terms of the local electorate, to stand up as requested at the end of question time and let us know whether or not you support school funding in your own electorate.</DOC>

 - I find it an unusual question from a Leader of the Opposition who, when asked about debt, recently said, 'The number doesn't matter.' I find it remarkable that the Leader of the Opposition can stand in the parliament and ask a question about numbers on debt when, in answer to a direct question on the same topic, he said, 'It isn't a question of number.' Furthermore, I would draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the fact that the member for North Sydney, in answer to a question about what the Liberals' debt strategy would be, said that it would be $25 billion less than the government's. The government's debt strategy is outlined clearly in the budget papers. We are responding to the worst global recession in 75 years. Our strategy will be implemented.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I note that those opposite take every opportunity to talk the Australian economy down. I note also that government members are doing everything within their power, through the government, to build the Australian economy up. That is why we are implementing a nation building for recovery plan.In the final quarter of last year, the global economy virtually fell off a cliff. That is what happened in the events of Lehman's week in September-October last year, when we saw economies right around the world and financial institutions within those economies begin to reel. We saw what followed in terms of the consequential growth performances of economies around the world. Our response, our nation building for recovery plan, saw us act immediately on the question of providing fiscal stimulus for the Australian economy and in particular support for the 1½ million Australians who work in the retail sector. Then there was the implementation of our infrastructure investment plan, which supports jobs and businesses today by investing in infrastructure for tomorrow. Seventy per cent of the government's economic stimulus is being invested in infrastructure through our nation building for recovery plan.The Australian government, through implementing these policies, has had an effect in cushioning the impact of the global recession on Australia so far. That is why Australia is doing better against most economic indicators than most other economies around the world at present. We still have many challenges ahead of us, and we intend to confront each of those challenges as it arises.What is interesting on the part of those opposite, as they engage in the debate about deficit and debt, is that never once have the words 'global economic recession' passed their lips. It is as if the global economic recession has simply disappeared from reality; it is as if this country alone is faced with the challenges that have been brought about by what happened in the critical events of the last quarter of last year. For the benefit of those opposite, growth in the 30 OECD economies fell on average by 2.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2009. Twenty-three countries have fallen into this global recession. They include Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. Twenty-nine of the 30 OECD -  - Twenty-nine of the 30 OECD countries have experienced at least one quarter of economic growth. As I have said to the House before, eight of Australia's top 10 trading partners are currently experiencing recession. This is the worst global economic recession that we have seen in three-quarters of a century. Therefore, it directly affects Australian jobs, it affects Australian business and it affects the Australian economy. Australia's growth in the fourth quarter of last year was negative 0.5 per cent. This was substantially stronger than the average of negative two per cent across the OECD. Australia had higher growth than all of the major advanced economies in the December quarter and was the sixth highest across the entire OECD. The average growth of all OECD countries that have already reported their March quarter GDP was negative 2.1 per cent, and markets are already expecting a negative quarter for Australia when data is released here on Wednesday. I challenge those opposite again to actually use the words 'global economic recession' and to understand that in the fourth quarter last year Australia performed relatively well against most other economies. In the first quarter this year it was negative 2.1 per cent, and the Australian government has been taking a range of active measures to cushion the impact of the recession on Australia.I draw the attention of honourable members in the House to the fact that data on retail sales for April was released today. It showed that retail sales rose by 0.3 per cent. I repeat: retail sales rose by 0.3 per cent. Let us put this into context since the global economic recession hit in the fourth quarter last year. Since the government introduced its stimulus packages, first of all last October and then again in February, we have seen the flowthrough effect in terms of real activity in the economy. Honourable members should focus on these figures: Australian retail sales are now running at 4.8 per cent above their levels for November last year - 4.8 per cent above. Every person - every one of the 1½ million Australians working in retail - will be pleased by those numbers. They are numbers which do not seem to feature at all in the public political discourse on the part of those opposite, who, as I have said before, have an interest in talking the economy down at every opportunity. The numbers for Australia - 4.8 per cent above the levels of November last year - contrast with the 1.1 per cent fall across the major advanced economies over the same period. In Japan, retail sales fell by three per cent. US retail sales fell by 2.9 per cent and Canadian retail sales fell by 2.7 per cent.Further data out today relates to company profits. Company profits in Australia fell by 7.2 per cent in the March quarter but are still 6.8 per cent higher through the year. Again I draw the attention of honourable members to the performance of the retail industry within the company profits data. While profits declined in most sectors of the Australian economy, the strongest growth in profits of all industries was recorded in the retail trade group, which rose by 15.5 per cent - 15.5 per cent. I also draw honourable members' attention to recent statements by major Australian retailers about the additional staff they are putting on in the retail sector around the country.As they engage in a rolling strategy in the House and outside the House of talking the Australian economy down, I say to those opposite that when they do so they should reflect on the positive data which has emerged here on retail sales and the performance of our principal retailers. They are part and parcel -  - The measures the government has adopted through its national economic stimulus strategy and nation building for recovery - supporting jobs and business and apprenticeships today by investing in the nation building infrastructure we need for tomorrow - are helping this economy recover, given that we have enormous challenges bearing down upon us from the global economic recession.This is the worst recession this country has seen in three-quarters of a century because of what is happening with the simultaneous downturn in economies right across the world. The government's strategy is clear: nation building for recovery. We intend to build the economy up. I appeal to those opposite, both in this question time and beyond, to change their tone and to engage in some positive language - not simply to go negative all the time and talk the Australian economy down, because the Australian people expect and believe better of them and this parliament.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I assume this is the same program that our good friend the member for Canning spoke about the other day and said that he supported. He said he supported both the borrowing and the investment in projects like this in his electorate. Is that right? I seem to have heard the Leader of the Opposition say today that he also supported investments in electorates of some type. I just want to see what exact type he is referring to. But, remember, with the Leader of the Opposition the core organising principle is that it is not a question of numbers. I go to the question just posed by the Leader of the Opposition on signs and plaques. The amount referred to equates to 0.02 per cent of the $14.7 billion investment in Australia's schools under Building the Education Revolution. - Under the Investing in our Schools Program guess how much those opposite spent on the question of commemorative plaques? How much do you think you might have spent, Julie? In a total program of $1.1 billion, guess how much our Jules spent on plaques and overall announcement strategies? They spent $7.1 million out of $1.18 billion, which actually equals one per cent of the total program. That is 50 times the amount that this government is proposing to spend on this particular program. Those opposite once again have been caught out by their own extraordinary double standards. We have a nation building for recovery plan; those opposite simply intend to talk the economy down at every opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question because I think he has a detailed understanding of the importance of economic stimulus and nation building. -  - Mr Speaker, it is understandable how negative the opposition have become. They do not understand the importance of 277 projects on the ground in the electorate of Solomon. They do not understand that at all. They do not understand the importance of 72 school projects and the importance of 185 defence housing projects. They do not understand that because they do not understand the importance of economic stimulus in the worst global recession in over 75 years. We are in the middle of a situation where virtually every advanced country has gone into recession or has gone backwards.Australia is not immune from these circumstances. The truth is, as the Prime Minister said before, 'We are weathering the storm much better than many other countries.' Of course, one of the reasons that is the case is the economic stimulus this government has put in place. We understand the importance, when the world contracts so sharply, of putting in place economic stimulus to support employment in local communities and to support local businesses, which is why it is so pleasing to see today the retail trade figures.Retail sales rose by 0.3 per cent in April, which means sales are now running at a stunning 4.8 per cent above their levels of November last year. That is when our first stimulus package began to flow. The Prime Minister said that our positive 4.8 per cent since November compares with minus three per cent in Japan, minus 2.9 per cent in the United States and minus 2.7 per cent in Canada over the same period. This is a boost, which is very important as the Prime Minister said for the retail sector itself, but it flows right through the economy. It flows right through and keeps people in jobs right across the supply chain. Those opposite do not understand the importance of this to people who work in transport, such as truck drivers. They do not understand the importance of this to people who work in warehouses and so forth. What these figures do show is how important economic stimulus is to support employment.Had we not acted as quickly as we did last October and had we not acted as quickly as we did last February we would not be seeing these sorts of figures. Of course, we have the national accounts data, which will be out later in the week. We know that for the March quarter things did get worse globally through that quarter. Japan's economy -  - I am talking internationally. Things got a lot worse during that quarter internationally. - He probably missed it, Mr Speaker. He probably missed the fact that Japan's economy shrank by a massive four per cent, the worst performance since records began in 1955. The UK contracted by 1.9 per cent, its worst performance since 1979. Germany contracted by 3.8 per cent, its worst since 1970. Of course the US contracted by 1.5 per cent, France by 1.2 per cent and Italy by 2.4 per cent. Somehow those opposite want to pretend that this country is completely immune from those events. They want to pretend that there is no impact in this country at all. We understand the importance of that, which is why we have put in place the first phase of our economic stimulus with cash payments to households. It is why we have put in place shovel-ready projects investing in homes and schools.Whatever the outcome on Wednesday there are two things that we know for sure. The first one is that things would be much worse if we did not act to stimulate the economy and the second one is that those opposite were wrong - absolutely wrong - to vote against the measures to support jobs in this House. Of course we have seen the Leader of the Opposition all over the television in the last 24 hours talking the economy down. We heard no mention of a global recession, not one mention of the challenges imposed on us by the world and no mention of nation building for recovery. All we got from the Leader of the Opposition was complete opportunism, because he has one big priority: it is for the economy to fail so that he can succeed. That is how negative he has become. Usually leaders of the opposition are called alternative prime ministers but not so with this one because he has no alternative policy whatsoever, none whatsoever, and the negative approach we have had from those opposite demonstrates how unqualified they are to deal with this situation. We will go on with cushioning our economy from this global recession and supporting employment, and those opposite are only going to be negative.</DOC>

 - That is absolutely stunning coming from those opposite, who would not invest in infrastructure in this country for 12 years. When we finally stump up the money and put in place plans for the future they get up and say, 'Why haven't you spent more?' while simultaneously saying to us that we should not borrow to build the nation. How stupid can you people be? It is unbelievable. How stupid can you be? The Leader of the Opposition goes on national television and says that, in the middle of the worst global crisis in 75 years, the country should not be borrowing money to protect our people. That is effectively what he said. And he is saying in those negative ads where he talks the economy down he will not acknowledge we are in the middle of a global recession and he will not acknowledge the important need for -  - Well, it was a question about borrowing and, of course, what I was referring to was the stunning hypocrisy of the member and all of those opposite when they sit in the House and pretend that no borrowing is necessary to protect our people, when we have seen evidence in the retail sales figures of how important economic stimulus is. This question of borrowing got a bit of an airing yesterday on Insiders and this is what Mr Cassidy said to the Leader of the Opposition. He said, 'How much less would borrowing be?' - I certainly am responding to the question about borrowing, Mr Speaker. I am being directly relevant. The Leader of the Opposition was asked about it yesterday on Insiders. He was asked how much less the borrowings of those opposite would be. The Leader of the Opposition said it would be a lot less. And Mr Cassidy went on:_ if you could give us a very precise idea about how much less. - The honourable member talked about a black hole. If there is a black hole it was left to us by the opposition - absolutely! The $60 billion that they are claiming is a gap was left to us by them. - On Insiders yesterday this is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say. -  - Are you that embarrassed by it? Are you that embarrassed by his performance yesterday? He was asked by Mr Cassidy -  - Mr Cassidy:_ if you could give us a very precise idea about how much less.The Leader of the Opposition:_ it isn't possible _</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for a question about infrastructure. That is something that I have not had - not a single question on infrastructure - from those opposite, all year. Indeed, since I have had the portfolio I have had one question, which was a year ago, from the shadow minister for infrastructure, and that was about how many staff Infrastructure Australia had. There has not been one question, even though infrastructure forms the centrepiece of the budget - the centrepiece of nation building for recovery. And part of the budget is the Nation Building Program, which those opposite are prepared to vote against in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. The Nation Building Program will provide record funding of 120 road projects and 26 rail projects. The Nation Building Program will provide funds to fix dangerous black spots around the country and will pay for the installation of boom gates at high-risk level crossings and the construction of additional rest stops for truck drivers.Just before question time we had a division. It was a division between those people who support nation building and infrastructure development and those people who do not. The National Party and the Liberal Party, once again, chose to vote against nation building. They did that on the basis that the Leader of the National Party - who has assigned himself to the back bench in shame, I notice - suggests that this is not providing funding for regional Australia. Well, have a look at the facts. The facts are that $21.2 billion of this spending is being delivered for rural and regional Australia. Some $1.2 billion on top of that is being invested in the ARTC. That is a total of $22.4 billion for rural and regional Australia.Now, if you look at the former government's AusLink program you find that its total funding - the whole lot - was $17.1 billion on national road and rail infrastructure. In total, $17.1 billion was their funding under the AusLink program. Last time I looked, 22 was a bigger number than 17! They provided $17 billion for the whole nation; we are providing $22.4 billion for rural and regional Australia. But the opposition had two lots of amendments that they voted on earlier today. One arose from the argument that the Strategic Regional Program that they had, only applied to regions. - The argument that the coalition put is that the Strategic Regional Program was just for regions and that somehow the Labor government is trying to take money away from the regions and put it into the cities. Let us have a look at what the opposition actually did under the Strategic Regional Program. The best example, perhaps, of their Regional Strategic Roads Program was that it provided $2 million to upgrade Campbell Parade, Bondi Beach, in the electorate of Wentworth. The only way you could head further east would be to by getting wet - with scuba gear - because Campbell Parade was in the marginal seat of Wentworth in the lead-up to the election.But it was not just in the seat of Wentworth, of course. Bennelong - now finally represented by the member for Bennelong - received three lots of funding: the upgrade of Balaclava Road, the upgrade of Cox's Road and the upgrade of Wicks Road. So what those opposite did with the Strategic Regional Program was fund roads in regional Australia and in marginal electorates. That is what they did. That is what the opportunists opposite did.The opposition amendment, which they all voted for, was opposed to the off-network projects that will be funded by the Rudd government - 41 projects worth $655 million. The member for La Trobe voted against $30 million to upgrade Clyde Road in his electorate. Congratulations! We will be letting them know, Member for La Trobe. The member for Stirling came into this parliament and spoke about the need for more road funding in his electorate, but he voted against the $10 million interchange upgrade on the Reid Highway and Alexander Drive. That is part of the legislation. He complained about it but comes in and, when he has the opportunity, votes against it. Once again, he is doing one thing in the electorate and another thing here in Canberra.They also had a second amendment that they all voted for, which was about the Black Spot Program - the Black Spot Program that we have more than doubled. What they did there was move an amendment saying that the Black Spot Program should not apply to the national network. The Black Spot Program projects are identified by a committee. That has not changed. The committee consists of motoring organisations and safety experts, and projects are identified on the basis of accidents. It is not a political process at all. That is the way that projects are identified, and 81 projects on the national network have been selected for the Black Spot Program so far - 81 projects that were opposed by those opposite. Let's look at the politics of this: 43 of the 81 projects that they voted against are in coalition electorates, 33 in Labor electorates and five in electorates held by Independents. They voted against this program. The opportunism is extraordinary. Once again, the member for Gippsland has provided us with some really good material, because the very program that I identified -  - The member for Gippsland -  - The member for Gippsland, I informed parliament last week, had a photograph in his local paper in an article in which he welcomed the upgrade of, as he put it, 'one of Traralgon's most dangerous intersections' under the Black Spot Program. He went and got his photo taken there with the local representative, Mr Peter Wood. He looked at the upgrade plans and he said:These upgrades will help to make the intersection safer and improve traffic flow along the highway and through the Central Business District.He praises it in the electorate, he gets his photo taken in the electorate and today he voted against funding of that Black Spot Program. We will hold those opposite to account for their voting record. They cannot come in here and oppose funding for their own electorates, particularly road funding for black spots, move this ridiculous amendment put forward by the Leader of the National Party and then purport to support it in their own seats. They do one thing in Canberra and another thing in their electorates, and their opportunism - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I know that he understands the importance of investing in infrastructure for his local community and for supporting jobs. I know that he, in his local electorate, would be welcoming the 118 projects representing $34.8 million of investment. These projects include 95 projects under the Building the Education Revolution in 38 schools at a total of $23.5 million of investment - investment supported by this side of the House and opposed by the Liberal Party.Our investments in education, in jobs today and in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow, are of course investments in schools, but they are also investments beyond schools. So far this government has committed $5.1 billion in infrastructure for tertiary education and research. This includes an investment of $4.065 billion from the Education Investment Fund. As part of this investment in jobs today and in the education infrastructure we need for tomorrow, the government announced a range of successful projects as parts of rounds 1 and 2 of the Education Investment Fund rounds of investment. The Education Investment Fund round 1 contained $580 million for 11 successful projects at universities across the nation and the EIF round 2 announced funding of $934 million for 31 successful projects that will improve the tertiary sector and develop our education infrastructure and research capacity.Just describing one of these projects I think may assist the opposition because it may make clear to them two concepts they appear to be struggling with. Concept No. 1: if the government steps forward to do investment in infrastructure it can be joined by others who want to partner in that infrastructure development. It is clear from the questions being asked by the opposition today that that concept has completely eluded them. Concept No. 2: if you are investing in infrastructure then you are supporting jobs in construction, but if you are investing in infrastructure you can also be supporting jobs for the long term. Let me explain this for the opposition around a particular project and, hopefully, they will manage to cotton on.Let us look at the University of Sydney's Centre for Obesity, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease - obviously, a research centre looking at some of the biggest killers of Australians, some of our biggest health challenges. The opposition might want to note and have a little think about this. The University of Sydney, to develop that centre, received a $95 million grant through the Education Investment Fund, but it leveraged additional funding, having received that grant, so the cost of the project is $385 million in total. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says she understands this. She needs to explain it to her shadow minister for infrastructure, who clearly, from his questions, does not. This investment of $385 million in total - because of the Education Investment Fund investment and because of the leveraging of funding from extra sources - will, according to the Chairman of the Education Investment Fund, support 2,000 jobs through the construction. But beyond that, when the building is finished, it will house 330 staff. What this means, according to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, Professor Don Nutbeam, is that there will be a 10 per cent increase in the number of staff in order for there to be the people to work from this brand-new facility. You could not get a better example of what economic stimulus in the form of infrastructure can do: jobs today through construction, jobs for the long-term through the people who will work in the building; government investment leveraging private sector investment; government investment and private sector or non-government investment working together to create a facility which will address some of the major contemporary challenges for this nation in terms of the health challenges of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Members opposite, day after day, come into this House and oppose infrastructure. In doing so, they are opposing vital projects like this one. They are opposing the jobs in construction; they are opposing the long-term jobs the facility would mean; they are opposing the additional investment that the government dollars are leveraging: a completely catastrophic economic formula for the nation.</DOC>

 - It is very clear that we have a medium-term fiscal policy. We have put in place a framework of responsible economic management, and those opposite have none - absolutely none; no alternative fiscal policy. They are unable to admit that the global recession has had a dramatic impact on this economy and other economies around the world. They are unable to admit that we are doing far better than just about every other advanced economy in the world. They are unable to admit that we have been impacted upon dramatically by the contraction, particularly in this region. And, when it comes to debt, they are unable to admit that ours is amongst the lowest in the advanced world. So what we have got over there is nothing more than an old-fashioned scare campaign from a group of people who do not have an alternative policy framework, who want to talk the country down - who want to spend thousands of dollars on television talking the country down - and who want to skate through to the next election, thinking they can do it without an alternative fiscal policy. Well, they cannot, and they will be condemned for it.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know that, under the Australian government's nation building for recovery plan, there are 53 projects underway in his electorate, at a cost of $21.6 million, and I know that he is very happy to have that investment in his electorate. That includes 45 projects under the largest school modernisation program in the nation's history, across 40 schools in the Deakin electorate, and $2.9 million for the redevelopment of the Ringwood Soccer and Multipurpose Sports Pavilion. I bet that has been a very popular move in your electorate, Member for Deakin. These projects are supporting jobs and small businesses in suburbs like Ringwood, Mitcham and Blackburn, and it is part of this government's strategy of nation building for recovery. If the Liberals had their way, not a single one of these 53 projects would have gone ahead. The contrast is very clear: we are building our economy up; the opposition are talking it down.A couple of weeks ago, when I visited Bayswater North with the member for Deakin, I was able to see the direct effect of some of our repairs and maintenance spending on social housing. In fact, 66 homes are being repaired in Deakin, at a cost of $410,761. While I was at Bayswater North with the member for Deakin, I met Rick Kuyken, who is the managing director of a family business, local builders C&amp;M Kuyken. He works there with his dad, and they have been in business together for many years. Rick's company recently won a contract to repair 15 homes in the Bayswater area - very important to them at this time to get that ongoing work. The house that we visited was being painted and having the guttering replaced, the trees were being trimmed, an old shed in the backyard was being replaced with a new one and new drainage systems were being put in. On the day I went, there were carpenters and painters at work, including a young apprentice who was putting new wiring on the screen doors. Mr Kuyken told me: 'At the moment I've got roughly three big contracts on the go. Usually at this time of year we're a bit quiet - ' - but now there's a lot more jobs out to tender.' I hear the Manager of Opposition Business is saying this is a waste of time - talking about jobs in Australia is a waste of time. - Well, you might think that jobs are a waste of time, but over here we are very concerned to know jobs -  -  -  - I was recounting to the House what Mr Kuyken told me about his business, C&amp;M Kuyken: 'At the moment I've got roughly three big contracts on the go. Usually at this time of year we're a bit quiet, but now there's a lot more jobs out to tender. I've put on another two carpenters and an extra apprentice, who started work two weeks ago. I've also put on another four to five painters over the last three months because of all the work around.' This is a small family business, a small local business. This is the effect for their business of the government's stimulus package.This is a story that is being repeated across the country. I have been talking to builders in inner-city Brisbane, Western Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, south-east Melbourne, right across the country, and these people are putting people on instead of laying them off. That is not to say that things are not still tough in the construction area; of course they are. But imagine how tough they would be if this package had not gone through. Imagine how tough they would be if we were not building 20,000 new homes and fixing up almost 50,000 homes in social housing spending alone. - It is terrific to have a housing spokesperson who opposes investment in housing. Mr Speaker, this week we have received reports from states and territories that as at the end of April repairs and maintenance had been completed on almost 10,000 homes - 9,073 homes, individual dwellings - and work had commenced on a thousand more. That work is right across Australia. We know that the opposition voted against building more social housing dwellings. They voted against the repairs and maintenance and they voted against the jobs that are delivered by this work. The government has taken strong and decisive action to support infrastructure building for the future and support jobs today, and it would be great if the opposition got on board.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. I note that he has 92 projects worth $33 million underway in his electorate, including the North Penrith commuter car park worth $5 million, which, if I remember correctly, the member has lobbied me about in the past rather vociferously. So it is good to see that that is underway. In terms of the government's agenda for building the nation and infrastructure, obviously the wider structure of the budget and the longer term framework of both tax and spending are fundamental to that. Indeed, reforming Australia's tax system to maximise efficiency and equity in that system is a central component of the government's longer term approach.You will recall the Henry review that is currently examining our taxation system, which has a discussion paper out and is engaging in a variety of consultation mechanisms. The Secretary of the Treasury, Ken Henry, made a speech at the National Press Club and there is a variety of public debates going on about some of the specific options. We are not the only ones, of course, who are engaging in consideration of Australia's options for future taxation systems. Indeed not so long ago, when a backbencher, the Leader of the Opposition put out a tax options paper. In fact, according to the member for Higgins at the time, there were 280-odd options in that paper. Treasury analysis indicated that the Leader of the Opposition's preferred option would have seen $100,000 a year in tax cuts flow to people earning more than $1 million a year, contrasting with about a $600 a year tax cut for those on average weekly earnings of about $50,000.I note today in an article by Glenn Milne in the Australian that it would appear that the opposition is undergoing a variety of other considerations with respect to the options for Australia's future taxation system. Indeed, early on in its term in opposition the then shadow Treasurer, now Leader of the Opposition, commissioned Henry Ergas to provide options and advice with respect to the future of Australia's taxation system. Parts of this advice are revealed by Glenn Milne in the Australian today. Amongst the proposals floated to the opposition included flattening the tax rates of the income tax scales and ultimately moving to a flat tax arrangement over 15 years. It also advises that these proposals were presented to shadow cabinet in June or July of 2008 and it was decided by shadow cabinet at the time, according to an unnamed Liberal frontbencher, to:_ let it out on a day when all the focus was on Labor with an immediate disavowal of some of the more controversial elements.Does that sound familiar? I have got a faint echo of a few words ringing in my ears. Does 'never, ever' remind anybody of anything? The strategy that is being unfolded by the opposition has a very familiar little ring to it. Yet again we have a secret tax plan. We have an endeavour to squirm into office, to slink into office, not revealing the true agenda on taxation to the Australian people.We also have a common thread running through the GST package, through the tax cuts that were provided by the then Howard government, through the tax proposals being advocated by the Leader of the Opposition when he was a backbencher, and most particularly through the proposals being considered by the opposition and obviously that were adopted by the opposition in the wake of the Ergas review. That common thread is simple. They all favour higher income earners. They all favour the wealthy at the expense of working people who pay the bulk of the taxes in this country. Now they are working on a secret plan for flat tax rates, which mean one very simple thing: wealthy people pay less and working people pay more. That is what flat taxes mean.This kind of stuff is always dressed up in fancy rhetoric like 'aspirations' and 'incentives' and all this kind of stuff, and people who criticise it are always accused of the politics of envy and class warfare and all of that sort of stuff. All it demonstrates is the simple, single, Liberal Party motto. It is all code for that motto: show me the money! That is who the Liberal Party represent. That is what they represent.Yet they are always reluctant to stand up publicly and fight for the aspirations and the incentives that they purport to represent. I note also that the Milne article indicated that the then Leader of the Opposition, now member for Bradfield, decided not to release the report because it might make people think that they were on about providing tax free kicks to the wealthy. I wonder why that would be the case. I note that, according to the article, the Leader of the Opposition apparently has now taken to calling this Ergas paper a 'theoretical issues paper'. I wonder why he would be describing it in those terms.All this points to a single fact - that is, the Liberal Party has not changed its spots. I call on the opposition leader to tell us about his secret flat tax plan, to release the report and tell the Australian people, the good working people of this country who pay the bulk of the taxes and who would have to pay a lot more if flat tax was introduced into the income tax system. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to tell the Australian public about the flat tax plan that he has up his sleeve for after the next election.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. Perhaps now they have managed to work out that they actually voted on the amendments prior to question time. Maybe they worked out what they actually voted on before. What they voted on was indeed the off-network road projects. The shadow minister complains about the electorates that are funded. Perhaps the member for Calare is opposed to the North Orange Bypass - $10 million. Perhaps the member for Wannon is opposed to the $600,000 that is going into the Warrnambool Intermodal Terminal. Perhaps the member for Murray is opposed to the Shepparton Intermodal Terminal. Perhaps the member for La Trobe is opposed to $30 million going into the Clyde Road. - Perhaps they are opposed to the $60 million that is being provided for improved access to Esperance port in the electorate of Kalgoorlie or the upgrading of Hepburn Avenue in Northern Perth in the electorate of Cowan. Perhaps they are opposed to the Tasmanian projects, including $15 million for the Kingston Bypass in the electorate of Franklin. The member for Franklin supports that project. The members on this side support every one of the projects that we have just voted for. Those opposite have voted against each and every one of these projects by moving the amendments. They voted against the projects in the division that took place prior to question time. Not only do they not know anything about policy development, infrastructure development and nation building but also they know absolutely nothing about the procedures in this House. They want to not only dissociate themselves from the way that they voted on the $42 billion package but also dissociate themselves at 20 minutes past three from what they did at two o'clock. It simply does not stack up in their own electorates.The fact is that we have put forward $35 billion in nation-building transport infrastructure. We have made sure, when it comes to the Nation Building Program, that we have $26 billion from the Commonwealth, matched with $6 billion from states and territories - all up delivering nation-building infrastructure right around the nation. Those opposite know that the majority of that Nation Building Program funding is actually in coalition electorates - the majority of the funding that they are so offended by, because they are just offended by infrastructure development. Those opposite believe it should all be left to the market. That is why, after 12 long years of coalition government, we are busy repairing the infrastructure deficit that we inherited, we are busy creating jobs, we are busy stimulating the economy and we will continue to nation build into the future.</DOC>

 - The government is dealing with the challenge of climate change by a range of measures, one of which is the introduction of legislation in support of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. - Thank you for the sceptic already jumping into the debate 12 seconds after commencing my reply to the question - but he represents a wider constituency than O'Connor, I sense. Acting on climate change is important not simply because Australia needs to act to protect the Great Barrier Reef, not just because we need to act -  -  - I notice honourable members from Queensland seem to be interjecting that they do not want to see the Great Barrier Reef protected. Is that right? They do not want to see Kakadu protected. They do not want to see action to protect the Murray-Darling. The government take these challenges seriously, which is why we must act nationally and internationally on climate change. That is why our Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme proposes to reduce carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020, unconditionally; to reduce carbon pollution by 15 per cent by 2020, if there is an agreement where major developing economies commit to substantially restrained emissions and advanced economies take on commitments comparable to Australia's; and to reduce Australia's carbon pollution by 25 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020, if the world agrees to an ambitious global deal to stabilise levels of CO2 equivalent to 450 parts per million.That is the government's strategy, that is what we have embraced and that is what we intend to get on with doing. That lies at the heart of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This is necessary also to provide business certainty. At a time when the global economy is under such stress and the national economy is also under stress our business community needs certainty, which is why, for example, Andrew Peterson, from PWC said last week:The certainty of the signals being provided over the last few months has now dropped away. The momentum is lost for business and that is a concern just as we are seeing international activity speed up.And Katie Lahey, from the Business Council of Australia, said on 6 May:To drag on the debate whilst we have got this global financial crisis is just one more complexity that business has got to factor into its planning cycle _That is what business is saying across the country. They want certainty; they want certainty for the future. We need certainty in terms of action on climate change and we need certainty also for the business community. The attitude adopted by the Leader of the Opposition on this is of direct relevance because it goes to whether or not this proposal obtains passage through the parliament per medium of the Senate. It was on this matter that the Leader of the Opposition was asked the question point blank yesterday on Insiders: 'Are you still in favour of an emissions trading scheme?' to which the Leader of the Opposition said:Yes Barrie, I am._ yes, I've got no doubt we will have an emissions trading scheme in Australia. That's my view.The opposition leader's express target is five per cent unconditional, and then you go up the range to 15 and 25. It begs the question: if you are supporting a five per cent unconditional target and the other targets of 15 and 25 are unconditional, why on earth don't you support legislation now? Where is the logic that underpins the proposition that you have actually got to postpone this until after Copenhagen. If the five per cent target is unconditional and the government's target is unconditional and the other targets beyond that - 15 and 25 - are conditional on the global outcome at Copenhagen, then why on earth does the Leader of the Opposition advance a logical proposition which says that he cannot support legislation now? It simply does not add up as a matter of policy logic. What it does add up to support is a matter of political expediency, because it goes to what is actually happening within the coalition at present.Firstly, there is the attitude of the National Party. Remember that the Leader of the Opposition has said that his position is that he supports emissions trading. That is his policy. The Leader of the Nationals in the Senate was asked this question today and said that Malcolm Turnbull does not have a policy. He said, 'Only Kevin Rudd has a policy,' and added, 'I haven't seen Malcolm Turnbull's policy'. That was his first proposition. He then went on to say that he hoped dearly that the Liberal Party does not support an emissions trading scheme. He then said - and this is not just your average 'Nat'; this is the bloke who runs the Nats up in the Senate, where the numbers are -  -  - Well, if you listen to what Barnaby says privately about you, mate, it is somewhat less flattering than what you have just referred to about me. Barnaby obviously speaks to us more than he does to you, mate. Then, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate - your colleague, Mr Truss; oh, he has left the chamber - said:An ETS in the middle of this recession would have to be the most ridiculous piece of policy that you could possibly go forward with.That is what the National Party are saying in the Senate. The Leader of the Nationals in the Senate is saying: (a) the Leader of the Opposition does not have a policy on emissions trading and (b) if he does have a policy on emissions trading then the National Party could not possibly support it because you could not possibly proceed with it as this time. That is the split with the Nationals. Then of course you have got Boswell, who said that the National Party would not be supporting it 'under any circumstances'.Then we go to the Liberal Party. We go back to our good friend the member for O'Connor, who came out today and once again underlined what the position of the climate change sceptics, who obtain such a majority in the Liberal Party party room, is. This is what the member for O'Connor said - as he readies himself with the standing orders, the quote, Wilson, is as follows:I, and the majority of the Coalition party room, say it will not work, it will not deliver carbon emission reduction.That is the position of not only the member for O'Connor but, he says, the majority in the coalition party room. Why, therefore, is the government's legislation -  -  - This must be the first time the member for O'Connor has not taken a point of order. So the National Party says that the Liberals do not have a policy on climate change and the Nationals say that, if the Liberals did have a policy on climate change, they would vote against it. The Liberals, represented by the member for O'Connor, say that the majority of the joint party room oppose whatever it is that the Leader of the Opposition is on about. What does all this boil down to? It boils down to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition knows that he should be supporting this legislation - he said that it is five per cent, 15 per cent, 25 per cent, the same as the government's. What it actually says is that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the courage to take on the climate change sceptics within his own party and within the coalition party room. In fact, as was revealed on radio last week in an interview on AM:_ a Liberal insider says a sizeable chunk of Coalition members of parliament - at least a third - would like to vote for the Government's scheme now; that they opted for the delay strategy in order not to destabilise Malcolm Turnbull's leadership, buying him some time to unite the Opposition _Thank you, the member for Flinders, for that briefing to the AM program - I assume it was probably him given that he is just so on song with what is generally happening on their side.This is a serious matter that goes to business certainty; it goes to whether or not this legislation passes the Senate; it goes to the question of whether or not the business community can make confident investment decisions in the future; and it goes to whether or not the renewable energy industry as well can now invest in its future around a secure proposition about a carbon price. What we have seen with the Leader of the Opposition is not leadership. We have seen nothing but rank opportunism. My challenge to him in the national interest is: be positive, take on the sceptics on your own side and get behind the government's program. The national interest demands it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I know that he would be working with students and others in his electorate to get out to them the full facts and the full picture about the government's student financing changes. I want to make a simple point to the member because I know that he is someone who is very concerned about making sure that, when we are restructuring and investing, we are doing that in a way that benefits people on lower incomes and that is fair to people on lower incomes. I am sure that, like me, he was concerned when he saw the conclusion of the Bradley review that the current structure of student income support was leading to money being received by people whose household incomes were right up the income scale - and I am talking about $200,000, $300,000 and $400,000. I am sure he would agree with me that, rather than have money going to families with household incomes of $300,000 and $400,000, he would prefer to do better for ordinary Australians who were trying to send their kids to university.For those Australians who are trying to send their kids to university, the government's changes have made a substantial difference to the families who will be eligible. One of the problems with this debate, and one that the member may have experienced in his electorate, is that under the Liberal Party the family income test became so low and so unrealistic that many students received the message that the only way of getting student income support was to credential themselves as independent and go through the work test. Many students actually believe that that is the only way of getting student income support. Actually, the primary way of getting student income support is being in a family where the family income range qualifies. On that, we have made a very substantial difference. I will give one example, for a family with two students of university age. Under the Liberal Party system, their ability to receive student income support cut out at a family income of $75,000. We have increased that to $139,000, meaning thousands more families are in the income range and thousands more students will receive student income support.Yes, I understand that this required us to deal with the work test because, in order to deal with the matter in a budget-responsible way, these changes are cost neutral. We are saying to students - and I am very happy to work through the individual examples in the electorate of New England and with members who are genuinely interested in benefiting students in their electorates, as opposed to making cheap political points - that we are very happy to work through the circumstances of students. I believe that, when we do that, the member will find that many of the students who currently think that they are ineligible will - on a genuine look at the new family income test - find themselves eligible. I say to the member for New England: if they find themselves eligible for student income support under the new family student support income ranges - and many will - it means that they will automatically be eligible for the student start-up scholarship of $2,254 dollars per year. If they need to relocate in order to study, they will also be eligible further the relocation scholarship, which is $4,000 in the first year and $1,000 each year afterwards. I will be very happy to work through that.Of course, I am not happy to listen to the opportunism of the opposition, whose shadow minister for education said on 25 March, and I quote his words exactly:If the Government is serious about reform, then come Budget time we should see some consideration given to reforms suggested by Bradley in student income support - to ensure that sufficient support is going to those who need it.These are the words of the shadow minister for education and, in their opportunism now, they seek to deny those words. If the Liberal Party want to go out and defend the current system with its skew to people who earn $200,000, $300,000 and $400,000 a year, we would say simply, 'That is what the Liberal Party does; it always seeks to benefit those better off at the expense of the vast majority.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lowe for his question. I know he has a real interest in this issue. It is critical for our environment and critical for our economy that we reduce carbon pollution. This is why the Rudd government has a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in place, proposed to be dealt with by this parliament, and why we are also bringing forward complementary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Last Friday, I addressed the National Business Leaders Forum on Sustainable Development and heard more of the leadership that Australian business and industry are showing on climate change. The message from that leadership forum is very clear: they want action on climate change and they want investment certainty for a low-carbon future. This forum is the same forum that produced a special call for action on climate change in 2007. The call for action was directed at the opposition, who were then in government, who were not willing to pick up the cudgels and actually take climate change seriously.I have to say that we are heading back to the dark old days when on one side you had the climate change deniers and on the other side you had the would-have-beens and the could-have-beens. The problem with the opposition is that they have nothing to say about green collar jobs. This morning, I launched the second phase program guidelines for insulation in the energy efficient homes package. That has been a classic example of taking the right public policy decision to provide stimulus for the economy, which produces jobs and increases capacity for jobs and at the same time enables Australians to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and reduce their energy costs as well. Here we have already more than 100 jobs created by Bradford and Fletcher Insulation facilities, with an investment in Dandenong of some $8 million, which I reported to the House last week. This is the stimulus plan at work. But the opposition have nothing positive to say about it. They have nothing positive to say about the opportunities presented by Pacific Hydro, who last week called for the parliament to ensure passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.They also have nothing to say about jobs at risk through inaction on climate change. I noticed that the opposition laughed when the Prime Minister made reference to the Great Barrier Reef and the Murray-Darling Basin. I was mystified by the opposition laughing at something which is so fair dinkum serious. For those opposite, the risks to the Great Barrier Reef are not only to the environment but also to employment. The Great Barrier Reef generates employment for around 60,000 Australians. The risks to the agricultural sector in the Murray-Darling Basin are not only about the risks to the basin because of climate change impacts - even though they are real risks, which they continue to deny - but also about risks to employment. The Murray-Darling Basin generates employment for around 90,000 Australians. This fundamental connection between protecting the environment and ensuring employment and jobs is something that the opposition just does not seem to get.It is much harder for the Leader of the Opposition to get it when he has the Nationals in the Senate and the Nationals on the front benches here not wanting to delay the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme but simply wanting to oppose it. At a time when business is looking for certainty and action and when the community is looking for resolute action on addressing climate change, it is painful to watch the opposition and the opposition leader when the coalition continues to distance itself from any meaningful action, from taking climate change seriously and from supporting a carbon pollution reduction scheme. I feel some small sympathy - and I say 'small sympathy' - for the member for Flinders. - One thing that I am confident about is that the interjection will not have been his position on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. On 17 July last year, after the green paper was released he rushed out - as he does - and he said, 'Basically, what they, the government, have done is dusted off the document we had.' In other words, the line of the member for Flinders, if I understood it, was to say that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was actually their carbon pollution reduction scheme. You had better speak to the member for Wild Bay -  -  - The member for Wide Bay; actually, what you hear from the Nationals is wild - I stand by that. He ought to be speaking to the member for Wide Bay, because his view about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is that it is probably the harshest that is under consideration anywhere in the world. It cannot be the scheme that you were proposing and the harshest scheme anywhere in the world at the same time.The fact is, if you want to be taken seriously on climate change, if you want to secure our environment into the future, then you need targets and you need a plan to achieve them. If you believe in something, you need to vote for it. In the absence of that belief and conviction from the Leader of the Opposition, this government will get on with the business of securing the environment and employment with a carbon pollution reduction scheme and the positive policy measures that go with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. This is indeed a very serious and very important matter. I will outline to the House the matters in relation to this incident. Early in May, I asked the accreditation agency to undertake a major investigation of the home's handling of the incident and to report to me within 30 days in relation to that. The agency commenced its investigation on 6 May and has just about completed its investigation. So far, they have visited the home, interviewed a range of people and sought expert advice in relation to the incident.The agency's investigation was to consider but was not limited to: the home's management of the plague, including the actions taken and the timeliness of actions taken; how the home responded to incidents in which the residents were affected; and actions taken to protect the residents generally. The investigation is to consider the actions of the home as well as the actions of the approved provider, Darling Downs West Moreton Health Service, part of Queensland Health. The report should also include recommendations to improve the procedures and processes for the protection of those residents. The independent accreditation agency has also visited the home, which is, as I said, run by Queensland Health. The Department of Health and Ageing is in regular contact with the home. As I said, that report will be coming to me very shortly.This is a very serious matter. My main concern is for the safety, health and welfare of our residents in our nursing homes right across this nation. We have 2,830 nursing homes, which are home to nearly 200,000 older Australians. Our main priority is our commitment to them. I will have that major investigation report very shortly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question and for his longstanding interest in matters relating to veterans. The budget builds on last year and continues reforms by this government and, particularly in the area of pension reform, sees some major movement forward. People are aware of the detail of the Harmer review in terms of payments.With respect to the Veterans' Affairs portfolio, we are talking about $1.1 billion over the next four years for pension payments. This will benefit 105,000-plus war widows and 320,000 across the board in the portfolio. It also includes nearly 200,000 service pensioners and partner service pensioners. All of these will benefit in the same manner as those pensioners under the aged category with respect to the benefit from Harmer in terms of its graduated fashion.Carers also benefit dramatically in this area with respect to the new carer payments: $35 million over five years to the 16,000 carers who relate to the care of veterans and their families within our portfolio. In addition, it is important to remember the TPIs, who are our most injured veterans - those who have suffered most with respect to the impacts of war. Roughly 80 per cent of those will be impacted by these reforms and will in fact gain the benefits that others in the community will on the basis of their income circumstances beyond their compensation. I think that is also good news for many of our most injured war veterans. That is all up as part of a budget of $11.8 billion across the portfolio: a record $4.9 billion with respect to health care and, in the context of compensation and income support, $6.5 billion.In that context, with respect to mental health care for ADF members and also those who are now veterans, I also mention the circumstances are - in combination with the reforms from the Dunt reports - $92 million over four years: $83 million in the Defence portfolio and $9.5 million with respect to improved service delivery within the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Of course, there are a large number of investments that are being made in rural health. There is one in particular I am surprised the member has not taken the opportunity to ask a question about - I will get to cataracts - because she is one of the members opposite who came to see me about a range of issues in her electorate. I welcome members always being prepared to do that. She particularly asked about the shortage of doctors in her electorate, which will be significantly aided because of the rural health investments - the new structure that is being introduced to support people who are moving to regional areas. They will be paid more the more remote they go. If my recollection is right, GPs moving to her electorate will receive, in many instances, relocation incentives for the first time. So I just note in passing that I am surprised that the question does not raise anything about those investments: hundreds of millions of dollars of extra money going into rural health.The question of cataracts is certainly something that we do not resile from at all. This is one of the many procedures on the Medicare benefits schedule that have been set at a rate for a very long period of time and that have not been adjusted with the advances of technology. This is surgery that can now be undertaken, in many instances, in a third, a quarter, a fifth or sometimes a tenth of the time it used to take. Instead of paying what is currently the fee for the most commonly performed services - about $830 - for something that takes 10 to 15 minutes in most instances, there will be a payment of $409 for the MBS fees. - I hear interjections from those who are ill-informed opposite, asking me about the cost of equipment. People would be aware that the Medicare benefits schedule pays for services provided. It is not intended to pay for the cost of equipment. It has never paid for the cost of equipment. When we are going to repeatedly run a health system where the costs and investments go up, when we have new technology that people want to access and when we have new drugs that people want to access then we have to be prepared to take some decisions to scale costs down where medical advances have provided a benefit to the community. This is one of those instances, and we do not resile from those changes in the budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. I also acknowledge the member for Lyons's strong engagement with the forestry sector in his electorate and the work that he has been doing there for some time, advocating that stored carbon in forest products forms part of Australia's negotiating strategy as we move towards Copenhagen. At Old Parliament House this morning we held the Agriculture Roundtable where I, and officials from my department and the Department of Climate Change, met with the leadership of the farmers organisations, state-by-state, nationally and commodity-by-commodity. We worked through issues relating to the work program for the decisions that need to be made in 2013 as to whether or not agriculture would be included in the scheme in 2015.We also had a briefing from ABARE. Members will remember that I referred to some figures in passing last Thursday as to the costs on farmers of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. That information has now been released and was provided to the people this morning. I am happy to provide the full information to the parliament by tabling that ABARE report now.The question also asks me about what different threats and opportunities there are for action through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, given that there are many people within this House and within the Senate who do not have the same constructive relationship that the farm organisations had this morning. I referred before to there being a claim of a constructive role from the Leader of the Nationals, where he had said, 'We have always said we are prepared to play a constructive role' - while the Leader of the Nationals in the other place paraphrases that by saying, 'No, no, no, no, no.' Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition made the comment that was referred to earlier by the Prime Minister:So yes, I've got no doubt we will have an emissions trading scheme in Australia. That's my view.A journalist then - I think this morning - put that quote back to the Leader of the Nationals. I think the journalist was pretty faithful to the quote from the Leader of the Opposition: 'On climate change, Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, says, 'There will be an ETS.' Will the Nats ever support that?' And the Leader of the Nationals said, 'Well, he didn't quite say that.'I am not sure how the claim from the Leader of the Opposition of, 'I've got no doubt that we will have an emissions trading scheme,' is not quite saying, 'There will be an ETS.' But apparently when the Nationals have a look at it, that is what that means. It is more confusion from the same group, as I have said before, that has provided a shadow minister who puts himself forward as a climate change sceptic. He then goes on to be the only climate change sceptic in a media release to claim that climate change is a massive threat. He is a climate change sceptic who describes climate change as a massive threat! They are special people in the National Party!We as the government have gone forward. As the Prime Minister mentioned earlier, the CPRS is not the only part of our response to climate change. There is significant research work going on both in the areas of adaptation announced recently and in the recent announcement with respect to biochar. On the adaptation work extreme temperatures have become an important part of dealing with climate change. That is why under the Climate Change Research Program we have extreme temperature research into livestock industries involving the CSIRO and the University of Melbourne. Changes in CO2 levels have an impact on cropping - possibly there will be some advantages to some cropping sectors with respect to CO2 concentration - and that work is being done under Australia's farming future with partnerships for the University of Melbourne, the Victorian Department of Primary Industries and the Grains Research and Development Corporation. There are industry opportunities as well in Northern Australia in being part of Australia's farming future. As well as that we have launched, at $1.4 million, the largest biochar research project in Australia's history. - We have from the Leader of the Opposition the claim that it took us a while. In 12 years in government with that man as the minister for environment it never occurred to them to do anything on biochar. Look at the chronology of when he made his speech because he made his speech calling for action on biochar in January this year. Yet on 12 July last year this government initiated two biochar research projects announced through Caring for our Country. Then in September last year we called for expressions of interest for a CSIRO project submitted under the first round of the Climate Change Research Program. The Climate Change Expert Panel in September last year recommended we wait until the CSIRO review was complete. Then in January the Leader of the Opposition called for the government to start to do what it is already doing. - Because it was a boringly bad speech. That was the reason. - At least when you were on Insiders I was in Braidwood on a farm and I did not have to watch it live. In February the CSIRO concluded its review of gaps in biochar research and then in May of this year, being able to assess the applications that had come in, we were able to then have $1.4 million through the CSIRO project announced. We were actually working through each stage and making sure of the government's interest in being part of the solution. At the same time on the other side we get three opposing views, two opposing parties, a confused person who composes himself and no policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, though I note again that every opportunity is used in question time to try and talk the Australian economy down when the government's strategy is to build the Australian economy up. That is the difference. We have a nation-building strategy for recovery; they have a negative strategy to talk the economy down because they have concluded that it is in their political interest to do so. As is standard practice, the budget does not attempt to forecast future movements in rates. Rates for current government bonds are, on average, around four per cent. This is a standard assumption that has been used for some time and it is the same methodology used under the previous government. Treasury has adopted the long-run average of the 10-year bond rate based on what has prevailed over the past decade, namely, six per cent. That is what we based our projections on in the budget. We stand by the budget papers.</DOC>

 - The word which does not pass the lips of those opposite is the challenge we face because of the global economic recession, one which affects all the economies around the world simultaneously. We had overnight data released from Canada for the March quarter. Canadian real GDP fell by 1.4 per cent in the March quarter. This is the worst quarterly outcome for Canada since 1991. This is also the second consecutive quarterly contraction, confirming that Canada is in a technical recession. That means - and members should focus on this point - that every one of the major advanced economies around the world is now in recession. Secondly, 24 out of the 30 OECD economies are in recession, and 29 out of the 30 OECD economies have experienced at least one-quarter of negative economic growth.Our strategy, as the Australian government, is not to stand idly by but to act, to intervene, to step up to the plate while the private sector is in retreat - for the government to make a difference. That is the responsible course of action being pursued by governments around the world. That is why we have invested some $77 billion in stimulus to support the Australian economy now when it needs it. Some $49 billion or about 70 per cent of our nation-building stimulus goes into nation-building infrastructure - rail, road, ports, high-speed broadband, other forms of physical infrastructure; $3.9 billion goes to support business, especially small business through the investment allowance and small business, as the minister advised me earlier today, are responding to this big time; $23 billion goes to providing immediate support to the economy during the darkest period of contraction through direct payments to families, pensioners, veterans, carers and others; and $1.6 billion goes to supporting training apprenticeships and employment. This represents an unprecedented response by the government to an unprecedented global economic challenge - the worst economic crisis in 75 years.Can I say to those opposite that Australia is doing better than most other economies despite the challenge of the global recession, and those opposite constantly have something negative to say about this. We believe it is important to be positive about the Australian economy, positive about our performance relative to the rest of the world, rather than simply advance a negative political critique all the time. Average growth in the OECD -  - The great thing about Joe Hockey is that, when he bellows, you know that he is on thin ground. The louder Joe bellows, the thinner the argument is. - I thank the member for Curtin for yet another original intervention in the place, given that originality is her first and strongest suit! - I love to see the member for Canning up. Our good friend the member for Canning says here in parliament, 'Borrow what you need to invest in my electorate,' but what happens when the actual vote is taken? He votes with the other side. The member for Canning should hang his head in shame. - I thank the member for Sturt again for his intervention! Average growth in the OECD in the December quarter was minus two per cent. In Australia it was negative 0.5 per cent. As we saw yesterday, Australian retail trade has also performed better than most other economies. Australian retail trade figures are now running at 4.8 per cent above those levels from November last year. This contrasts with a 1.1 per cent fall in retail sales across the other major advanced economies. Again, that is a 4.8 per cent increase by us, a 1.1 per cent fall by other economies. That represents the difference in government policy.Secondly, ABS building approvals data: in April, total building approvals rose by - wait for it, those opposite - 5.1 per cent. Now, you would think those opposite would say, 'That's good news for the economy; that's positive out there in terms of pumping the economy up,' but no. Because it is good news, because it is positive news, they choose to remain silent. Again I would contrast what has happened in Australia relative to other economies. Building approvals are only -  - 16.1 per cent lower through the year to April in Australia, compared to the latest through-the-year falls of 38.3 per cent in Canada, 50.2 per cent in the United States and 56.6 per cent in New Zealand. What government policy has been initiated by this side of the House to provide support for the building industry? It is called the first home owners boost. And what I can announce today is new data from the Australian Treasury whereby in April we saw the highest take-up so far of the first home owners boost - the highest take-up so far: 18,736 Australians taking up the first home owners boost in April. I assume that gets a 'hear, hear' from those opposite? - Well, it seems -  - The first home owners boost, I thought, was one they voted for. - Joe is so sloppy. In these measures which were adopted last year -  - Mr Speaker, the member for North Sydney has become notoriously sloppy about these matters. Do you know why? Because he has just interjected that they have problems with the first home owners boost, but I seem to remember them saying in this parliament, when it was announced last October, that this was the best thing since sliced bread. So, in other words, you say yes at the time and then no later on. This actually points to the absolute opportunism of most things which those opposite are engaged in in this debate about how we restore the Australian economy to growth, given the challenges of the global economic recession.On the first home owners boost, which is attracting such enthusiasm on the part of those opposite, 78,000 Australians have taken up the boost through to April - 78,000 Australians. From each electorate represented in this parliament, 78,000 Australians, mainly young people, are taking it up for the first time. In fact, we got a letter from a man named Jim, from a place called Joslin in South Australia -  -  - No, I am just about to quote what Jim from Joslin in South Australia says. It is from your state, Member for Sturt. He says: 'I am nearly 49 years old and, while I earn a reasonable salary, homeownership was out of the question for many years. Thanks to the government and the doubling of the government's grant for first home buyers, I am happy to say that I was able to buy the property that I rented for the last nine years.' There you go. So, as far as this Australian citizen is concerned, he has benefited from an official cut in interest rates of 4¼ per cent. Remember, those opposite had 10 interest rate rises in a row. We have had a 4¼ per cent interest rate cut. The impact on average mortgages has been significant. Therefore, if you add to that the impact of the first home owners boost, you can see the overall benefit which has been delivered.To add to the positive joy on the part of those opposite, I would also ask the member for North Sydney to give us his views on the balance of payments data today, because today we welcome positive data on the Australian balance of payments. Today we register a $5.1 billion trade surplus in the March quarter. It is Australia's largest trade surplus on record. The current account deficit was $4.6 billion, or 1.5 per cent of GDP. We therefore have data today on what is happening in the building sector and we have data which has also been released recently in relation to other sectors of the economy, and what they point to is that this government is seeking to make a difference through its interventions on economic policy. The alternative government can sit back, do nothing, carp from the side, talk the economy down and be negative, or they can be positive and be out there building up the Australian economy. We will have, of course, the national accounts data. The markets are already predicting a negative quarter for Australia when the data is released here tomorrow.This government is out there doing what it can to make a difference, to try and cushion Australia from the full impact of the global recession, to cushion jobs and small business from its impact, because our nation-building strategy for recovery is this: to support jobs, small business and apprenticeships today by building and investing in the nation-building infrastructure for tomorrow. That is our strategy. It is a positive strategy. I would suggest that those opposite stop their negative talking down of the economy and instead join with a positive program for Australia's future.</DOC>

 - Were that the case I daresay I would not come into this place each day because the debates we have here are along the following lines: a tide of negativity versus positive proposals for the future. That is the debate we are having here. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: why is it on this question of response to the global economic recession those opposite have such a thin veneer of credibility? It is this: those opposite, led by the member for Higgins, who will soon be down the front here leading the opposition -  - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his intervention. I gather, though, that it is less colourful than some of the interventions which occurred in the joint party room earlier today. I understand we had the member for Hume sizing up as the heavyweight champion of New South Wales and the lightweight of the House, the member for Aston -  - I stand corrected: it was the member for Hume, the heavyweight champion of New South Wales, sizing up against the lightweight, the member for Aston -  - The question went to the whole point about conflict in debate and contrasting ideas. I understand there was some of that in the joint party room today as two members physically sized up against each other.Government members - Oh! - I thank the member for O'Connor for his intervention. The Leader of the Opposition asked before about conflict and different views and how we handle the economy. It is quite plain that there is a division between us. We actually stand for a positive program of nation building for recovery. That is what we are doing. Those opposite are pretending that they do not engage in debt and deficit. That is the actual nature of the dynamic here. We are upfront with the Australian people about what we are doing, how we are doing it and what impact it is having, recognising the degree of challenge represented by the contraction in the global economy, the worst we have seen in three-quarters of a century. Those opposite are trying to walk both sides of the street. On the one hand they are in here supporting these measures; on the other hand they are out there saying that they do not support the debt and deficit necessary to support these measures - except when you actually pin them down.When the member for North Sydney famously went out the day after the budget and was asked by Koshy on Channel 7's Sunrise, 'Okay, member for North Sydney, what is your deficit target, what is your debt target?' and the member for North Sydney said in response, '$25 billion less.' Then, the other day, just to make sure there was consistency on the part of those opposite our good friend the member for Warringah in Sydney - I cannot mention members by their first name anymore - said that their deficit target was $21 billion less than the government's. It was $25 billion less according to the member for North Sydney; according to another member of the front bench, on his online discussion website, by the way, it was $21 billion less. Then the Leader of the Opposition was confronted about this in the debate about debt and deficit recently. When he was asked to name the number, because he had been prosecuting a debate about numbers each day of the week, he said, 'It's not a question of the number.'So those opposite are simply exposed for what they are - absolutely fraudulent on this position. The government's position on gross debt is around $300 billion. By the admission of the member for North Sydney it is therefore $275 billion of Liberal debt; by the admission of the -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, because I repeat the proposition that the Liberal Party's and the National Party's position on debt and deficit rests entirely on an exercise in fraudulence. It is policy fraudulence. The fraudulence is this: those opposite are saying that they would not engage in deficit and deficit financing. Those opposite, however, have said, when pressed: firstly, that theirs would be $25 billion less than the government's, which means that you have a Liberal Party policy of a $275 billion gross debt; secondly, if you take the member for Warringah's proposition, it is $21 billion less, which means that you have a $281 billion debt position on the part of the Liberal Party; and, thirdly, you have the Leader of the Opposition's position. He says that it is not a question of the number. - Can I say, in response to the bellowing interjections of those opposite, that ultimately the truth outs, in this business, and what you are engaged in is a piece of fraudulence. First of all, what you are saying is that if there were a $210 billion collapse in revenues you would not borrow for that - or would you? In your more honest moments you have said that you would. - Therefore, Mr Speaker, the second question is this: what element of discretionary stimulus would the opposition support? The Liberal Party have said that they would support investment and infrastructure, therefore you are left with a difference of between the total amount which is the subject of deficit and debt, $300 billion, and discretionary payments to individuals - that is, to pensioners, carers and others - which comes to a total figure of around $20 billion, half of which they indicated they supported when the first round of measures was announced at the end of last year: those for pensioners, carers and veterans. If you look at the logic of that it comes down to about $10 billion difference.Then you look on top of that again. Those opposite constantly say that when it comes to the ultimate difference between us and them it is as if there is an ocean of difference between us, but the reality is that their position, underneath it all, is virtually the same. That is why I go back to the proposition I put before: the opposition's argument on debt and deficit rests on an exercise in policy and political fraudulence, and they know it.Furthermore, I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: Australia has the lowest net debt of all the major economies. I say this also to those opposite: subsequent to the budget Standard and Poor's reaffirmed the government's AAA rating. Subsequent to the budget, commentators out there in the mainstream community were virtually uniform in their support for the sorts of fiscal and stimulatory measures engaged in by the government, and by the sustainability strategy announced by the Treasurer in the budget papers. This is a government strategy. It is upfront and positive and it says what we are about to do, why we are doing it and the effect it will have, as canvassed in my earlier answer to a question today.Those opposite, at the end of the day, are seeking to walk two sides of the street. They know what they are doing. They actually, however, have this about them by way of delusion: that the Australian people do not see through it. My advice to the Leader of the Opposition is that they see right through it and spot fraudulence at a thousand paces.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. On 8 April I was with the member for Page turning the first sod on the Alstonville bypass. This is a $90 million investment supporting up to 140 jobs. It followed what happened last year, when work began on the Ballina bypass - a $446 million project, where 361 Australians are working right now, today. Jobs are being created today in building the infrastructure that will benefit the New South Wales North Coast in the future.But it is not just in the electorate of Page. This is a government that supports investment in regional Australia regardless of the electorate. In Cowper, just south of Page, the Rudd government is investing a record $1.15 billion on the Pacific Highway - in that electorate alone. This includes the Kempsey bypass, which was announced in the budget - 450 direct jobs in Cowper for this $618 million project. It includes $54 million on the Glenugie upgrade. It includes the duplication of the Pacific Highway between Sapphire and Woolgoolga - $460 million.Now, that is $1.15 billion in one electorate held by the National Party. What did the former government spend on the Pacific Highway in 12 years in office? They spent $1.3 billion on the whole thing in 12 years. We are spending almost that in one electorate held by the National Party as part of our Nation Building Program - as part of our $3.1 billion investment in the Pacific Highway.I have been asked about how this has been received by the community. It has been received very well. The Macleay Argus said:$618 mil for our bypass.It is great news for Kempsey in the federal budget. If you go inside the paper, the headlines included, '500 jobs in highway project,' and outlined the details of what this project of nation building will be on the New South Wales North Coast. -  - I am just outlining the reception that our record nation-building investment is getting on the New South Wales North Coast. The local mayor is quoted as saying 'Let's work to have town ready'. Another headline: 'A pleasant surprise for the NRMA'. Another headline: 'Truckies welcome plan for faster, safer road'. There were four pages on this issue. Another one: 'State minister delighted by terrific budget result'. And 'The cracker start and finish date is great news'. Here is what Andrew Stoner, the Leader of the New South Wales National Party said: 'It's great that Kempsey is finally getting some attention from government.' After 12 years of representation from those opposite, the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales says, 'It's great that Kempsey is finally getting some attention from government.' But the member for Cowper, of course, had some things to say as well. The member for Cowper said this: 'The Kempsey bypass is long overdue.' During 12 years in government, nothing happens. We come to office, it happens and he says that the Kempsey bypass is long overdue, once again exposing the opportunism of those opposite. They simply do not know what day it is in the coalition party room. They do not know what day it is. The member for Hume thought it was 1 June and he gave the member for Aston a pinch and a punch for the first of the month. They have no idea what day it is.</DOC>

As the honourable member would know, neither this government nor any of its predecessors predicts future movements in interest rates. That lies within the preserve of the Reserve Bank. Secondly, on the question of bond rates for public debt, I would refer the honourable member to the answer I delivered to his first question in question time today, which went to the basis upon which we projected bond rates in the budget papers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I know that he would be supporting the 74 projects in his electorate at a cost of $19.9 million that are a part of the government's economic stimulus to support jobs today whilst building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. I am sure the member is very keenly supporting the 54 projects in his electorate under the Building the Education Revolution program, the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. The member, of course, would be aware that the 54 projects in his electorate are part of 15,000 projects that have already been approved across the nation to support our schools. Whilst they are supporting our schools and building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow, they are also supporting apprentices and trainees around the country. The Building the Education Revolution program is designed to support jobs in local communities, including the jobs of apprentices. We know that apprentices can be at risk of unemployment and being left out of trade during an economic downturn. Of course, the global economic recession could have that impact on their employment. That is why, as part of the guidelines for the Building the Education Revolution, the government required that project managers give priority in contracting and tendering arrangements to businesses that have demonstrated a commitment to adding or retaining trainees and apprentices.We have also worked to create incentives for employers to take on those apprentices who may find that they are out of trade - that is, they have commenced their apprenticeship and are partway through and for whatever reason their employer cannot keep them on to complete their training. Obviously, unless they get another opportunity, their training can go to waste. So Building the Education Revolution has this priority for apprentices and trainees, and then there are incentives available to support employers who take on an out-of-trade apprentice. Most particularly, there is a $145.6 million investment in direct incentives for employers to take on out-of-trade apprentices and a $9.7 million investment to help out-of-trade apprentices and trainees to complete their training through registered training organisations.Generally, all of this relates to our $3.8 billion investment in the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program. So there is support for apprentices through Building the Education Revolution, special incentives for out-of-trade apprentices and our $3.8 billion plan to support apprenticeships through the Australian Apprenticeships Incentives Program.While the government supports economic stimulus and consequently supports the employment of apprentices, what we have from those opposite is negativity and opposition to the economic stimulus and to Building the Education Revolution. Some days they are opposed entirely, some days they are opposed to it in part and some days they are trying to muscle their way into shots in their electorates so that they can get a run in their local newspapers. The Leader of the Opposition has had many positions on this - almost beyond count. But one of the things the Leader of the Opposition said in March on the Insiders program is -  - I was asked about supporting Australian apprentices and I am indicating a risk to that support, and a risk to that support is the stated position of the Leader of the Opposition when he said:We put up an alternative _ Which would have involved spending money on schools but not so much; spending $3 billion instead of $14 billion _Then in May he said:Well when we are returned to Government after the next election, we've said that we will establish a commission to look at the financial sustainability of the Budget and of all the spending measures. - On the question of supporting Australian apprentices, the question arises whether the Building the Education Revolution program can continue to support Australian apprentices when the stated position of the Leader of the Opposition is that he does not support it - either totally some days or, other days, part of it. He needs to come clean, project by project, on what he does support and what he opposes. Does he back the $125,000 for Paddington Public School -  - or the $750,000 for the St Charles School? This is all about supporting apprentices. - Australian apprentices are entitled to know.</DOC>

 - It is yet another question from those opposite about the forecasts in the budget, particularly the forecasts relating to debt. We are absolutely unapologetic about the need to borrow to support our economy - to support jobs in our economy, to support businesses in our economy and to support the rural sector as well. Everyone in our economy benefits from the economic stimulus that we have put into the system, and the economic stimulus that shows through, particularly in retail sales, goes right through to the farm gate.But, of course, those opposite are so desperate to see the economy fail they want to talk it down all of the time. I would have thought that the retail sales figures that came out yesterday would have been welcomed by those opposite. They are very, very good news for the rural sector, because demand has gone up in those areas where people are buying the basics. You only have to look at what was said yesterday by Mr Luscombe from Woolies. He talked about the impact not just in the retail sector but right down the supply chain and the fact that for every worker employed in retail there are many more workers employed down the supply chain, including in the rural sector. - Indeed this is what Mr Luscombe had to say yesterday:For every million dollar's worth of sales, retail sales in Australia support eight full-time jobs in the retail sector alone and another 13 in supplying the retail sector. So clearly you have to give the government a very big tick.The fiscal stimulus that we are borrowing responsibly for is supporting employment, incomes and businesses, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for her question. It is very important that fiscal and monetary policies do work together to stimulate our economy, to support vital employment in the economy, to support the business community and to support the rural community. Indeed it is doing that. We had the statement today from the Reserve Bank that they have decided to keep official interest rates unchanged at three per cent - the lowest in almost 50 years. This follows rate cuts totalling 4.25 per cent since September last year. That has seen the standard variable home mortgage interest rate fall to 5¾ per cent, which is delivering savings of $750 per month to a family with a $300,000 mortgage. Lower interest rates, combined with the government's stimulus, are helping to cushion Australians from the very worst of the global recession. I will quote from the statement from the Reserve Bank today. The statement said:Monetary policy has been eased significantly _ Fiscal measures are also providing considerable support for demand.So monetary policy is working with fiscal policy. Fiscal policy has been put in place in three waves: firstly, to support households; secondly, through shovel-ready investments in infrastructure projects right across the country; and, of course, the third phase was delivered in the budget, which is investing in the longer term nation-building infrastructure that those opposite oppose. As the Reserve Bank statement points out, this is very necessary because of the evidence from the international economy, which is contracting, and has contracted sharply, particularly in the March quarter.Last night we received further evidence of the impact of this global recession, with Canada reporting that its economy had contracted by a further 1.4 per cent in the March quarter - a very dramatic contraction for that country. This means that something like 19 of the 21 advanced economies have recorded growth outcomes which went backwards in the March quarter. That means that the March quarter was a particularly bad quarter internationally. It demonstrates the very strong case for the economic stimulus put in place by this government: responsible borrowing to support employment, to support Australian businesses and to support Australian families. That is the support that is required now, given the circumstances that have been imposed on this country by the rest of the world. It is absolutely incomprehensible that those opposite could sit in this House and oppose vital measures that support employment right across the community, that support demand and that support Australian businesses.</DOC>

 - It is the case that the government is borrowing responsibly to support employment in the Australian economy. It is now absolutely the case, and it has been demonstrated time and time again, that every one of those Australians who has been supported in employment are opposed by those opposite. This has been made very clear. Unemployment would have been much higher if it had not been for the responsible course of action this government embarked upon to support employment in the Australian community.There is some discussion from those opposite about paying off debt. I can tell you one thing: all of those people out there with families are very appreciative of the fact that their families are in employment because we had the common sense to borrow and support employment and business in the Australian community. We have had the capacity to do so more than just about every other advanced economy in the world, and we have taken the responsible course of doing that to protect our communities. We understand the human cost of unemployment. We understand the economic cost of unemployment. We understand the social cost of unemployment. - I was just explaining the case for responsible borrowing. Of course, those opposite want to pretend that if they were in government now they would not be borrowing for the $210 billion revenue collapse. They would not be borrowing for stimulus. The Leader of the Opposition was asked about this on the Insiders program on the weekend. - Yes, Mr Speaker, it was a question about borrowing. It was a question about debt, and on the weekend the Leader of the Opposition was asked by Barrie Cassidy to give a precise idea about how much he would borrow. He said, 'It isn't possible.' So the truth is, and we know it now, their debt would not be a cent less than ours and they would not pay it off a day earlier - or perhaps maybe by just a little, because Joe would just go for $25 billion less. This is a farce. - The truth is that those opposite are shameless opportunists who would happily watch Australians lose their jobs if it helped them politically.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question but also note the support of the member for Franklin for the government's $4 million investment in the Kingborough Sports Centre, a project which is supporting local sports, is supporting the local community and, importantly, is supporting local jobs. This is just one example, but in response to the question of the member for Franklin I am happy to share with the House some other examples, some good news stories about the benefits of this government's decisive action - the benefits for sport, the benefits for community and the benefits for jobs. -  - The over $300 million which this government committed to sports infrastructure in the Nation Building and Jobs Plan has been the largest one-off federal injection into sporting facilities in our history. We know those opposite do not want to hear about it - because they did not want to vote for it - but we on this side of the House are proud that this is the largest single investment in sporting facilities in this nation's history. It is providing tangible benefits for sports, benefits for communities and benefits for jobs right around the nation.As examples to back this up, I can point to the $3.6 million for the Tambourine Mountain Sport and Recreation Complex that will be built in the hinterlands of the Gold Coast. I went and visited this site along with the member for Forde. The site is currently a cow paddock. It does not take too much imagination to realise that a huge number of jobs are created in the process of turning a current cow field into a state-of-the-art, multisport facility for the local community. These projects are providing real support for jobs right now, when it is needed for the community - but they are doing something else too. They are providing infrastructure that will deliver for our community into the long term. This is true of the $2 million which has been provided for upgraded lighting at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart and which will help to ensure that the oval remains a venue for One Day International and Twenty20 cricket matches - an outcome that is really very important for cricket and really very important for Tasmania. I know that my Tasmanian colleagues are looking forward to Australia taking on the West Indies under lights in their Twenty20 game in February. - But it is also true of the $36 million that this government is investing in the Gold Coast Stadium. This will ensure this significant project goes ahead and will support local jobs right across the Gold Coast. And I am not at all shocked to realise the member for Moncrieff is not listening, because the member for Moncrieff did not vote for this project. When you have a look at the data provided by the AFL you will be surprised to know that the member for Moncrieff did not vote for this project, because the data indicates that over a four-year period this project is expected to deliver over 2,200 full-time equivalent jobs each year and generate $415 million of economic activity.But of course this is also very important for the long term for the Gold Coast, because we know that it will provide a home and a presence for the AFL on the Gold Coast on an ongoing basis and will also mean that the Gold Coast will be able to host significant sporting events in their upgraded stadium. So on this side of the House we are very proud to support this infrastructure, and we support it here in the parliament as well as out there in the communities. This investment in infrastructure is very good news for Australian sport, but it is also very good news for Australian communities and, importantly, for Australian jobs.</DOC>

 - Yet another question from the shadow Treasurer, who simply does not understand what is happening in the economy. The problem we have in the economy is an absence of demand, and the federal government is moving in to actually stimulate demand. So the problems in credit flow do not have anything to do at all with the government's current borrowing program. - It is a bit rich for this to come from those opposite, who opposed the bank guarantee, particularly the wholesale funding guarantee, which has probably done more than any other measure to put confidence into our system and which has stabilised the Australian economy. We have been very active to ensure that credit flows as freely as it possibly can, given what is going on internationally. The Australian government has been very active. For the shadow Treasurer to get up and somehow argue that borrowing is being crowded out by the federal government's actions in borrowing to support demand is a nonsense.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Again I would commend to those opposite some good news for the Australian economy in the midst of a global economic recession, and it goes to statements today by the CEO of Holden Australia concerning the future of the company in this country. This is important for Australia. It is important for manufacturing in Australia. Today I met with the Holden CEO, Mark Reuss, and he had already had earlier discussions with the industry minister, Senator Carr. The CEO of Holden has advised that Holden's operations will be unchanged by announcements in the United States by General Motors. Specifically, he has advised that Holden will be part of the new GM. He has advised that Holden will not be included in the US filing under chapter 11. He advised that there will be no direct impact on local design, engineering and manufacturing operations. He advised that technology improvements to the Commodore and the introduction of the second car line remain on track. He advised there will be no changes to Holden employees and supplier payment arrangements and he advised there will be no changes to Holden dealer and warranty arrangements. I would say this is good news for the Australian economy - good news at a time when we have seen such an assault on the automobile industry worldwide as a direct product of the global economic recession.We cannot underestimate the significance of developments in the United States in the auto industry. General Motors' decision to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy is a powerful symbol of the challenges now facing the global economy. This is the single largest industrial bankruptcy in US history. The actions of the Obama administration to support the industry are unprecedented. But Holden here in Australia has not been caught up in these US developments. Holden is considered an A-list asset in the General Motors group. It is in contrast to speculation in Australia that this would directly wipe away Australian motor vehicle manufacturing, particularly through General Motors Holden. Holden has forged its path through difficult circumstances, and the company's leadership and its employees have worked together to achieve this. They have also done so in direct partnership with the Australian government.The Australian government last year, in the midst of great criticism on the part of those opposite, launched a $6.2 billion new Green Car Plan providing certainty for the sector right out for 2020. This was government acting ahead of the curve. This was government acting at a time -  -  - I take it those opposite are still opposed to this plan. South Australian members? Member for Sturt? Is he opposed to this plan? He remains silent. Can I say to all South Australia members that I would suggest they consider long and hard whether they support this vital piece of industry policy and industry plan because it goes directly to jobs in South Australia and jobs for the auto sector more broadly across the country.As well, in December last year, I was pleased to visit Holden's Elizabeth plant in Adelaide to announce a $149 million investment from the Commonwealth government's innovation fund for the green car. This will be used for the production of a new four-cylinder small car here in Australia. Holden produces 100,000 cars a year, exports cars to all continents and employs over 6,000 Australians. Those 6,000 jobs are important jobs. They are like the jobs in the retail sector that the government is supporting by other policy means. They are like the jobs in the housing and construction sector that the government is supporting by other policy means. It is something of which this government is proud. We have been out there in partnership with industry. Australia is one of only 15 countries in the world that can produce a car from scratch. That is why we have been in there, with our sleeves rolled up, working with industry when it counted to provide confidence for the industry at a time of unprecedented downturn. All those opposite can do is scoff, be negative, talk the economy down, talk the industry down, talk manufacturing down. I would suggest those opposite should change their tone.In conclusion, let me quote Mark Reuss, the CEO and Chairman of GM Holden, who said today, in an extract from his press conference with the Senator Carr:As an American and in Australia and watching this from afar I have worked in quite a few different places around the world and I, speaking on behalf of GM, have to say that we are absolutely fortunate to have a government that actually cares about manufacturing.He went on to say:Manufacturing things in an economy that is very, very robust compared with the rest of the world right now.Good news again. Those opposite bury themselves in their papers. He goes on to say the following:If you look at the other countries where auto makers are having problems, there are cash bailouts, there's transfers of ownership, there's all sorts of things happening at the very last minute. I feel like our partnership with the government here in Australia as an industry and as Holden -  -  - Those opposite are still objecting to this positive news for the Australian economy, always talking the economy down. He says about General Motors Holden:I feel like our partnership with the Australian government here in Australia as an industry and as Holden has been like studying for an exam and we have now passed the exam to be part of the new GM for the future.Had the government not taken the decision last year to put forward a $6.2 billion new car plan for Australia, where GM was an active partner with the government in that plan, it is quite plain that the industry's future would be considerably uncertain. We have this great statement from the CEO of Holden Australia today. It is something of which the government is proud and I would ask all members of the House to express their support for the future of this auto industry in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Australia takes very seriously its reputation as a safe destination for international students and yesterday in the House the Prime Minister spoke on behalf of, I think, all members and all Australians in deploring and condemning the recent outrageous attacks on young Indians studying or working in Australia. The government again condemns all attacks of this sort, whoever is the target. More than 90,000 Indian students in Australia are welcome guests to our country as are the more than 200,000 Australians of Indian descent, who are welcome members of the Australian community, making a substantial contribution to it. On Friday last week I spoke to my counterpart, External Affairs Minister Krishna, both to congratulate him on his appointment but also to assure him of the seriousness with which the Australian government is addressing these issues. Australia's High Commissioner in New Delhi, John McCarthy, has also made the Australian government's resolve to tackle this issue well known to the Indian authorities.The government is working closely with state governments to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice and that relevant government agencies are responding to these crimes to protect all students and others in the Australian community. The National Security Adviser, Mr Duncan Lewis, is today chairing the first meeting of a new task force to coordinate the Australian government's response. The task force will include senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Attorney-General's Department. Through this task force the Australian government is showing its resolve to play its part in collaboration with the states to respond to this very serious issue. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education announced on 28 May that international student representatives would be invited to a roundtable to discuss issues affecting their study experience including accommodation, safety and welfare. The Deputy Prime Minister will convene this roundtable in the near future.Can I also inform the House of the response to this matter by our state colleagues in Victoria. Earlier today I spoke to Premier John Brumby, who shares these concerns, has been strong in his condemnation of these terrible attacks and quick with practical action to meet them. Premier Brumby announced on 28 May that he would look to implement the remaining recommendations of the Victorian government task force on international students commissioned last year. The Victorian government has today committed to amending sentencing guidelines in Victoria to make violence specifically targeted against individuals on the basis of their race, religion, sexuality, age or disability an aggravating factor in recognition of the wider adverse social impact that so-called hate crimes can cause. Victoria Police has established a community reference group to facilitate communication on safety issues with the Indian community in Victoria. The community reference group has established a 1800 number to provide support, information and advice to Indian students who are victims of crime. The hotline is staffed by volunteers who are fluent in English and Hindi and the volunteers have received training from Victoria Police. The Victoria Police multicultural liaison officer will travel to India later this month to discuss student safety issues.This issue requires a response across the range of governments, state and Commonwealth, and across the range of government agencies. Australia again sends the message to the Indian people that Australia is serious about ensuring the safety of Indian students as we are serious about ensuring the safety of all visitors to our country. Our resolve is reflected not just by our condemnation of recent attacks against Indian students but by our practical action in conjunction with the states and the Indian community in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. To answer this question very clearly, I think he would understand that, with 15,000 projects already agreed to, I do not know off the top of my head the details of every individual project out of 15,000 projects. But I take it that he has asked the question seriously and on that basis I am very happy to work with him directly as to the circumstances of this school. On the question of the guidelines and on-costs - for the member's information and for members in the House who are concerned about this matter - the Building the Education Revolution guidelines are crystal clear. The administrative costs of states and territories in delivering the program are confined to 1.5 per cent and the project costs of those who are actually out delivering the building projects are confined to four per cent, so 1.5 per cent and then four per cent. Those are the guidelines available on the website for any member to check. If the member is concerned that something is happening in his local community that does not acquit those guidelines, then we would certainly work with him, because the point of view of the federal government is that this program will be delivered within the guidelines. We are working around the country with states and territories and with block grant authorities to ensure that is delivered. Can I say more generally, on the question of Building the Education Revolution, we are always happy to work with local members of parliament who become apprised of problems. But the essential issue here remains that this side of the House voted for $14.7 billion to be invested in schools and in supporting local jobs and the member who asked the question did not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I know full well the great interest he takes in the export industries. In fact, we were meeting on Friday in Adelaide with successful recipients of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme - a scheme which those on that side of the House promised to make easier and then failed to fund and which we, in the last budget, ensured would enable the full payment under the EMDG from the sclerotic mess that those opposite left this scheme in.I can, and am very pleased to, talk about the success of Australia's recent trade performance because it has been one of the very effective cushions enabling Australia to weather the global financial crisis far better than others. World trade has not been a cause of the global financial crisis but it certainly has been impacted by it. There have been all sorts of projections - most recently, that this year will see a drop in trade of 11 per cent.Australia, on the other hand, has continued to put in an important and strong trade performance. We have posted eight consecutive monthly trade surpluses. The balance of payments figures that were published today for the March quarter show that the current account deficit fell by $1.7 billion to $4.6 billion in the March quarter - the lowest quarterly current account deficit since December of 2001. This represents the equivalent of 1½ per cent of the December quarter GDP compared to 2.1 per cent previously. Goods and services export volumes increased by 2.7 per cent and net exports are expected to have contributed 2.2 percentage points to GDP growth in the March quarter of 2009.Net foreign debt - something we never heard the other side talk about - fell by three per cent to $674 billion. We hear the other side of the House talk about debt. They were the ones that had the debt truck before the change of government in 1996. Do you remember the debt truck that was parked outside the front of Parliament House? And this was a government that promised to reduce the foreign debt. The point is: they doubled it. They turned that debt truck into a B-double and parked it in the driveway of every Australian household in this country. It took a Labor government, on coming to office, to understand the importance of net exports to our GDP and to make constructive efforts to advance it.These are significant figures. Another important thing to understand in these balance of payments figures is that the balance on trade in services turned around from a deficit of $191 million to a surplus of $448 million. Goods and services export volumes rose by 2.7 per cent - a very strong performance given the global environment.It was not until we came to office that we really highlighted the importance of focusing on services exports. The problem in this parliament is that, while ever trade defaults to the National Party under a coalition government, the focus of trade will only be on agriculture - and essentially broadacre agriculture at that.The fact is: we need a diversified approach to trade. Of course we have to improve market access for our agriculture but we have to concentrate as well on elaborately transformed manufactures, on services and on investment. It was not until this government came to power that we have built that comprehensiveness into the approach to trade policy and it is beginning to show important dividends. It is important that we keep the task up.</DOC>

 - I will answer the member's question fairly simply. The Building the Education Revolution guidelines are there for all to see. The administrative costs and the project costs are as I have described. Block grant authorities and schools are taking different approaches to tendering arrangements, which is what you would expect -  - I was asked about the potential for 'rip-offs', as the member styled it, and I am answering that question. The guidelines are clear. The distribution to schools is clear. Under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program and the National School Pride Program, that is correlated to school size. The science and language laboratory program is a competitive bid program. Different schools are under different systems, obviously - block grant authorities, states and territories taking a different approach to tendering arrangements -  - Some schools are tendering locally. Some block grant authorities and states are tendering through more centralised arrangements. We will obviously be working with them -  - Obviously, in making tendering arrangements, we will be working with states and territories to help them get value for money.Can I say that we need to remember that the context in which this is occurring is a global financial crisis. We know that the construction industry is being severely impacted by that global financial crisis. Consequently, because of that economic impact, in communities right around the country there is spare construction capacity, and without this economic stimulus the people working in those construction companies would become unemployed. I know that the member who asked the question and the member who is vying for him to be shadow minister for education might be unconcerned about that, because they voted against this program, but this government is concerned with delivering economic stimulus around the country, value-for-money projects that will make a difference to education infrastructure in this country through the biggest school modernisation program the country has ever seen, and support for jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question, because I know that she has been following closely the action the government has been taking to tackle binge drinking. Of course, the government has taken a number of decisive and concrete steps in tackling binge drinking, including encouraging Australians to lead a healthier lifestyle, and an important part of that strategy is closing the alcopops tax loophole.After 12 months of irresponsible and opportunistic obstruction, I did hold out just a glimmer of hope that maybe today the Liberal Party would finally come to a decision on whether it was going to support this alcopops measure or not. I thought that the party room might have been dealing with this issue. Obviously there has been a lot of speculation from the frontbench and from the leader, and I thought that there might have even been a gradual awakening from the Leader of the Opposition that, if 80 per cent of Australians think that binge drinking is a problem, maybe he should not be the last man standing opposing the measures that we are taking to tackle alcohol abuse. But, unfortunately, today the Liberal Party failed again to finally take a position. - I am responding to the question, because in particular I was asked the question of whether there were any recent developments in supporting or opposing the action that the government is taking. The problem is, of course, the Liberal Party now are doing both of those things - supporting and opposing this measure. You have the shadow minister for health, who has always been implacably opposed to this measure, who has been in the pockets of the distillers. He has happily outsourced his policy making to the distilling industry. - I withdraw. The shadow minister has, every time that we have debated this measure in the House, walked straight out the door and straight to talk to Mr Broderick to find out if he has followed his instructions properly or not.What we have seen after the budget is a number of people in the Liberal Party understanding that not only is this an effective health measure, and perhaps it is silly to be standing in the way of it, but also in these global financial circumstances it might not be so bright to be standing in the way of a sensible health measure that has a budgetary impact. So there were some indications from the Leader of the Opposition and from a number of others that maybe there was an opportunity to change this. But we have seen Mr Dutton, the shadow minister, out there, still arguing to the death that this should not be supported.Then we saw a slight change; they were buying a little bit of time. We heard some speculation in the media that the opposition wanted to see the details of what we were doing. They were pretending, it seems, that they needed more information before they could try and sort out what they were going to do. What I want to know is what it actually is that the Liberal Party is waiting for. This legislation was introduced five months ago, in February this year. Prior to that it was the subject of a Senate inquiry. Then there was a second Senate inquiry. It was debated and voted upon in the Senate on 18 March. We announced on 15 April that the government would reintroduce that same legislation. And then what happened? We still had the member for Dickson saying he wants a little bit more information - he just wants to see the legislation. I do not know why he needs to look at it yet again, but he needs to have a look at it again. In May, we offered the member for Dickson another briefing on the same legislation. It is entertaining but embarrassingly wrong, because it is the same legislation that has been introduced. - We have been showing it to them for five months but still the member for Dickson cannot make up his mind what he wants to do, because he is getting instructions from outside the parliament. He does not want to change his mind, along with the Leader of the Opposition. They do not want to do something sensible so they are still pretending that they need more information. But I am not sure what more we can possibly give them.Ultimately, we cannot solve their internal problems. If they go to their party room meeting and come out again with no decision, all we gather from that is that they are impossibly divided on this and every other issue. But now is the time to stop ignoring the 80 per cent of the public who want action taken and to stop ignoring that this measure is working: a 35 per cent drop in alcopops, an eight per cent drop in overall spirits and a half a per cent drop in all consumption of alcohol. It is time to clarify where you stand and it is time for the backbench to decide whether they are going to support the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Dickson.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question because it goes to what we have seen in the international economic data overnight. In particular, we have released data from the Eurozone. European GDP figures released overnight show that the 16 countries that make up the euro area contracted by 2.5 per cent in the March quarter. This was the biggest fall in European GDP since records began in 1995. The fall in GDP was broad based with almost every component falling significantly. European consumer spending fell by 0.5 per cent in the quarter. This was the biggest fall in European consumer spending since records began. Household consumption contributed negative 0.3 per cent to European growth. These figures underline the severity of the global challenges we face. Every one of the major advanced economies is in recession - 24 of the 30 OECD countries are in recession and 29 of the 30 OECD countries have experienced at least one negative quarter of economic growth.Yesterday's national accounts data showed that the Australian economy grew in the March quarter by 0.4 per cent. In particular, household consumption grew by 0.6 per cent in the quarter to contribute 0.3 per cent to growth. Household consumption grew in every state and territory in Australia. If consumption had been as weak in Australia as it was in Europe, detracting 0.3 per cent rather than contributing 0.3 per cent to growth, Australia would be in recession. Indeed, Treasury figures confirm that without the cash stimulus payments Australian growth would have been negative 0.2 and Australia would have been in recession.It follows that the actions taken by the Australian government through its economic stimulus strategy and through its nation building for recovery plan mean that we have stood in the breach while the private sector is in retreat. The performance in consumption growth numbers for Australia has been significant. I would contrast those again with what has happened with consumption in the euro figures which I referred to before. I would also draw the House's attention to statements from the market economists, including the Chief Economist of CommBank, who said:The Q1 readings provide some further evidence that economic policy is gaining traction in Australia. Consumer spending proves surprisingly resilient to the array of negatives at work, suggesting that the cash handout component of fiscal stimulus was effective. Today's solid results suggest that fiscal and monetary policy stimulus has been overall effective in softening the Australian economic downturn. The cash transfer from the Commonwealth government to households last December enabled households to boost spending with a relatively healthy rise of 0.6 per cent in the quarter on quarter 1.There have also been comments to a similar effect from RBC Capital Markets and from the economist at Deutsche Bank.I would also draw the honourable member's attention and the House's attention to a letter signed by 21 Australian economists which was published yesterday in the Financial Review, among them Tony Cole, former Secretary to the Treasury; Max Corden, emeritus professor at John Hopkins University; Steve Dowrick, professor of economics at the ANU; Saul Eslake, Chief Economist of the ANZ Bank; Bernie Fraser, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and former Secretary to the Treasury; John Freebairn, professor of economics at the University of Melbourne; Stephen Grenville, former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank; and Nicholas Gruen, CEO of Lateral Economics. This is what the 21 economists had to say in relation to cash stimulus payments:There is no more effective way to stimulate the economy quickly. The success of this measure can be seen in the relative strength of Australian retail sales compared with almost any of our peers.Further, this is what the 21 economists had to say about debt and deficit:_ net debt will stay below 14 per cent of GDP compared with an average of over five times this in comparable countries __ even after the stimulus, we remain within a very healthy margin of safety in our government's reputation for economic prudence.Deploying our strong balance sheet to use otherwise idle resources - or to put it more compellingly, deserted factories and unemployed workers - to build assets that improve our lives and our economy in the future, seems much more appealing; much more commonsensical than retreating into phobias.These are the observations of these 21 economists. They are significant conclusions from mainstream economists and actually go to the heart of the responsible course of economic strategy which the government has embraced, which is a nation-building strategy for recovery.Obviously, to implement a nation-building strategy for recovery, it is necessary, given a global economic recession, to engage in borrowings, in deficit and in debt, as are most other economies in the world. That is the responsible course of action. But we are in the business of talking the Australian economy up and building the Australian economy up by this composite of measures. I would contrast our approach again to the tactics employed by those opposite, which are to consistently talk the Australian economy down.Again it is important to make sure that we have a strategy for the future which achieves the best and most positive growth performance for the Australian economy in the period ahead. We believe we are prosecuting that strategy on behalf of the nation. I commend this program for recovery to all members of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Let me just outline the events that took place so that we understand precisely where we are at. A letter from NIB seeking a meeting to discuss healthcare proposals was received by the Minister for Defence in late June last year. In accordance with the ministerial code of conduct, it would have been absolutely improper for the minister to deal with that correspondence and it was properly referred to me as the minister responsible for health in the Defence portfolio. The letter was referred to my office on 26 June at the direction of the minister.A preliminary meeting that included the CEO of NIB, Mr Mark Fitzgibbon, members of my staff and departmental staff from DVA and Defence was held on 3 July. A further meeting with representatives of NIB and Humana was held on 27 August. It was attended by Minister Griffin and me, along with staff from our offices and Major General Paul Alexander.Since that meeting, Defence has had no further contact with either company. I will just repeat that: since that meeting, Defence has had no further contact with either company. This was a matter which was rightly dealt with by me, not the Minister for Defence. I was the minister responsible for defence health and at all times behaved in accordance with the ministerial code of conduct.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question because I think it is a tribute to the Australian people that yesterday's national accounts figures show that our economy has outperformed other advanced economies, recording positive growth in the face of this very savage global recession - the worst global recession in 75 years, which has seen virtually every other advanced economy fall into a deep recession. Of course, this was evident yet again overnight, where the euro area contracted by a massive 2.5 per cent in the March quarter. This comes on top of big contractions elsewhere around the globe - four per cent in Japan, 1.9 per cent in the UK and 1.5 per cent in the US. So, at a time when virtually every other major advanced economy is going backwards, Australia is going forwards.This is a strong outcome for Australia that is a result of strong community effort and the government's economic stimulus. It is absolutely clear that the government's economic stimulus is working to support jobs and growth in our economy. It really shows what Australians can do when we all work together - when we pull together.We got a fair few examples today of the business community, for example, pointing to the vital impact and social and economic good that economic stimulus is doing. Michael Blythe, the Chief Economist for the Commonwealth Bank, said:The Q1 readings provide some further evidence that economic policy is gaining traction in Australia. Consumer spending proved surprisingly resilient to the array of negatives at work, suggesting that the cash handout component of fiscal stimulus was effective.And then we have Michael Luscombe, the CEO of Woolworths, who said:_ you have to give them a great deal of credit for getting on the front foot and making sure that the economy didn't stall.And from Westpac's Economic Update:The cash transfer from the Commonwealth government to households last December enabled households to boost spending _ as households largely spent the December cash payment.So those are the views from market economists and from the business community.But, as the Prime Minister and I have said, we are not out of the woods yet. There are some very big challenges ahead for us as a nation because the global recession will continue to batter our economy. We are seeing big adjustments in our economy and big challenges, particularly through the collapse in the terms of trade, in export earnings and in private investment. All of these trends, which were evident in the figures yesterday, will have big consequences for jobs and incomes in the Australian economy. That is why our nation-building plans for recovery, investments in infrastructure - road, rail, port, energy efficiency - investments in school modernisation, investments in social housing and so on are so absolutely essential. We still have a big challenge and a very big job ahead. But we are armed with a battle plan that will cushion this economy from the very savage impacts and worst impacts of this global recession.</DOC>

 - I refer the honourable member to my answer to his first question, which is firstly in relation to this individual and the contribution of a motor vehicle to my local electorate. That was fully declared on the Pecuniary Interest Register - that is the first point. Secondly, I am unaware of any representations being made on behalf of this individual concerning the program to which the minister refers. I said in response to the honourable member's first question that if there is anything further to add to that then I would provide him with an answer.Can I also say to the honourable member that, if he is leaping from one thing to another, the one recollection I have of a member of the public approaching me about their possible access to the car dealership finance arrangement was in fact a car dealership in the seat of Bennelong. It was at a small business function that I attended with the member for Bennelong. -  - No, the honourable member asked for an answer and I am giving him an answer. This representative said to me that they were experiencing difficulties in their car dealership and asked if the program was up and running. Upon my return to my office I mentioned that fact to my office. What subsequently occurred in relation to that individual car dealer I have no idea, but I actually said that this is what representation had been made to me. My recollection is that this is the only car dealer who has made such a representation to me; that is the occasion that I recall. If representations were subsequently made by my office concerning that particular dealership, it would be consistent with the representations that were made to me at that time. That is the sum total of my knowledge of it. If there were further to add to it, I would provide it to the honourable member rather than simply having the honourable member stand at the dispatch box and make insinuations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and I know that he is someone who has dedicated his life, both within and outside this parliament, to education. I am asked about our investment in TAFE. Can I say that TAFE is the engine room of skills development in this country. TAFE institutes around Australia have about 80 per cent of the training market. What TAFE is all about is jobs - preparing people for jobs, preparing them to get life's opportunities through access to work and preparing them to get better jobs as people go back to TAFE for retraining and reskilling. As a government we are committed to the further development of our TAFE sector. We know that it will be one of the main ways in which the nation provides the skills and opportunities that Australians need for the future. And in the forthcoming economic recovery we want Australians to be trained and ready for the new economic opportunities when the economy turns to stronger growth as we move into a new future.Mr Speaker, I invite you to compare this government's approach to investment in TAFE to that of the former government. I was asked about previous approaches, and I can summarise the approach of the former government very easily. If we look at the years 2005 to 2008 and the funding deal under the former government, they were investing in vocational education and training infrastructure $185 million per year - remember that figure - whereas the Rudd Labor government, in the year 2009 alone, is investing in VET infrastructure a staggering $897 million. Those are two figures that should be compared, and they say something very important about how we see TAFE and how we see skilling for the future. You would have to assume from the Howard government's approach to TAFE that the Howard government ministers did not understand that if you invest in TAFE infrastructure you are investing in jobs - you are investing in the jobs that you use to build the infrastructure and you are investing in jobs tomorrow because you give people an opportunity to train.But perhaps I am being a little unkind, because it has been drawn to my attention that there was one former Howard government minister, just one former Howard government minister, who did understand something about the connection between training and jobs. I am talking here about the member for Higgins, who has been engaged in a bit of job training himself. It was drawn to my attention - and it should be compulsory reading for all members of the House - that last week the member for Higgins delivered an adjournment address. This is a historic thing, because the last time the member for Higgins delivered an adjournment debate address was 17 years ago. Three Prime Ministers and 10 opposition leaders later, we have the member for Higgins delivering another adjournment address, having not served as Prime Minister or opposition leader for one day of the 17 years intervening. What is interesting about this adjournment address is that it is about the Liberal Party and its achievements and its leaders, but there is one leader's name you will not find referred to in the words of that adjournment address. - No. I am asked by the member for Hotham which one, and I can tell him the answer to the question. The member for Wentworth does not make an appearance in this adjournment address.I understand that the member for Higgins is engaging in a bit of training, and that is because I have seen the advertisement for the job he wants to apply for. There we have it, appearing in the pages of the newspaper. You might not have seen that, Prime Minister, but it says preselections are open, including for the member for Higgins's seat. What I am not sure about is if there is any truth in the rumour that in the next editions of the newspapers we will see an advertisement 'Position vacant: Leader of the Opposition', because that is the one he really wants to apply for.</DOC>

 - They have given up on the economy! It is true that the government established a special purpose vehicle to deal with problems in the financing of car dealerships. As a consequence of that, there have been numerous representations made to members of parliament from car dealers right around the country - numerous representations which have been forwarded on to my office and in turn forwarded on to the responsible officials in the Treasury for consideration. There is nothing abnormal about that. I know that the member for Riverina, for example, made some representations to my office about car dealers in her electorate. There have been numerous others, and I am sure that we can compile a list. It is an entirely normal thing that members of parliament or car dealers would contact the Treasury, which is establishing and putting in place this vehicle.It is the case that Mr Grant made representations to my office, and he was referred on to the SPV, just like everybody else. I have no idea what the outcome of that was. But it is entirely normal that, in circumstances where car dealers right around this country were potentially going to the wall, car dealers would have been ringing members of parliament, including the Treasurer's office, asking how they could make contact with this organisation in the Treasury establishing the vehicle. That is the situation - an entirely normal situation, as the Treasury officials have reported in estimates today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. As she may be aware, more than 50,000 direct payments have been made to families, pensioners and carers through the stimulus payments that this government has delivered over the last few months. It is important to note that all of us owe a very big thankyou to the families, pensioners and carers who have, as a result of these stimulus payments, been doing their bit to make sure that Australia did experience positive economic growth in the March quarter. Yesterday's national accounts showed that the government's cash payments did in fact find their mark and that was because families and pensioners spent at least a good proportion of those payments to keep household consumption positive. That has been very good news for this country.As the Prime Minister and Treasurer have said, we are not out of the woods by any means. We understand the impact of the global financial crisis. While we have been delivering these payments, we have been getting on with the next stage of our nation-building strategy for recovery and that includes a lot of work, particularly in the housing and construction industry. We know that many people - not including anybody opposite, of course, but economists, industry, pensioners and families - have very much welcomed these payments.Some of the people who welcomed the payments were pensioners who the member for Parramatta and I met just a couple of weeks ago. One pensioner told me that he knew of a number of his neighbours who had been able to the use the December payments to go and visit family that they had never been able to visit before. They had not had the money to do so before. Another lady at our afternoon tea told us a terrific story about how she had used her December payment to get some local tradies in to fix up her fence, get rid of some rubbish and get some landscaping done. Just in case the opposition misses the point of these stories from local pensioners in Parramatta, it was all about making sure that those local tradespeople had some extra work because pensioners had money to spend. That was actually the point of the payments. The pensioners did go out and spend the money and, as a result, local tradespeople in Parramatta had extra work.The opposition never trusted families or pensioners. They never thought that they should get these extra payments. They have been doing nothing short of wishing and hoping that the cash payments would not work. Now, of course, they find it very hard to admit that we have seen some early signs of the government's strategy working. We had the shadow Treasurer on Sky Agenda this morning. The journalist said to the shadow Treasurer, 'Do you concede the government's stimulus package has helped the Australian economy at all?' The interview went on:Hockey: Well, I think it is fair to say that, if you spend enough money, there will be some impact.Journalist: A positive impact, though?Hockey: Well, it must have had some impact.Can you believe it? The shadow Treasurer now says the government's strategy was always going to work. That is after they flip-flopped and did not know whether or not they supported the payments all during December and then in February they decided that they would vote against the payments. This is yet more evidence from the shadow Treasurer that it is all about political opportunism. The opposition have no idea whatsoever about how to deal with this terrible global financial crisis.</DOC>

 - As I said before, there is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary in members of parliament making representations on behalf of constituents to ministers' offices. There is nothing out of the ordinary in that at all. This occurred quite a bit around the time that many of these car dealerships looked to be in trouble and were not able to secure finance. So certainly there were numerous representations made to my office by members of parliament on behalf of car dealers. There will be members on the other side over there who made those representations. Secondly, it is absolutely nothing unusual for those representations to be then passed on to the department.I can say I have had no discussions with the Prime Minister about this matter whatsoever - none whatsoever. I am happy to look at what communications have taken place between my office and other offices. I am happy to do that, and I am sure there were a number of communications between my office and many over there. But, in the case of the Prime Minister and me, there were none.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. I note that, as a Victorian, she is interested in developments and I thought it was important, given the changes yesterday, to bring the House up to date with a range of new arrangements. As at noon today there are 639 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza , or swine flu, in Australia. There are 70 of those in New South Wales, 521 - the lion's share - in Victoria, 28 in Queensland, seven in South Australia, two in Western Australia, five in Tasmania, four in the ACT and two in the Northern Territory. I need to report that six Victorians have been hospitalised, but all are recovering well. Seventeen schools are currently closed: 12 in Victoria, four in Queensland and one in the Northern Territory. Most jurisdictions have now established flu clinics so that there is a particular place for people who are suffering flu-like symptoms to go and be assessed to see whether they have seasonal flu or H1N1 influenza. Globally there are now 66 countries affected, with 19,273 confirmed cases. Australia has about three per cent of those cases.There has been some speculation about whether there are any restrictions on travel either within Australia or to and from Australia. I need to make it clear to members who are getting queries from their electorate offices that there are no restrictions in place within Australia and there are no travel restrictions on people coming into or leaving Australia. Yesterday I did announce with the Chief Medical Officer that Victoria has moved to a modified sustained response, while the national alert level still remains at 'contain'. This has been done on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer and the Australian Health Protection Committee. These alert levels will continue to be reassessed daily as will, in particular, the different levels for different jurisdictions as they do cause some inconvenience to the public. I do need to emphasise as well that this different alert level for Victoria is likely to be transitional. It reflects an unusual distribution of these cases to date, but we expect very soon, in the coming days or weeks, that the rest of the country will similarly have more cases in their jurisdictions. At the moment we have that unusual distribution, with a high number of cases particularly in the northern suburbs of Melbourne.I want to emphasise that there are no restrictions on travel and no advice that adults should in any way delay or defer their travel within Australia. Restrictions are suggested for adults only if they are a confirmed case. Governments have not implemented any restrictions on domestic travel, either at the state level or nationally. We have a clear view, and this is based on the medical advice, that people should not change their travel decisions within Australia; it is easier for us to continue to respond sensibly and calmly. Given the relatively small number of cases, it is important that we encourage people to continue with their normal lives while taking appropriate personal precautions. As I have said on a number of occasions, the best way to contain the spread of any type of flu is for people to observe good hygiene practice.Members will be interested to know about the focus that all governments are putting on schools, particularly because they seem to be the environment where the disease spreads most easily. School-age children around the world seem to be being described as the superspreaders of this disease because of the type of contact they have with each other, and parents have been asked on a voluntary basis to keep their children at home if there is a risk that they have been exposed to the H1N1 influenza. Governments are continuing to implement a policy of voluntary exclusion from school for a period of seven days for all children returning from areas where there is a high prevalence of the virus circulating in the community. As it stands now, that high prevalence is in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. That will change over time, but people do not need to fear any travel within Australia; they just need to be aware of the impact and the voluntary request that will be made for children to stay away from school if they have visited in particular those areas most affected and been involved in activities and close contact with other school-aged children. All jurisdictions are now implementing random sampling testing, known as sentinel testing, of influenza-like symptoms within the community so that we can help to identify and monitor the spread of swine flu and any changes in the dominant circulating influenza strain as we get into the seasonal flu period as well.In the six weeks since the world first learnt of swine flu, the Australian government, with the help of the state and territory governments, has been acting thoroughly and consistently to ensure that our efforts go towards delaying the entry of the disease into Australia and containing its spread where possible, and we are now moving gradually to the phase where our focus will be on treating those who are most at risk in the community. Every day and every week that that delay in the spread of swine flu is successful gets us closer to the production of the vaccine, which of course will be distributed according to the latest information on whom this disease might be most harmful to.So far in Australia the experience has been that this disease is mild but has a hard edge. We need to be conscious that there will be some in the community, particularly those with respiratory problems, who will be vulnerable to this disease. I remind people that all our efforts will continue to jump on those cases, where they are identified, particularly if they are in settings where people are at risk.Anybody seeking information can still contact the swine flu hotline on 1802007. I am advised that it is receiving around 4,000 calls a day. Please be patient if you have any difficulties getting through. We have been advised that the information is proving very useful for parents who want information for their children or advice about when they should go and see a doctor.Australia is one of the best prepared countries in the world to deal with this sort of situation, but it is going to be a marathon effort. I would like to thank the community and particularly the health professionals for the excellent work that they have been doing and for the demands that will continue to be placed upon them as this disease spreads throughout the country.</DOC>

 - There would have been many, many representations to my office from members of parliament, and they would have been dealt with in a variety of ways. What you should do is go and talk to the Motor Trades Association about the deep interest there has been from car dealerships on this issue. By a variety of means these have all been referred on to OzCar, which by the way is the subject of legislation that has passed the House but still has not passed the Senate. If you wish to call officials back before the estimates committee to find out how many phone calls there were, how many representations there were and what incoming requests for information there were, go for your life, but you are up a dry gully.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The nation is challenged with the huge impact of the global economic recession and what to do about it in practical terms. You either stand back and sit on your hands and do nothing - the prescribed course of action on the part of those opposite - or you step up to the plate and seek to act and make a difference by stepping in while the private sector is in retreat. That is what the government have done. We have done so at multiple levels. We have done so by our investment in the economic stimulus strategy last October.In phase 1 we provided support through cash payments to pensioners, carers, veterans and later to families in order to provide a boost to domestic consumption at a time when consumption figures around the world were collapsing. The consequence of that is reflected in the most recent retail sales figures. Those figures put us light-years ahead of the rest of the world and have underpinned one of those drivers of demand that we saw reflected in the growth numbers, which were confirmed in the national accounts yesterday.Phase 2 of the government's economic strategy is for the government to invest in medium-term infrastructure - the biggest school modernisation program in the country's history, the biggest investment in social housing in the country's history and the biggest investment in home insulation and energy efficiency in the country's history - with the objective of making sure that we have provided every owner-occupied dwelling in the country with the opportunity to obtain ceiling insulation and thereby pull down greenhouse gas emissions by something like 50 millions tonnes of CO2 equivalent. These are practical measures for the future but, critically, they are also providing jobs today.Phase 3 of what we have sought to do is to invest in long-term infrastructure, nation-building infrastructure - rail, roads, ports, solar energy, clean energy, clean coal as well as desalination plants. There is also investment in a new national broadband corporation so that we can lay out the infrastructure we need for the 21st century and, on top of that, create economic incentive and opportunity on the way through.Phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 - what is our overall principle? To step up to the plate while the private sector is in retreat; nation building for recovery while the rest of the world is in retreat; nation building by supporting jobs, small business and apprenticeships today and by investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow.Also underpinning these measures - and I go directly to an element of the question which was just asked - are the actions taken by the government to assist with the stresses which have been placed on the financial sector. We acted decisively to provide a government guarantee for every single deposit holder in the country in banks, in building societies and in credit unions. Every person in the gallery today who is listening to the debate knows that their deposits are secure in their banks because of the government guarantee. For the first time in the history of the Federation, notwithstanding multiple recommendations to those opposite in their 12 years in office, we act in a parallel fashion.When it comes to necessary support for the flow of finance in the community, we have also been out there agreeing on other measures with the banks. We have the Australian Business Investment Partnership, ABIP. We have provided an alternative financial vehicle, a special purpose vehicle, conjointly invested in by the banks and by the Australian government with the purpose of providing necessary lines of credit - assuming commercial viability tests are passed - for the crucially important commercial property sector in Australia. It is capable of generating tens of thousands of jobs in this country. Of course, if projects collapse in that sector the unemployment consequences would be great as well.And then, of course, the other vehicle of which the government is proud is the special purpose vehicle we have created in the motor vehicle sector. We are proud of that as an Australian government initiative, despite the frustrations we are encountering in the Senate on this matter. Once again industry has come to government and said, 'How can you partner with the banks to make a difference?' We have done so and provided a vehicle that is open to all those out there in the critically important car dealership industry to ensure that we can provide support and incentive for them as well. That is what the government is doing by way of positive measures in the economy, positive measures to make a difference, to build the economy up rather than simply having it torn down by the negative language from those opposite.On the question of the special purpose vehicle, let me say in response to some of the insinuations that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition: (1) I have been advised that neither I nor my office have ever spoken with Mr Grant in relation to OzCar; (2) neither I nor my office have ever made any representations on his behalf; and (3) I have not been aware of any representations on his behalf made by anyone in the government, including the referral referred to before by the Treasurer's office.What we have here is the politics of fear about the economy being replaced by the politics of smear in this House by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has engaged in a deliberate smear in this place, without a single positive message to say about the future economic direction of this country. I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition stand at the dispatch box and apologise. -  - </DOC>

 - I am unaware of any such participation in the meetings referred to. In fact, I have just been advised by my office that no members of the Prime Minister's office attended any such meeting. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, as he pursues his campaign of fear and smear -  -  - The only one amused by the proceedings is the member for Higgins at the moment, because your credibility has just crumbled yet again. - A person who has stood at the dispatch box and made insinuations of the type which have been described before - the Leader of the Opposition, I would suggest, if he is a person of any moral substance, should stand at the dispatch box and register his apology for what has been said. -  -  - Furthermore, I find it curious that the member for Wentworth and the member for North Sydney, given their historical association with Goldman Sachs and HIH, would stand here and provide lectures on standards to the Australian parliament. I find it passing strange that those opposite, who come from the party which presided over the single-largest corruption scandal in Australian history, the wheat for weapons scandal, involving $300 million, for which not one minister answered with their ministerial career -  -  - I find it passing strange -  -  - I find it passing strange that those opposite would provide the House with a lecture on these sorts of standards, given where they have come from on these matters. This is the party of children overboard, the party which misled the Australian people on the eve of the 2001 election. This is the party which presided over the wheat for weapons scandal, the biggest corruption scandal in Australian history. This is the party which presided over the implosion of HIH. The then minister responsible for its regulation is now the shadow Treasurer and the member who is now the Leader of the Opposition was working at one stage for Goldman Sachs, a company which provided some corporate advice in relation to this matter. When it comes to ministerial standards and parliamentary standards, those opposite should reflect long and hard on the standards which they bring to bear in this debate today.Those opposite have nothing positive to say about the Australian economy, nothing positive to say about how we are going to take this country forward at a time of extraordinary global economic duress and nothing positive to say about what the country should do given the challenges that we face. Instead they are embarked upon a campaign of undiluted negativity. They should hang their collective heads in shame.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. The Alstonville bypass has indeed had a long history over the last decade. It is a history in which not much happened for a very long time. But in recent times - indeed, just a little over a month ago - work began on the Alstonville bypass and 140 people started work. It does have a history, though, and I am not the only one who has looked at the history of this project. The member for Warringah was on the doors this morning. He had the following to say about the history of the bypass:The Howard government first committed $12 million to the Alstonville bypass in 2002. Then the Alstonville bypass was costed by the state government at $24 million. The Howard government gave the state government $6 million but they didn't actually start any work.That is what he had to say this morning. You would think that, if you had made a commitment in 2001 to build a road and it was now 2009 and you had had two full terms to build the road, you would be embarrassed. You would not be going out there on the doors and talking about the promises. In spite of the commitment in 2001, nothing happened. Nothing happened in 2002, nothing happened in 2003 and nothing happened in 2004, 2005, 2006 or 2007. Nothing happened at a time when revenue was being returned to government coffers in record terms.But the coalition's opportunism is a character trait. It is not just the federal opposition that have that trait. The New South Wales Nationals leader, Andrew Stoner - and yesterday I quoted him praising the Kempsey bypass - had this to say this week. He said, 'The long-awaited Alstonville bypass has been dropped.' He must think they are still in government down here. He must think they are still in government, because it is not true. It is not only not true but it is going ahead fully funded by this government. There is a pattern of behaviour over there. They say: 'Oh, we were going to do something about Cooroy to Curra in our 13th year. We were going to do something about the Hunter Expressway in our 13th year. We were going to do something about the Kempsey bypass in our 13th year.' They went to election after election and made promises. If you go back and look at the funding, you will see there was nothing ever there in the budget. They are delusional not only about the past but about the present, and they have nothing to say about the future. The member for Groom also went out on the doors today, and this is what he had to say. He was asked:Can you stand here and tell us which infrastructure projects in your electorate that you oppose?The member for Groom said:Well, I haven't got any as far as I know.That is what he said. He said, 'I haven't got any.' He should log onto www.economicstimulusplan.gov.au, and there he will find 73 schools in the electorate of Groom, eight social housing units in the electorate of Groom, $4½ million for the regional and local Community Infrastructure Program, $1.6 million to install boom gates at two level crossings in his electorate and $4½ million to fix four black spots - three of which, because they were on the national network, he voted against when he voted for that ridiculous amendment moved by the Leader of the Nationals to remove any funding for black spots on the national road. They are in denial about the past, they are completely unaware of the current situation and they have absolutely nothing to say about Australia's economic future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I am reminded by the comments the Prime Minister made earlier concerning the AWB monopoly and its behaviour under the previous government to say it is about a year since this government abolished the AWB monopoly on exports. - In the lead-up to that news being received, we had some extraordinary stories of gloom and doom from the National Party as to how it would be received. We had the member for Calare, the shadow minister, describing it as economically irresponsible legislation, we had Senator Boswell saying that the new arrangements would throw an industry to the wolves of the international market, and we had the Leader of the National Party disagreeing with it on the basis that he wanted premiums for growing quality Australian wheat to go to Australian farmers and the Australian economy. But interestingly, since the reforms came in and growers started to get their returns and have the choice of who they would sell their wheat to, the Nationals went strangely quiet -  - In fairness, the member for Riverina never went strangely quiet; except for her, the National Party went strangely quiet. And there is a good story in exports at the moment for agriculture. The figures that have been released this week show rural exports having increased 18.3 per cent in the March quarter, and in particular the value of wheat exports having risen by 65 per cent to close to $1.7 billion in the quarter. And so I thought I would have a look at Wheat Exports Australia online and look at the actual marking down of what has happened to the National Party's predictions on whether or not Australia would get a better deal for wheat under the new arrangements. - You voted with us on this, okay, so do not get too angry! I know you do not always remember how you voted, but you voted with us. You might have a National Party member either side of you, but you did not vote with them on this one.We have on the bulk wheat exports the different prices between what you get on the west coast of Australia and what you get on the east coast of Australia. Wheat Exports Australia, in the information they have provided, have graphs on the three different markers: the Chicago Board of Trade for the international price, the Fremantle price and marker for the west coast price and Newcastle for the east coast price. Before these reforms were introduced, the Chicago price was consistently above what we were getting on the east coast of Australia or the west coast of Australia. But since growers were given a choice as to whom they wanted to sell to, first of all you find that on the east coast of Australia prices have gone up to close to parity with the Chicago price. -  - But in Western Australia there has been a $35 a tonne premium above what they were previously getting, above the Chicago marker, since this was introduced. -  - Now this is why the party -  - It is no surprise that the party that has representatives from Western Australia - not the National Party - knew that this legislation was the right thing to vote for. At this point in question time, I would like to say something nice about the Liberal Party. -  - No, I would. On this issue they voted against the Nationals. That was the compliment. That will be as good as it gets. But on this issue it was a real compliment, because the National Party, for the sake of the local agripolitics that they get involved with, were willing to see the AWB monopoly continue to behave as it was and see Australian farmers suffer lower prices as a result. And yet, time and again, that is the judgment that the Liberal Party are willing to defer to. But they were not willing to defer when this bill came up, and that is why, when they are willing to exercise a judgment independent of the National Party, we end up with a situation where we get decent legislation and Australian farmers get a premium.But that sort of judgment will never be the judgment that the coalition has as its standard. People on the other side who take an interest in agriculture who are from the Liberal Party - like the member for Groom, the member for the Forrest and the member for Farrer - never get the agriculture portfolio on that side because, due to a mad coalition arrangement, consistently they decide that the party with the fewest country seats should get the total call on agricultural policy. And as long as they keep that deal, it will be a deal that lets Australia's farmers down.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I will take the question that the honourable member has asked. My office advises that I do not claim money in lieu of a vehicle. I have an electorate car. It is a Toyota Prius. It is in Canberra, as per the entitlement, because that is where I happen to live. The opposition know that because they have asked questions on notice about it. Furthermore, in terms of the vehicle supplied by Mr Grant, it is a ute for the purposes of mobile offices. It has on the side of it 'Kevin Rudd's mobile office' and I have used it for quite a number of years.</DOC>

 - They are just trying to encourage me, Mr Speaker. I do thank the member for her question and for her interest in small business. As I said yesterday, there is a lot of interest in small business on our side of the parliament, and it is now one year and one day since I had a question from the member for Moncrieff, the shadow small business minister. I have had reason to celebrate the reaction of the small business community to the small business tax break. I take the opportunity to thank the Prime Minister for decisions that he and the Treasurer made in the budget context. In going to forums around Australia with small businesses, I firstly ascertained that the previous small business tax break, though very popular, did warrant some further consideration in the respect that businesses were saying that it had not passed the Senate and they were worried that it might go the way of alcopops, and therefore they were holding back. Secondly, a proportion of small businesses did not know about it. When I approached the Treasurer and the Prime Minister with these two issues, the decision was made to extend the operation of the small business tax break to the end of this calendar year, to 31 December, and, further, to boost that tax break from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.This is just one of the measures that the government has adopted, not only to boost small business investment but also to boost small business confidence. I am pleased to advise the House that the business groups around Australia strongly support the government's small business initiatives. I will take the opportunity to refer to the support that has come from the Australian Retailers Association. The director of the Australian Retailers Association had this to say about the budget initiatives:Retailers applaud budget support for small businessThat was the heading, and it describes a small business tax break as:_ direct incentive for smaller retailers _ to inject much needed investment in their business.The Australian Retailers Association concludes:These initiatives coupled with the Rudd Government's stimulus packages, which are beginning to flow from consumers pockets through to retailers, leave retailers optimistic the Rudd Government is listening to their concerns and supporting small business.It may interest members to know that the Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association is Richard Evans. Richard Evans was the Liberal member for the seat of Cowan - you may remember that, Mr Speaker - between 1996 and 1998. We would not always agree with Mr Evans, and I am sure that he will be critical of the government in the future, as he has been in the past, but he can be optimistic about Australia's future. If the Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association can be optimistic about Australia's future, why can't the Leader of the Opposition? Why can't the Liberal member for Wentworth be optimistic about Australia's future? Why does he insist on talking the economy down when we are trying to talk the economy up? Just yesterday, the same former Liberal member for the seat of Cowan said:_ at the moment, there is a lot of good economic news and retailers are predicting improved growth from the September quarter.There we have the Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association talking up the economy. He is not alone, as there is a whole litany of business representatives who are talking up the economy. Michael Luscombe, Woolworths chief executive, and Mark McInnes, David Jones chief executive, are both saying that the stimulus packages have been terrific and are both saying that the outlook for the Australian economy is a very positive one. Paul Brennan, the head of economics at Citigroup, is saying the same thing. Andrew McKellar, the CEO of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, said:There is clear evidence that the Federal Government's business tax break is providing the market with a renewed sense of optimism and confidence.Then there is Greg Evans, the acting chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. One after the other, 21 economists from all over Australia - including former governors and deputy governors of the Reserve Bank - from all different political persuasions are all saying that we are on the right track, that the government, through its stimulus package, is doing the right thing by the Australia people and the right thing by small businesses.Yet we have this miserable lot over here always talking the economy down, exaggerating the unemployment figures, as they did when Senator Coonan, the shadow finance minister, said that there were 155,000 jobs lost a couple of months ago - and it was nothing like that. It was the same thing with the shadow Treasurer saying that there were 80,000 jobs lost - and it was nothing like that. They are always talking the economy down. Today, on Sky Channel, the shadow Treasurer was asked this question. He was critical, yet again, of the government's stimulus package. When asked about this he said, 'Well, we would have a smaller stimulus package.' He was asked this question: 'Okay, can you say that the economy would not be in recession with your alternative stimulus package?' Do you know what he said? He said, 'I don't know - we don't know.' We do not know whether the economy would be in recession under their economic policies. Well, you should know.If you are going to implement policies like these, if you are going to implement policies to halve the stimulus package, come into this parliament and say: 'We don't know. We don't know whether there would be a recession or not.' These things matter. These things matter to the Australian people. It matters whether there is a recession or not. It seems as if it does not matter to the opposition leader and it does not matter to the shadow Treasurer, but it certainly matters to the Australian people. These are human beings - these are decent Australians - and 210,000 more Australians would have lost their jobs with the economic policies being advocated by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer.Time and time again they are talking the economy down. Get with the government. Get with the strength. Get with the Australian people. Support small business in this country. You are a disgrace to the Liberal Party, an absolute disgrace! You have made a mockery of the once great Liberal Party. -  - Get in and support small business and support Australia. Support the government's initiatives and be responsible, instead of talking the economy down. - </DOC>

 - Let it be known that this is the day that the Liberal Party hauled up the white flag on the economic policy debate. Let it be known that, barely two weeks after the budget, this is the day that the Liberal Party hauled up the white flag on the economic policy debate for the nation and instead decided to go the low road. We have moved from the politics of fear to the politics of smear. Unfortunately both of these things are traditional strengths of the Liberal Party. We have seen them deployed in the past; it seems we will see them both deployed in the future.I noticed that, in the question just posed by the honourable member, he referred to an official residence, Kirribilli. I seem to remember that Kirribilli was used for a particular purpose by the Liberal Party and their office. It was called fundraising. I remember also that when it came to official establishments in general they were used for fundraising purposes. The Lodge and Kirribilli were used to fundraise for the Liberal Party. They were used to derive funds to support the election or re-election of members represented on those benches opposite. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: does he regard that as an appropriate standard? -  - I also draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition, given that he is now a custodian of the high standards of this place as reflected by his contributions in many fields prior to coming to this place, to the fact that on the question of the official establishments which he just drew attention to in his question, the decision that my wife and I have taken in relation to Kirribilli is to throw it open for charitable fundraising. I would simply make the point of contrast that on a regular basis charitable organisations use Kirribilli to raise money for charities which deliver services to Australians in need. Mission Australia and others are there every month or so, raising money, deservedly, for deserving organisations. It seems that the definition of a deserving organisation, when those opposite were in power, was the Liberal Party.Australians expect in this time of global economic crisis that we will actually engage in a debate about the future of the country, about people's jobs and whether they have security of employment, about small businesses struggling to get finance, about car dealerships trying to stay afloat and about businesses out there in the economy trying to secure finance for their operations. This government has acted with every peak industry body in the country - the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Business Council of Australia; the Australian Industry Group; the small business organisation, COSBOA; and those bodies representing other industries across Australia - and do you know why? It is because we are in the business of making a difference for people at a time of extraordinary economic duress. We have a positive plan for the country's future. We intend to build the Australian economy up, and I say to those opposite: you are seeking to talk the economy down.</DOC>

 - I can advise the House that yesterday the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service dismantled a major international drug-trafficking syndicate. Six arrests were made. There were five people arrested in Sydney and one arrest was made in Canberra. The seizure included 200 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. It also included 1,860 litres of precursor material contained in eight 44-gallon drums. That precursor material was sufficient to make 150 kilograms of methamphetamine worth some $15 million on the streets. The operation followed seven months of extensive work between the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service resulting in conspiracy charges against the members of the alleged syndicate. The operation represents an outstanding example of cooperation between our law enforcement and border protection agencies and I remind the House that it comes on top of the four tonnes of ecstasy that were seized late last year, which was a world-record seizure. And, in addition, at that time a substantial amount of cocaine was seized.This is a serious warning to those who would attempt to import prohibited substances. They will be stopped, they will be charged and they will be prosecuted to the full force of the law. I conclude by congratulating all those involved in the operations, led at the Australian Federal Police level by the National Manager - Border and International, Ramsay Gabor, all officers of the Australian Federal Police and members and officers of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Let's go to the facts of what the Commonwealth Bank actually said. They said:The cheaper funding we had _ prior to the crisis is rolling off and is being replaced by this more expensive source of funding.The cost of raising funds from offshore wholesale markets was still 12 times higher than it was before the credit crisis.That is: offshore. - Let me go to the issue of offshore wholesale markets. Firstly, the cost of bank finance, as the member for North Sydney would be aware, is set in offshore global markets. Presently, in offshore bond markets we have something like $84 trillion on issue. The fraction of that which the Australian bond market, the Australian debt market, issues is 0.001. That is fact 1. Let us just put that into some context.Secondly, the honourable member asks about the impact of Australian government actions in relation to rates. Can I say that one of the principal decisions taken by the government, for which we were criticised by many of those opposite, was the decision to provide a guarantee on interbank lending in the wholesale finance market to banks.I would draw the honourable member's attention to the following. On 12 December 2008 the CBA issued guaranteed bonds at a total price, including the 70 basis point guarantee price, of 160 basis points above the bank bill swap rate. As of 14 April 2009 - that is, after the government's guarantee came into operation - the spread on the CBA issue was down to 123 basis points. In fact, if you look more broadly at the impact on money market spreads as a consequence of the government's direct intervention in the marketplace to support banks with the interbank guarantee, it runs as follows: following the collapse of Lehman Brothers the spread increased to 142 basis points; after the government introduced the guarantees credit spreads had fallen to 80 basis points by the end of November, to 75 basis points by the end of December, to 34 basis points by the end of March and to 21 basis points by the end of May. I would suggest that the honourable member reflects on that in terms of the basis of his question as well.The other thing I would draw to the honourable member's attention is the relevance of the government's actions in the marketplace to support the interbank guarantee in terms of the banks actual take-up of this guarantee in their international borrowing. And I would draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that, in the crisis period of October-November last year, interbank lending effectively collapsed to virtually zero. In fact, the total raisings by Australian banks in November last year were $0.14 billion - that is, practically zero. After we introduced the guarantee - which came into operation, from recollection, Treasurer, in early December - we had those raisings increase to $23 billion, $28 billion, $19 billion, $8 billion et cetera.But here is the critical point for the benefit of the honourable member who has asked the question: the extent to which the banks have relied upon the guarantee for their actual raisings. In December last year 98 per cent of the overall raisings by the banks were underpinned by the government guarantee; in February it was 93 per cent, in March it was 86 per cent, in April it was 65 per cent and in May it was 53 per cent. In terms of the normalisation of credit markets - that is, assisting banks to raise money offshore - from where we had collapsed to zero in November last year, we have had a restoration to these levels of raisings. Most critically, more then half since then - and, in the early months, practically all - have depended upon the government guarantee, producing the contraction in spreads that I referred to before.Therefore, I would suggest to the honourable member as to the basis of his question: (1) Australia's public bond issue represents a fraction of 0.001 of the total bond issue which is alive globally - and it is the global bond market that shapes the offshore financial markets which determine credit price (2) spreads have changed and (3) banks have relied upon the actions of this government.Finally, I ask the honourable member who has asked this question about interest rates to simply reflect on where interest rates stood under the previous government as opposed to where they stand under this government. Under the previous government we had 10 interest rates rises in a row - a total rise of 250 basis points, costing an average family more than $400 per month - and interest rates were at their highest point in a decade. That is what we inherited. I would contrast that with those opposite in the following way: since the government have been in office families have benefited from six interest rate cuts - a total of 425 basis points - and interest rates are now at their lowest point in more than 50 years, which will save the average family with a $300,000 mortgage around $750 a month, or $9,000 a year. So I suggest to the honourable member that he look at some basic comparisons. Let us look at where the CBA rate stood when the Liberals left office - at 8.55 per cent. Where does it stand today? At 5.74 per cent. That represents a fundamental difference between interest rates as the existed under the previous government and where they exist today.Therefore, I would suggest to the honourable gentlemen that, when he poses questions like this, he reflect upon (a) interest rate performance under the previous government relative to what is occurring now (b) how interest rates and the cost of capital are actually shaped by offshore credit markets, as underpinned in the correct rendering of the statement by the CBA and (c) the impact that the government guarantee has had on spreads and on the actual uptake of interbank lending courtesy of the government's provision of that guarantee, which was much criticised.I will conclude by saying this: as those opposite talk about the impact of the 10 basis point rise by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, on which point the Treasurer and I and others have reflected the government's fundamental disappointment, those opposite, and the Leader of the Opposition in particular, should reflect carefully on what he had to say when there was a 25 basis point rise not all that long ago. When interest rates went up in August 2006 by 25 basis points the Leader of the Opposition said at the time, 'I think the interest rate hike has been overdramatised.' Furthermore, on the question of interest rates, the Leader of the Opposition has also said much more recently - I think as shadow Treasurer:Banks are free to price their products as they wish. After all, they are in the business of making profits and, all things being equal, they will charge as much for every product they have on offer as the market will allow them.That is obviously the philosophy - the free market fundamentalist philosophy - represented by the Leader of the Opposition. He says that that is what occurs out there in interest rate markets. I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition reflect carefully (a) on what he has said about how interest rate markets operate (b) on the relative performance of interest rate pricing and cost under the government of which he was a part for such a long period of time as compared to what applies now and (c) how actual prices are set.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for this question. The government has embarked on a course of action based on early and decisive action to support jobs and to cushion our economy from the worst impacts of the global recession.I refer the attention of the House to what we had produced in the last week in terms of the most recent consumer sentiment index, which was up 12 per cent in June. This is the largest increase in 22 years. Consumer sentiment is now up 20 per cent since the announcement of the government's first economic stimulus package in October and, furthermore, the consumer sentiment index is now at its highest level since January 2008. That covers consumer sentiment, but then, of course, we have business confidence, which has also risen. Business confidence for May showed the sharpest rise that we have seen since 1989. It has now reached its highest level since February 2008. Furthermore, we saw other positive economic data in the housing sector, with housing finance growing by 3.5 per cent in April. First home buyers in particular represent an increased proportion of that total amount, indicating that people are responding positively to the trebling of the first home owners boost.I was asked by the honourable member about the economic recovery - that is, our efforts to support an economic recovery in Australia and to lift Australia from the global economic recession. The data suggests that as of now - while there are still many difficulties lying ahead - Australia is performing better than most other countries during this global recession, the worst in three-quarters of a century. Firstly, on the matter of economic growth, if you look at the data itself, Australia has the fastest growth in the OECD. In the March quarter we saw the following growth in some other economies: Japan, negative 3.8 per cent; the UK, negative 1.9 per cent; the US, negative 1.5 per cent; Canada, negative 1.4 per cent; France, negative 1.2 per cent; Germany, negative 3.8 per cent; Italy, negative 2.6 per cent; and Australia grew in the March quarter by 0.4 per cent. Against those measures the Australian economy is performing relatively well.On unemployment, Australia on the most recent data has the second lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies: in the UK it is 7.1 per cent; the US, 9.4 per cent; Canada, 8.4 per cent; France, 9.1 per cent; Germany, 8.2 per cent; Italy, 6.9 per cent; in Australia it is 5.7 per cent - still too high - and in Japan it is 5 per cent.On debt, Australia has the lowest net debt of the major advanced economies. To again go through the numbers: Japan, 103 per cent of GDP; the UK, 56.8 per cent; the US, 61.7 per cent; Canada, 26.2 per cent; France, 65.2 per cent; Germany, 70.9 per cent; Italy, 111.9 per cent; and the major economies have an average of 70.4 per cent of GDP. Australia's debt is currently forecast to be 4.6 per cent in 2009-10 rising to 13.8 per cent.On the matters of deficits, Australia has a lower budget deficit than the average of the major advanced economies in 2009. The figures are: Japan, minus 9.9 per cent; the UK, 9.8 per cent; the US, 13.6 per cent; France, 6.2 per cent; Germany, 4.7 per cent; Italy, 5.5 per cent; and their average is 10.4 per cent. Canada is at minus 3.4 per cent and Australia is at minus 4.9 per cent. - The member for Sturt is obviously not keen on hearing this data. But it is important that the House reflect on the fact that every one of the major advanced economies has fallen into recession and Australia has not. I say to those opposite that, therefore, when it comes to economic growth, Australia is the fastest among the major advanced economies and with unemployment we have the second lowest of the major advanced economies. On top of that our net debt is the lowest of the major advanced economies and our deficit is the lowest of the average of the major advanced economies. These are the data which represent the impact not just of government policy action but also of the decisive contribution by individuals in the Australian economy as well - the men and women of business and small business in particular.We have some 35,000 construction projects currently underway across the country. These are important projects for the nation. I notice in this respect that there is a debate within the Australian community about the future of the nation's construction sector. The building and construction sector is critical for the economy. While this sector is full of hardworking and law-abiding people helping Australia to build towards recovery, there are also plainly problems. There has been a history of violence and threats of violence in parts of this sector and these cannot be ignored and nor will they be ignored. There is a determination within the Australian government to get this right. We will honour our election commitments and have indeed a tough cop on the beat. We will honour this commitment in a fair and responsible way for the sector, for the economy and also, most importantly, to support economic recovery.We are not out of the woods yet. There is much work to be done. The government's strategy is to lift the economy up through nation building for recovery. I would again contrast that with the strategy embraced by those opposite, which is to continue to talk the economy down.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. He is acutely embarrassed by the jobs performance of our stimulus package. It is playing a vital role in supporting employment in the Australian economy. Both he and the Leader of the Opposition were acutely embarrassed when the national accounts figures came out the week before last, because what they showed was that it was our stimulus that was promoting growth, employment and business in the Australian community.When you listen to the shadow Treasurer, you would think that there was some alternative. We have this dishonest campaign about deficits and borrowing when the truth is that we know that they would borrow not one cent less than us and that they would not pay it back one day earlier. We know that. Last Sunday week, there was an embarrassing performance by the shadow Treasurer with Laurie Oakes. Laurie Oakes asked him this:But, if you'd been in government, you also would have lost $210 billion from your forward estimates wouldn't you? So, do you concede that you would have had to borrow that amount if you were in government?The shadow Treasurer replied:No way Laurie, no way.What a completely ridiculous claim: 'There's no global recession; it has no impact on the revenues. No way, Laurie; no loss of revenue at all.' Laurie Oakes went on to ask him this very obvious question:So you'd be spending $210 billion less over that period?The shadow Treasurer replied:No, no, not at all. - Exactly. And it relates to the level of borrowings that this government has had to make responsibly to support our economy and to support employment in the middle of a global recession. Mr Oakes said:So you'd be spending $210 billion less over that period?Hockey said:No, no, not at all.So there would be no global recession, they would have less deficit and debt and they would be able to do that without spending a cent less. Talk about a magic pudding!The truth is that we have had to borrow responsibly to cover the revenue collapse brought on in this country - imposed on this country - by a global recession and to support employment to give us the outcomes that we got in the national accounts the week before last and to give us the consumer confidence figures that the Prime Minister was talking about before. - What we saw in the embarrassment on Laurie Oakes's program is that there is no alternative policy. None of them - not one of the entire frontbench - has an alternative policy. All they have is a dishonest scare campaign about deficit and debt. It is about time that they came clean and admitted that if they were in government they would have to borrow as much as the government has had to borrow to support employment in the Australian economy. But they are so opportunistic. They are so concerned with their own political futures that they are not concerned with the national interest. We published for everybody to see in our budget all of our figures; all of our estimates. Because they are inconvenient for their fake political position, they cannot wear them.On this side of the House, we are proud of the budget that we brought down. We are proud of the role that it is playing in supporting employment. There are 200,000 more Australians in employment as a consequence of our budget. That is 200,000-plus people in employment who would not have been in employment if it had not been for our budget. That is their embarrassment; that is what they cannot admit to. That is why their dishonest campaign is there for everybody to see.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I know that she would be very delighted that jobs in her local economy are being supported through the economic stimulus plan. There are over 1,133 projects in her electorate, and 87 of these projects are at 61 of her local schools under the Building the Education Revolution program. This contribution in Cunningham is part of the biggest school modernisation program the nation has ever seen. Over the next 12 months there will be 23,000 projects in about 9,500 schools around the country - a huge national effort to support jobs today whilst we build the infrastructure we need for tomorrow.Mr Speaker, you and others in the House may have seen some recent publicity about the guidelines for the Building the Education Revolution and some claims relating to expenditure in particular schools. Can I make this position very clear for the House: the guidelines for the Building the Education Revolution are clear; they are available publicly on the website; and they have certainly been absorbed by school communities who want to benefit their schools under this program. In particular, the Building the Education Revolution guidelines have required that, wherever it is possible, local tradespeople are engaged for the work. Preference must also be given to businesses that have demonstrated a commitment to adding or retaining trainees and apprentices. The guidelines also state that, wherever possible, new buildings and refurbishments should incorporate sustainable building principles and be designed to maximise energy efficiency. The guidelines are also clear that, for planned amalgamations, the indicative funding allocation for the school to be merged can be combined and used for capital or refurbishments in the new school. We are working cooperatively with state and territory authorities and with the independent and Catholic school systems to deliver this huge modernisation program. -  - The opposition are catcalling about this because they do not support and have never supported this investment in schools. Mr Speaker, you may have seen, as other members of the parliament may have seen, some very specific claims made on 12 June in the Australian, where it was alleged that funding was being handed to schools slated for closure or amalgamation. - I hear the shadow minister yell out 'Gepps Cross'. I am coming to that in just a moment, and he will be very interested in the facts. Firstly, the guidelines in relation to schools that are due to be closed or amalgamated are clear -  - The member for Sturt will be very interested in the answer, given his interjections. He should just wait one little minute and some things will become clear to him. The guidelines are clear in relation to schools that are due to be closed or amalgamated. - No funding is going to schools that are in the process of, or were planned for, closure. The guidelines in this respect are exactly the same as those of the Investing in Our Schools guidelines - exactly the same. Of course, states and territories and block grant authorities were asked to advise the Commonwealth of any schools earmarked for closure when they provided their enrolment data to the Commonwealth in February 2009. In some cases when we published the names of successful schools under the Building the Education Revolution, the state, in their application, named the school that was amalgamating. Let me just make the facts very, very clear - so clear that the opposition -  - The member for Sturt will now be very interested in this fact, and he will come to the dispatch box and no doubt apologise for that interjection. Let me make the facts very clear. The Australian reported on 12 June that Inala West State School, which is amalgamating with Inala State School, would be receiving $125,000 for classroom upgrades. The fact is that, as Inala West State School is to be closed and amalgamated with Inala State School, 100 per cent of the funding will go to Inala State School - the continuing school - for classroom upgrades. The Australian reported on 12 June that Richlands State School, which is amalgamating with Richlands East State School, would be receiving $75,000 for classroom upgrades. The fact is that 100 per cent of this funding will go to Richlands East State School - the school that is continuing. The Australian reported on 12 June that Dinmore State School, which is amalgamating with Riverview State School, would be receiving $75,000 for classroom upgrades. The fact is that 100 per cent of this funding will go to Riverview State School - the school that is continuing. The Australian reported on 12 June that Bremer State High School, which is moving to a new site, would be receiving $200,000 for revegetation and a fitness track. The fact is that these facilities are for the new site. The Australian reported on 12 June -  - and I am sure the shadow minister will be interested in this - that Gepps Cross Primary School, before it merges into a new superschool in 18 months time, will be receiving $125,000 to be spent on fixing a toilet block. The fact is that the Building the Education Revolution funds for Gepps Cross Primary School were approved for information and communication technology at the amalgamated site and the funds will be used for this purpose. The South Australian Department of Education and Children's Services has advised my department that the school will not be using any Building the Education Revolution funds to fix toilets and drainage and that any maintenance for toilets and drainage would be funded by the state government. The fact here -  - Obviously the shadow minister for education, caring nothing about education, does not want to listen to the answer - and the facts are perfectly clear. These vital resources are being delivered to schools which are continuing and which will educate students. The members of the opposition might think that is something to be laughed about; they might think that building 21st century infrastructure for Australian schools is all a bit of joke; they might think it is appropriate to come into this House and vote against it; they might think it is appropriate to go on the media and describe it as a low-quality spend; and then they might have the hypocrisy to try and get themselves in the photo when these funds are announced at local schools. But the Australian community know that this program is benefiting local schools, building the infrastructure they need for the 21st century and supporting local jobs.This is a huge national mobilisation effort - $14.7 billion is unashamedly being delivered quickly to support jobs today during the global recession. People of goodwill around the country are turning their hands to make sure that this money is delivered in the form of construction sites and that it supports jobs right around the country. We will continue to work with those people of goodwill. We understand that from time to time in a program of this size there will be complaints and concerns. We have responded to a number of those. All we ask in the course of this process is that people of goodwill continue to work together to get the program delivered, and obviously we would prefer if, when reporting on these matters, there was some accuracy in the reports.</DOC>

 - My answer is as it was the last time the honourable member raised this question because that is the advice I have received from my office. Furthermore, can I say to the honourable member that, since this particular vehicle was provided by the individual concerned, the declaration on pecuniary interest was made. The ute was valued at around $5,000; it was put in my pecuniary interest statement on 3 July 2007, as is required by the Commonwealth parliament. Furthermore, I would say to the honourable member that, in terms of representations that have been made by various members in this place, I am also advised that in addition to the car dealer from Sydney who spoke to me, Mr Kaplan, from Hunter Holden in Sydney, which I referred to the other day in answer to the honourable member's question, there have also been representations to the government from the member for Riverina, the member for Dunkley, the member for Murray and, of course, the member for Dawson as well. It is entirely normal for representations to be made to OzCar because this is the sort of thing that members of parliament are required to do if they are asked to actually get out there and support the industry.The reason this particular facility existed was that we were approached as a government by the industry at the end of 2008 about the collapse in normal supplies of motor vehicle finance. As a consequence of that, the government took the view that a co-investment vehicle, a special-purpose vehicle, between ourselves and the banks was an appropriate way to step into the marketplace and to provide, therefore, an alternative source of finance. We have also been advised that, had we not done so, the impact that would have had in terms of confidence across the industry would have been significant. Therefore, I would say this has been a worthwhile measure on the part of the government, and any member of this place, if they are approached by a business seeking to access a government program, would be entirely entitled to make representations. But to go back to the honourable member's question: the advice that I received from my office remains current on the matter which the honourable member raises.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his very important question. It is the case that the No. 1 priority of the government is jobs - to support Australian jobs in the face of this most savage global recession. Of course, the economic stimulus that we have put in place is expected to reduce the forecast peak in the unemployment rate by 1½ percentage points and it will support up to 210,000 more jobs over the period ahead. That is something the government is very proud of. It is important for us to invest in nation-building infrastructure, to support employment and to support business given the fact that there is a withdrawal of private investment and given the collapse in the terms of trade - the dramatic reduction in national income. All of those reasons make it very important that our stimulus, through phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3, continues. That means we do need to borrow responsibly to support employment and to support Australian businesses. The fact that 210,000 Australian families with breadwinners benefit from that is very important. We should not underestimate the cost to the economy if the unemployment rate were to go up even higher.Treasury estimate that, without economic stimulus, total employee incomes over the next decade would be around $100 billion lower. As a result, budget revenues from less income tax alone would be about $23 billion lower. Of course, spending on unemployment benefits would be about $4 billion higher over the next four years and of course the number of long-term unemployed would be higher. All of those things come at a tremendous cost to the economy.But, in this discussion about stimulus and what it does, we should also focus on the human cost of unemployment - what cost is passed on to the economy through the break-up of families and through the impact on local communities. Every job lost is one too many, which is why the government is so determined to put in place its economic stimulus to support employment and to support businesses. We have heard in the House, particularly from the Deputy Prime Minister earlier, just how important the investment is in schools and just how important the investment is in social housing, in clean energy and so on - to support employment while at the same time leaving a lasting legacy for the country. This government is absolutely determined to be on the front foot, to put in place positive plans for the future so that it can support employment and make our economy and country a far better place.</DOC>

 - I think the member for Lindsay for his question. Could I also wish the member for Higgins well on his departure. It is always a sad day when parliament loses a dedicated Essendon supporter, although the Minister for Trade may not agree with that, and I wish him well. The government has put in place an economic strategy built around stimulating economic activity in various sections of the economy in order to take up the slack being left by the global contraction that is hitting the entire world. In doing so, we are sustaining approximately 210,000 jobs and countless businesses that otherwise would go under as a result of the global recession. That stimulus is going through payments as to maintenance of school buildings, construction of new school buildings, construction of new homes and construction of new road, rail and other projects. That stimulus strategy has received widespread support throughout the community including from most sections of the business community. But, sadly, that support has not been universal. It is particularly disappointing that the opposition not only has refused to support the government's economic stimulus strategy but has continued to snipe at it in an even more hysterical and unfounded way.But last Friday the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, broke his own previous world record for silliness when he blamed the Commonwealth Bank's increase of 0.1 per cent in its interest rates on the government's stimulus package. I note that this was coming from a former cabinet minister from a party that when in government promised to keep interest rates at record lows and then delivered 10 interest rate increases in a row. I note also that a respected economics commentator and member of the press gallery described these claims as 'bizarre garbage'. I think that is a very apt description of the accusation that the shadow Treasurer made.The factor that has been driving the separation of market interest rates from official Reserve Bank of Australia interest rates over the past 12 months or so is universally acknowledged as the turbulence on international financial markets, on global financial markets. That is certainly the reason that the Commonwealth Bank has advanced for the position that it has taken with respect to its market interest rates: the higher cost of wholesale funding flowing through from international financial markets into market interest rates in Australia. In effect, the position being taken by the shadow Treasurer and being endorsed implicitly by the Leader of the Opposition today says that projected Australian government borrowing, the vast bulk of which has yet to occur, is pushing up interest rates in global financial markets and that is crowding out private sector activity in global financial markets. Any examination of the facts will demonstrate that this cannot be the case because the Australian proportion of total global government borrowing is extremely small, as the Prime Minister outlined before, and Australia has the lowest projected debt profile of all of the major developed economies in the world.It is interesting to note, if you want to follow their arguments and if you want to follow through the logic of some of their statements, and also it is always worth referring back to what the opposition said a little while ago. In effect, what they are saying at the moment is that the government is borrowing in order to finance stimulus payments and that that borrowing is crowding out the ability of Australia's banks to finance lending and as a result they have to push up interest rates. It is not that long ago that an opposition member stood here telling us that those same payments were not going to be spent. They were going to be saved. They were going to end up with the banks. They were going to end up in people's bank accounts. So somehow or other the banks are losing money as a result of borrowing for the stimulus payments which are ending up with the banks, according to the position of the opposition. The same person has also said that, should the opposition be elected and were it in office tomorrow, it would maintain the government's stimulus strategy. With Laurie Oakes eight days ago, when asked about this issue, the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, said that it was hard to unscramble the egg and that the opposition, were it to become the government tomorrow, would maintain the government's stimulus strategy. The shadow Treasurer has a habit, unfortunately, of saying whatever pops into his head irrespective of substance, rigour and any kind of content. - That is right. There are two people who are very glad you are going, Peter, and they are both on that side. In the same interview with Laurie Oakes eight days ago, the member for North Sydney accused the government of 'spending record levels on advertising'. I thought I had entered a parallel universe on that Sunday morning. It was early in the morning and I was a bit concerned about my state of mind. I thought I had better check the facts. The facts are these: in calendar 2007 total spending on government campaign advertising, $254 million; in the 2008 calendar year total spending on government campaign advertising, $87 million - in other words, barely a third of the record level set by the former government of which the shadow Treasurer was a member.In conclusion, I would like to draw the House's attention to the shadow Treasurer's solution to the problem that he believes is there with government spending and borrowing crowding out the private sector. He says, 'The government should spend less money.' Now, there is a slight problem with that. There is something of a problem as those opposite have yet to nominate a single savings proposal in 18 months - not one. They say they would continue with the government's stimulus payments were they in office tomorrow. They continue to block government savings initiatives in the Senate and, of course, they keep dropping out expensive new promises on top of that. So for them, as the opposition, to suggest that the government should be spending less money would be slightly more credible were they to actually act in opposition in the same way as we did and put forward savings proposals, as the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I did in opposition prior to the 2007 election. It is time that the opposition put the shadow Treasurer out of his misery. I used to think it was crook that they had a shadow Treasurer who nicked other people's lines. I have now worked out there is one thing even worse. That is someone who makes up his own.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question, because it proves yet again how little the Liberal Party cares about education in this country. On the specific school that he raises, I will of course investigate the details of this matter, but can I say this: the track record of the Liberal Party in raising accurate claims in this House is a very poor one indeed. Given that we have already had questions from the Liberal opposition which, when investigated, turned out to be completely incorrect, I will not accept any fact asserted by the shadow minister without having it thoroughly checked. So we will undertake those checks.The shadow minister might think it is smart, as a representative of the Liberal Party, to go around the country insulting school communities on the work that is happening in their schools. The Leader of the Opposition might think it is smart to vote against $14.7 billion going into local schools and all of the support for local jobs that that provides. But, if they ever got out of their Liberal Party bubble and went to a school and spoke to some real human beings about what is happening in their school, they would find a sense of delight about the possibilities for better quality education that this program brings. I personally have visited schools. I have addressed principals forums where we have talked through Building the Education Revolution and where principals, teachers, parents and, indeed, students themselves have been delighted about the possibility that it brings to their school and the support that it brings to their local community.Here we are in the parliament and what we hear constantly from the opposition is carping, moaning and criticism, just like we are hearing now. What we never hear from the shadow minister for education is an education policy - not once, not ever. - In conclusion, the government will get on with delivering its education revolution. I wait for policy statements from the shadow minister. When he makes those policy statements, I think that they should include answers to the following: if the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop Building the Education Revolution? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop the national curriculum process? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop the extra money that we provided for primary schools recurrent for government schools? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop our national partnerships for disadvantaged schools? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop our half-billion-dollar investment in literacy and numeracy? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop our $550 million investment in teacher quality? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop our investment in universal preschools? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop the delivery of more than 700,000 more productivity places? If the Liberal Party were elected at the next election, would they stop the Bradley reforms? I await the answers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. More than $21 billion of the $35 billion we have set aside for transport infrastructure will be spent in regional and rural Australia. The member for Page will certainly be pleased - I am not quite so sure about the member for Cowper - that I have announced today that detailed engineering work will start this week on the $618 million Kempsey bypass. That will enable construction work to commence at the beginning of next year, creating some 450 direct jobs, as well as many indirect jobs, in Kempsey on the North Coast of New South Wales. I am asked about how the investment in regional Australia is being received. Certainly, a number of National Party representatives have had a say about this project - which they could not get around to doing in 12 long years - that it is long overdue. This is a direct piece of self-criticism from the National Party representatives, including the member for Cowper.Regional representatives have also had a bit to say. The Vice-President of the National Farmers Federation has said:Transport infrastructure investment, including road and port funding, is welcomed.He said that in a statement that the NFF put out supporting this government's record funding in regional Australia. I am asked about other representatives and what they had to say about our budget proposals and the record investment which is supporting jobs today and building the infrastructure that Australia needs for tomorrow.I note that the Leader of the National Party was speaking at a New South Wales Nationals conference in Wagga Wagga last Friday. He is also the shadow minister for transport and I thought he might have a bit to say at that conference. Members will recall the amendment moved to the Nation Building Program legislation, when the parliament sat a couple of weeks ago, that would stop funding of black spots in regional communities. Remember that amendment which the opposition moved so that you could not have black spot funding on the national network? They all went to the photo opportunities in their electorates applauding the funding, yet they had voted against it being permitted under the Nation Building Program. I thought the Leader of the National Party might have a bit to say about how the opposition are taking on the government over this outrageous measure that they say the government has put in. I had a look at the speech and there are 2,600 words in it but transport is not mentioned, not even once. There is not one word from the shadow minister about transport. There is nothing about nation building or about infrastructure. He had nothing at all to say.The Leader of the National Party was in Wagga Wagga at the conference and he would have known - and there would have been people from Wagga Wagga there, too, who would have known - that we are duplicating the Hume Highway by 2012, and that we are bringing forward record spending on the Hume Highway. I had a look at what was in the speech of the Leader of the National Party and he said a very interesting thing. He said:We are increasingly seen as the party of regional Australia, grounded in the regions and taking forward regional expertise and ideas for consideration in Canberra and Macquarie Street.That is an interesting perspective given that, when I was elected here in 1996 there were 18 Nationals in the parliament and now there are nine. Yet they argue that they are moving forward and are increasingly seen as the party of regional Australia. - I notice the member for Lyne having a good chuckle at the idea that the National Party are the party of regional Australia and that they are moving forward in Macquarie Street and in Canberra. The Leader of the National Party has become the Comical Ali of the Parliament. Remember Comical Ali as the US troops came into Baghdad? He said, 'It's okay, nothing's happening. It's okay, we're going well.' Comical Ali had this to say about the Americans, 'We have destroyed their shovels. We have driven them back.' Well, those opposite want to destroy the shovels of the government, those nation-building shovels that are being utilised throughout the country to build roads, to build rail and to build ports. Those opposite, in spite of their best efforts to stop the nation-building agenda of this government, will not succeed.I must say that the Leader of the National Party perhaps listened to the leader of the coalition who said, on 20 May when he was in Adelaide, about the government's nation-building agenda and I quote:_ everything will have to be reviewed. There's no question about that.What we see is those opposite drawing into question the nation-building agenda that the government has. The government will not be deterred. It will continue to support programs which support jobs today and which build the infrastructure that Australia needs for tomorrow.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and once again, because we do not have accurate questions from the shadow minister for education, I will check what he has asserted, because we know from former question times that assertions made by the opposition about Building the Education Revolution and about the government's education policies generally turn out to be completely spurious when investigated.What I can say to the shadow minister - and he may or may not be interested because the degree of seriousness with which he takes his education work is always something to be doubted - is that the government is absolutely determined that the Building the Education Revolution program is an addition to investment that would have happened in any event as a result of state budgets. We work constantly with our state and territory colleagues to deliver that program. The sanctions that can be applied under the agreements that surround the Building the Education Revolution program are serious ones and they are understood by our state and territory colleagues.Can I reiterate: for a man who earlier in question time was yelling at me, 'What about Gepps Cross school?' only to be humiliated when his claim was found to be ridiculous -  - I certainly will investigate the claims made. But, given the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has risen to her feet to once again indicate an interest in education, I will take the opportunity to remind the House that, when she was minister for education, we did have a problem with funding going to schools that were closing. I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the Investing in Our Schools Program grant she made to the Bowral Rudolf Steiner School in 2007, when it closed in 2007. There is the grant that she made to the Marist College Rosalie School in 2008, when it closed in 2008. - As I understand the question before us, questions are being raised about the government's education programs. The simple point I was making is that some of these criticisms lie ill in the mouths of people whose administration -  - Can I reiterate that, obviously, Building the Education Revolution is an economic stimulus package. It is to go on top of other expenditures. I will investigate the claims made, but I make this very simple point: for an opposition that opposed this program lock, stock and barrel, under whose administration not one school would get one cent, it seems to me pretty interesting that they come in here day after day with claims that, when investigated, turn out to be fabricated. On the track record of the opposition when it was in government and the track record of those who held the education portfolio, let us just contemplate for a moment what, if any, lasting reforms people will be talking about from the Howard era. Can't think of one? Well, there would be a good reason for that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. The fact is that there is more government support for the solar industry and there are more solar panels going onto Australian rooftops under the Rudd government than at any previous time. The pre-election commitment of $150 million for five years was to fund 15,000 solar rebates; we now have funded more than 80,000 solar rebates from the time we came to government. That exceeds our election commitment some fourfold. Over 60,000 installations are in the pipeline and that means that the industry has at least 12 months work, according to current rates, to continue putting solar panels on people's roofs.During the coalition's entire 12 years in office, the solar rebate program supported around 10,500 installations of solar panels. That is 10,000 panels over 12 years versus 80,000 in just 18 months. I am reminded of that song What a Difference a Day Makes. Some of you will know the melody. -  - I will not sing it here, although I know you would like me to. What a difference a day makes not only for the Leader of the Opposition, given the announcement by the member for Higgins; what a difference 18 months makes in the term of a government. Now, with solar credits operating through the renewable energy target, there is long-term certainty for the solar industry to go and to grow and to invest beyond budget cycles. There will be an up-front capital cost subsidy to all households and no means test. Households, the local fish and chip shop, farmers, community groups, businesses and families are all in the market for solar credits. The member for Flinders, who I notice is absent today, said last week in relation to the Leader of the Opposition:Malcolm Turnbull was the guy who introduced the $8,000 rebate. He knew it was going to be successful. He wanted it to be successful and that is why he actually introduced it as an uncapped rebate.He said, 'Look, if this is successful, that's a good problem we'll have to deal with not a bad problem.'I want to advise the House of the real story. When the now Leader of the Opposition did increase solar rebates in 2007, he said that he expected the program to be unpopular. I refer to the Daily Telegraph of 12 May 2007, which reported:Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull doesn't need a state-wide survey showing him solar energy is unpopular. He already knows. The Saturday Daily Telegraph can reveal the reason the federal government didn't make its $150 million solar rebate any bigger was because there was not enough demand for solar panels. 'If demand exceeds our expectations then obviously we'll review the scheme,' he said. 'To date shortage of money has not been an issue. Solar panels are still pretty expensive.'So we have the member for Flinders saying that the opposition wrote a blank cheque for solar rebates because Mr Turnbull knew it was going to be successful. But, in 2007, the now Leader of the Opposition was backgrounding the Daily Telegraph and saying that his expectations would be that the rebate would be unpopular. This is an absolute sham. But we should not be surprised by the opposition.I was asked how this compares with previous approaches to deliver value - on environmental values, on programs, on water programs and the like. At the same time as very few solar panels were going onto the roofs of Australian homes under the coalition government when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for the environment, he had responsibility for water policy as well. What was that water policy? It was water policy dreamt up on the back of an envelope: a commitment to spend money, not a single delivery of water back into the Murray-Darling Basin system, with no consultation with Treasury, no consultation with the now-departing member for Higgins, no consultation with farmers organisations - in other words, just doing it on the run.It should not surprise us because, well before the last election, we know that the Leader of the Opposition was focusing on another aspect of water policy. This was the advice that the Leader of the Opposition received from his department to spend some $2 million on investigating cloud-seeding technologies. There we were two days into the election campaign, with the substantial matters of policy to be determined, including what the government was then going to bring to the people by way of climate change policy and the like, and we had the member for Wentworth writing to the Prime Minister, saying, 'Can we have $10 million to spend on the project?'I should point out that a year earlier the member for Wentworth, the now Leader of the Opposition, had written to a scientific expert telling him that cloud seeding simply did not work. He used the expression that the results were 'inconclusive at best'. Here we had a reckless spending exercise, against the advice of the minister's department, whilst at the same time there were no policies for renewable energy, no policies for green jobs and no policies for increasing the capacity of the solar industry to do what it had to do. Now we have the opposition leader supporting, it is said, the government's targets on climate change, but with coalition members in his own party saying right out loud that they oppose the scheme.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: the confusion that is rampant within your ranks over climate change is an absolute disgrace - with business needing certainty, with green jobs ready to be put into place - and at this point in time we have an opposition leader who is opposed to the stimulus package and who opposed the energy efficient homes plan. This is a plan which will see an extraordinary number of homes - some three million Australian households - get ceiling insulation in their roofs, reducing the costs of energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and producing jobs and green jobs at the same time. It is time that the opposition leader focused on the real policy initiatives, recognised the importance of providing certainty for the Australian public in dealing with climate change and looked at these significant issues and at the commitment that this government has to solar panels.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, which I am very happy to answer. I suggest that perhaps he needs to have a discussion with his shadow minister, because what his shadow minister said in the last question is that he is concerned that state governments are not maintaining effort on education capital and equipment, whereas the member has raised a question with me which would seem to suggest the only source of funding available to schools for things like air conditioning is Building the Education Revolution. Building the Education Revolution is for specific purposes. Amongst the specific purposes is the construction of new buildings and those buildings can be air conditioned. Of course, on general repairs for schools and the air conditioning of classrooms, that is something that state governments attend to for state schools. So he may want to raise his question with the state Liberal government - The member for Sturt then left the chamber. - What the guidelines provide - and the guidelines are very clear - is for newly constructed buildings under Primary Schools for the 21st Century as part of Building the Education Revolution. Of course, appropriate climate control, whether it be air conditioning or heating, can be installed. National School Pride program money can go to small-scale repairs and it is going to shadecloth and some of the other important things in schools. It is not going to air conditioning; that is true. As the member would be aware, a substantial consideration with the insertion of air conditioning in schools is the ongoing costs of running the air conditioning. He would know, from the climate he comes from, that the capital cost of putting in the air conditioning is one thing; the year-on-year power cost is another. We have obviously said to state governments, as we have gone about this task, that our economic stimulus is extra to the things that they ordinarily do. One of the things that they ordinarily do is work out how to renovate classrooms for climate control, including an understanding of what the ongoing recurrent costs of that would be. We have said to state governments that, with major constructs under Primary Schools for the 21st Century, appropriate climate control will be part of the fit-out, as will the things required to make buildings functional, including in some cases interactive whiteboards and the like. Those things are all part of the program.I can understand that the member is disgruntled about the circumstances in his electorate for some of the children who attend school in his electorate. On the question of air conditioning for current school facilities, he should feel very free to direct that to the state minister for education in his state of Western Australia.</DOC>

 - Thank you to the member for Melbourne Ports. As a former constituent of his, I can attest to the fact that he has a serious interest in the issue of climate change. We all have a responsibility - including the opposition - to the Australian people and to future generations to act on climate change. For the government's part, the government accepts the consensus view of scientists. Importantly, the Fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that warming is unequivocal and human activities are responsible for most of the observed warming over the last 50 years. That is a consequence of the work of over 1,200 scientists from over 130 countries that has been subject to peer review, contained and represented in the Fourth assessment report of the IPCC. The government also accepts that if we fail to act now we will cause irreparable damage to our environment, economy and way of life. The fact is that Australia is a hot and dry continent and failure to act will have an adverse effect on our ecosystems and our economy, particularly on industries such as agriculture and tourism.Further delay in acting against climate change means the cost of adjustment will be greater and other countries will get ahead of us in creating the low-pollution jobs of the future. And that is why the government has established targets and developed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to go about achieving them. But in the face of all this evidence the coalition continue to ignore the challenge of climate change and insist on delay - even after 12 years in government characterised by inaction on this issue in the face of numerous reports and commitments given during their period in government.Just to give an overview of some of the work and the advice that the coalition commissioned and ignored: in 1999 there were no fewer than six reports to the Howard government, all of which were ignored. The Australian Greenhouse Office discussion paper series on emissions trading was issued during that year and included a discussion paper on establishing the boundaries of a scheme, a discussion paper on issuing permits, a discussion paper on how crediting carbon pollution could occur, a discussion paper on designing the carbon-trading market, a discussion paper on the greenhouse challenge and a further report of the Greenhouse Energy Group on planning for mandatory targets for the uptake of renewable energy in power supplies, followed in the year 2000 by a further report of the Australian Greenhouse Office on encouraging early greenhouse abatement mechanisms.In 2002 there was a further report from the Greenhouse Office on greenhouse gas emissions. In 2003 there was a report on renewable opportunities and a review of the operation of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act. In 2007, of course, there was the Shergold report, from the Prime Minister's task group at that time, on emissions trading, which led to the Howard government indicating that it would commit to an emissions trading scheme. But in the face of all that, nothing was done. The advice was ignored. The reports were shelved.During 2008, by contrast, the Rudd government received the Garnaut Climate Change Review report. A green paper on the development of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was developed. A white paper was issued in December 2008 and there were numerous industry consultations. In 2009, the draft CPRS legislation was released, numerous Senate inquiries have been held and now the draft Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill has been released. On that point, the government intends implementing its policy by virtue of that legislation to achieve 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply being delivered by renewable sources by the year 2020. That is expected to drive $19 billion worth of investment in renewable energy activity.These are great institutional changes. They are extremely important and in the face of them the coalition has abrogated its responsibility to support them. However, Mr Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, has indicated what is the coalition's policy. He made this remark on 9 July 2008:_ the Howard Government's policy last year was that we would establish an emissions trading system not later than 2012.And importantly, in the light of the excuses for delay that have been articulated by the Liberal Party in recent times, Mr Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, said:It was not conditional on international action _Commitment to an emissions trading system was to be pursued by the coalition. More recently, the Leader of the Opposition has confirmed that there will be an emissions trading scheme in this country. The trouble is that the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition cannot deliver on these issues and all we have heard are excuses for delay. The reason that there are excuses for delay is that the opposition is deeply divided. And you do not have to take my point of view on it; there is plenty of evidence from members of the opposition. Take this quote from Senator Eric Abetz:There is no doubt that weeds - That was 'weeds' - pose _ a challenge much clearer, more present and possibly more serious than the unclear challenge which climate change may or may not pose to our biodiversity _And there are many other instances where members of the opposition have indicated a completely contrary view to that of the Leader of the Opposition on the issue of emissions trading and scepticism about the science. And that is the reason for the division on that side of politics and the reason that all they posit are excuses for delay. The government has brought forward the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It has passed through this House. We will be bringing forward legislation to establish a fourfold increase in the renewable energy target. We have established ambitious carbon pollution reduction targets, we have signed the Kyoto Protocol and we will take action. It is time that the opposition exercised responsibility on behalf of the Australian community on this question.The member for O'Connor then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I do not know where the Lone Ranger and Tonto are today, but I can assure the House they long gave up trying to corral the member for Kennedy. More seriously, this question is a very serious question. It goes to the potential development of the North West Mineral Province in Queensland. This province has long been held back by the lack of an adequate supply of energy at a reasonable cost. The member for Kennedy has raised the question of the possible development of the North West Mineral Province in the context of a key part of the government's recent budget strategy going to the establishment of a real government commitment to clean energy in Australia. I welcome his support for that government initiative, because it goes to our requirement to invest in not only carbon capture and storage but also renewable energy in Australia. That is because we are not interested in trying to pick winners; we are about trying to create a framework that encourages investment in all sources of potential energy in Australia.That takes me, firstly, to the question of carbon capture and storage and a commitment of $2.4 billion to cleaning up coal in Australia, reducing emissions. CCS is vital to our future, because 82 per cent of Australia's electricity comes from coal-fired power stations. I was pleased to see carbon capture and storage in a commercial operation, the Sleipner petroleum field, when I recently visited Norway. CCS is currently in place throughout the world and it is our responsibility, not only as a coal-dependent energy nation but also as a major coal exporter, to actually get this technology right. I would also say that, if we achieve later this year the Gorgon gas investment of $30 billion to $50 billion, something that the Prime Minister and I are working on at the moment, you will see the largest carbon capture and storage operation in the world here, on Barrow Island in Western Australia.The member has also raised the need to focus on renewables. We are about investing real money - the biggest investment by an Australian government - in the renewables sector in Australia. That builds on our determination to put in place a measured carbon pollution reduction scheme with a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. Our demonstration program of $1.6 billion in solar technologies is not just about solar PV; it is also about seriously investigating whether or not solar thermal could supply real, baseload, secure energy in Australia - important not only to Australia but also to the global community.Not content with just focusing on carbon capture and storage and solar, we are also going to encourage the exploration and development of other demonstration activities, such as geothermal and wave power. This is about us ensuring as a nation that, when it comes to the issue of energy security, as we move to a low-emission economy, we not only guarantee our own future but also put in place technology options of great interest and need to the global community at large.So I say to the member for Kennedy: I express my appreciation for your support of the government's clean energy strategy. I am not the Lone Ranger; I have a huge posse behind me and absolute support of our clean energy demonstration program. Perhaps more importantly, he, like me, understands and appreciates that without a commitment to clean energy we will never have a capacity to develop the North West Mineral Province, which has the potential to be as important as north-west Western Australia. I thank him for his question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. Obviously amongst Victorian members there is a particular interest, but it is a matter of importance for the whole country. Members of the House may be aware that last Friday the World Health Organisation declared the H1N1 influenza strain a pandemic, the first global pandemic for 40 years. The World Health Organisation's phase 6 is characterised by community level outbreaks in at least one country in a different World Health Organisation region from the source country - in this case, Mexico. It indicates that there is sustained human-to-human community level transmission.The WHO's decision to declare the first pandemic of the 21st century indicates that it is no longer possible to contain the virus in a particular geographical area. There are now nearly 30,000 cases of human swine influenza around the world, with 74 countries affected. The World Health Organisation considers that this pandemic, at least in its early stages, will be of moderate severity. Around the world, and as we are seeing here in Australia, the overwhelming majority of patients experience mild symptoms and will make a rapid and full recovery. This of course is an important factor to be weighed in the public health advice that is being provided to the community.However, as we also know, the disease has a hard edge with potentially severe complications for people with underlying health conditions such as morbid obesity, respiratory conditions and chronic disease and, like the regular flu, for pregnant women. Increasingly the world's focus, like our focus, is moving to identifying and treating those most at risk of severe complications. I do need to report to the House that we have heard the first reports in the media, as yet unconfirmed, of the first death in the United Kingdom, which would be the first death outside the Americas, underscoring the point that this disease can have severe consequences, although it is expected to be mild to moderate in most.Australia has about six per cent of the world's confirmed cases. Here in Australia as at 12 noon today there were 1,762 confirmed cases - 1,210 in Victoria, 191 in New South Wales, 116 in Queensland, 63 in South Australia, 66 in Western Australia, 32 in Tasmania, 53 in the ACT and 31 in the Northern Territory. There are 10 people currently in hospital, three of whom are in intensive care. The hospitalised have generally been those people with existing conditions or complications such as morbid obesity and respiratory conditions. A number of schools and childcare centres are closed around the country, particularly in those states other than Victoria that are still in the 'contain' phase.Australia's current approach to swine flu is consistent with the World Health Organisation's recommendation that countries should now focus on treating those who are ill, providing guidance to people to protect themselves, closely monitoring the disease and adjusting the response to local conditions. This is what is already occurring in Australia and underpins the government's public health advice to the community. In particular, this is consistent with what is occurring in Victoria, with that state on a modified 'sustain' alert level. I need to advise the House that we continue to give ongoing consideration to the appropriateness of Australia's national alert level. The rest of the country remains at 'contain', where efforts are continuing with a focus on slowing the spread of the disease, which is why we are still seeing school closures in states other than Victoria. Of course, this is something that will continue to be reviewed day by day and hour by hour on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer as well as the Australian Health Protection Committee and the National Pandemic Emergency Committee.I do need to flag that, as the number of cases in Australia steadily increases, the government, in conjunction with the states and territories, will give further consideration to moving to a consistent alert level across Australia and to modifying our response to take account of the increasing number of cases in our community and the moderate severity to date. In particular, we will continue to carefully monitor the extent of community transmission - that is, cases with no known contact with other confirmed cases. From the data over the weekend the majority of cases outside Victoria can still be traced back to known contacts with other confirmed cases. But this is changing, and we will continue to monitor it closely over the coming days.I take this opportunity to remind Australians that the World Health Organisation and the government do not recommend the closure of any borders or travel restrictions during the pandemic. But the community must be aware that Australians travelling abroad are required to adhere not only to the laws of other countries but also to their health and quarantine arrangements. The Smartraveller website provides advice to this effect for those who are considering travel overseas.Although Australians are being encouraged to continue to undertake normal day-to-day activities, I know this is going to be difficult for some people, particularly as the consequences of voluntary exclusion from school and school closures have an impact on family life. These school measures are being maintained in states in the 'contain' phase as an agreed, effective way to slow the spread of the disease in the community.I want to take the opportunity to again thank the public, and parents in particular, for their forbearance in this difficult period, which we know can cause family inconvenience. I would also like to take the opportunity to again thank doctors and other health officials for their ongoing efforts and attention in a pandemic which is going to continue to add a significant burden to their already demanding roles.</DOC>

 - I am happy to look at the details, as usual. Whether what the member says is true or not, I do not know, but I am happy to -  - Well, that would be a change, wouldn't it! That would be a dramatic change from what we have been seeing in the House over a long period of time. This crew opposite will go to enormous lengths to try and discredit the importance of economic stimulus and what it has done to support employment and business in the Australian economy. They will go to any lengths - they will say anything, they will do anything and they will distort anything - to try and cast some doubt on the effectiveness of economic stimulus, which has been of such benefit to so many people in this community who have been employed and so many businesses out there who really need customers coming through the door. But they simply do not get it. I am happy to follow up the details, but it does not in any way absolve any of those opposite from their irresponsibility in voting against what has been absolutely critical for the Australian economy in our time of need.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I would of course be delighted to update the House on the exciting developments with the official launch of the World Cup bid yesterday. Before doing that I would like to take the opportunity to place on the parliamentary record the Australian government's congratulations to Football Federation Australia, to Pim Verbeek, to captain Lucas Neill and of course to the phenomenal Socceroos on their recent historic qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. I know that the whole parliament will join in adding their congratulations. This achievement should not be underestimated. It is after all only the third time that Australia has qualified to compete with the best of the best on the world stage in this sport. But it is also the first time that we have been able to go back-to-back, and the manner in which we did it was without conceding a single goal and we qualified with two games remaining, all of which make it a truly remarkable achievement.The Socceroos have shown that Australia has become a major player on the world stage when it comes to football. This was also demonstrated yesterday with the official launch of our FIFA World Cup bid. I know that the official launch of our bid was attended by members from both sides of the House and quite literally brought football into the parliament. When the bid was launched by the Prime Minister yesterday, the message that Australia sent to the world was clear: Australia is ready and we want the world to come and play on our home turf. I would like to particularly note the contribution that the Leader of the Opposition made yesterday when he stated that the bid had 'the unequivocal support' of both sides of the House and that the opposition and the government will be 'side by side, joined at the hip, as dual strikers' to bring the World Cup to Australia. I think it is important that we note that, on these major international ventures, this parliament does work together very productively because we know that bipartisanship is crucial to the success of the prized goal.We also know that, beyond politics, the involvement and the inclusion of the community is crucial. We need to show the whole world that as a community we are united behind this bid, and the community will be included with a strong role to play in the battle going forward. Chairman Frank Lowy announced yesterday that we want the community to play their role as thousands of individual ambassadors. Already, one Facebook site that is dedicated to supporting Australia's bid to host the 2018-22 World Cup now has over 80,000 people registered as members. In fact, just prior to question time I received an email from the Subiaco Junior Soccer Club under-15s, who were offering to be -  - I am sure they are a wonderful team. In fact they are travelling overseas to compete in Sweden later this year. They have offered to act as ambassadors for Australia's bid on the world stage. This is an offer that we will certainly take them up on. I would like to call on all Australians to get involved and log onto the newly launched website, www.australia2018-2022.com.au, to register their support for our bid and to get behind the campaign to show to the entire world that there is no better place on the planet to hold the World Cup than right here in Australia, because there is no doubt that there is a lot of hard work that lies before us from this point on.We also know that there are significant benefits in terms of infrastructure and job creation and of course massive benefits in terms of tourism potential. So we as a government will continue to work very hard to support Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley and Football Federation Australia. We will work on a coordinated approach across government but we will also be working in very strong partnership with all of the states and territories, which have signed up to supporting the bid through COAG. Australia will be making its first presentation before FIFA later this year, in December, before submitting the formal bid in May of next year, with a decision being made in December next year.We know that the competition is very tight but we also know that when it comes to hosting major sporting events there is nobody in the world that does it better than Australia. Together we will work on a united and inclusive bid to show to the whole world that Australia will put on the best World Cup the world has ever seen.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. What I would say in response to his question is that Australia's net debt is lower than that of all the other major advanced economies. I would also say to the honourable member that on the question of net debt he has a responsibility to say to the parliament, to name, a figure that would be acceptable to him, because each time they are challenged with this opposite they go missing in action. Let us have some honesty in this debate. Those opposite know that they have embraced exactly the same debt and deficit strategy as the government, though seeking to pretend otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question and for his advocacy on behalf of the 2,600 carers in Dawson. Right around the country, carers, including those in Dawson, are about to receive some additional financial support. From tomorrow around half a million carers will get a new permanent $600 carer supplement, and most of these payments will be made by 26 June. The payment will go to people who are receiving the carer payment, the veterans carer service pension and also those receiving the carer allowance. They will receive $600 for each of the people they care for. Those people who are receiving both the carer payment and the carer allowance can receive two supplement payments. This means that many will receive $1,200 supplements.Centrelink will make the payments directly into people's bank accounts. What this does, as I think every single member of this House recognises, is provide important support to those carers who are doing such a fantastic job caring for those people they love. Each of us knows that that does put significant financial pressure on these people and their families. This new carer supplement will provide carers with additional financial security, and it is now a legislated annual supplement - a supplement that carers are going to be able to count on into the future. From 2010 the carer supplement will be paid each July and it will no longer be the case that carers have to hang on government decisions year on year, as they used to in the past.This new $600 supplement is part of the government's secure and sustainable pension reform package and, of course, has been widely welcomed by carers around the country. I would just like to share with members of the House, and particularly with the member for Dawson, some remarks made by a carer in his electorate, Pat Norman, from Mackay, who looks after her husband, Ash. Pat is a carer on carer payment and Ash is on the disability support pension. Pat told my office:We have been waiting for this for so long and these reforms have finally given us the peace of mind and extra support we need. What the government has done by making this a permanent payment is put my mind at ease for the rest of our lives.From 20 September, Pat and Ash will also benefit from increases to their carer payment and the disability support pension.We know on this side of the House that these reforms have required very difficult decisions to be made - decisions to make the pension system sustainable for the long term; decisions that the opposition now say that they support but of course did not have the bottle to do in the 12 years they were in government. By contrast, from tomorrow the $600 payment will be made to carers to give them the security that they so deserve.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. It is pure baloney for the shadow Treasurer to assert that levels of borrowing that the government has not even engaged in are somehow having an impact on the 10-year bond rate. It is pure baloney, and that is what all of the economic commentators have said. It just demonstrates how opportunistic and how desperate this opposition has become, because their alibi has now left the room. The member for Higgins is leaving and now the weight is on them to come up with an alternative economic policy which demonstrates what they would do in an environment where government revenues have been hit by $210 billion over the forward estimates.The member knows very well that we are dealing with long-term bond rates. They are affected predominantly by what is going on in international financial markets, and borrowings in this country are a tiny percentage of that. The long-term bond rate is also affected by what the Reserve Bank does with short-term rates. Those are the two factors, and that just demonstrates how out of depth this shadow Treasurer is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Australians can be confident about their long-term economic future, because we are weathering this global economic storm better than most other economies. Firstly, the economy is the fastest growing among the major advanced economies. Secondly, we have the second-lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies. We have the lowest debt of the major advanced economies and also, unlike the other major advanced economies, this economy is not in recession.Part of the reason for that is that the government has been on the front foot implementing our nation building for recovery plan. The nation building for recovery plan is being driven in each and every corner of the Commonwealth, resulting in some 35,000 construction projects across the country. The alternative, of course, recommended by some of those opposite, is to sit on our hands and do nothing. This is not the recommendation of the government nor is it its plan of action.The depth of the global economic challenge we are facing was underlined by more data which came in from Europe overnight. The European economies lost a record 1.22 million jobs in the first quarter. Employment in the 16-member euro region fell 0.8 per cent from the fourth quarter, the largest decline since 1995, and the European Commission is now forecasting that unemployment across the euro region will average 9.9 per cent this year and 11.5 per cent in 2010.The IMF managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also said that there are 'some green shoots' out there - and we should emphasise the point - and that the IMF has revised upwards its forecast for 2010 but 'we have to be very cautious and a lot has to be done to be as sure as possible that the recovery will take place in the first half of 2010'. That is what the IMF had to say. US Treasury Secretary Geithner echoed a similar tone of caution in his remarks when he said:Recovery will be slower than we would normally see. This is still going to be an exceptionally challenging period for business and for consumers.That underlines the depths and the dimensions of the global economic challenge the government faces.Let us also place this challenge in some historical context. The global economy is forecast to contract by 1.3 per cent in 2009, the first time that there will be a contraction in the global economy since the IMF began keeping records just after the war. Let us put that firmly in mind. Let us also compare it to the two previous recessions we have had in recent times, the global outlook both for the 1990s and for the recession of the 1980s as well. In the 1990s growth fell to positive 1.5 per cent in 1991 at the depths of that particular recession, and growth fell in the 1980s recession to 0.9 per cent in 1982.The reason I emphasise these figures is to underline the fact that against the measure of the two previous recessions of the eighties and nineties, with which most people are familiar in this country, we are facing a much more difficult set of economic circumstances with global growth being projected to contract for the first time since the IMF began keeping its records just after the war. For us, of the economies on which we depend, our trading partners, eight of our top 10 trading partners are already in recession and China, of course, has halved its growth from two years ago. Across the world only three of the 33 advanced economies have recorded positive growth.The nation building for recovery plan that the government is implementing has also been complemented by aggressive actions by the Reserve Bank on interest rates. Since the government has been in office, Australian families have benefited from six interest rate cuts. There has been, at the official rate, a cut of 425 basis points and interest rates are now at their lowest point in nearly 14 years. Under the Liberals Australian families suffered 10 interest rate rises in a row, a rise of some 250 basis points. -  - I always note that they object when presented with these facts, but they are very simple facts: there were 10 interest rate rises in a row under the previous government, adding up to 250 basis points, and since this government has been in office there have been six interest rate cuts in a row, 425 basis points.What does that mean for a working family? If you are out there with a mortgage of $300,000, back at the end of 2007 an interest rate would have been paid of 8.55 per cent. Now we have in fact a standard variable mortgage rate of 5.78 per cent. That means that if you are on a standard mortgage of some $300,000 that represents a saving around $530 a month. Those opposite seemed to regard that as a laughing matter. Go to the small-business constituency and interest rates as they applied at the end of 2007. For small business, rates for loans were 9.6 per cent. They are currently running at 7.9 per cent. - Again, what the government is doing is harnessing fiscal policy with monetary policy and seeking to make a difference when it comes to the impact of the global economic recession. We are engaged in a positive strategy to build the economy up, to lift Australia out of the global recession as soon as we can. This is in contrast to those opposite who always embark upon a strategy to talk the economy down - a negative strategy; always negatively criticising any positive economic news which may emerge. Our approach is to prosecute this strategy for the future. It is the right approach.I draw the attention of those opposite to the release of RBA board minutes this morning because they have raised questions of public finance and public debt. Let me read them to you. The minutes flag concerns around public finances globally, noting:Containing the build-up of public debt over the years ahead was likely to be a significant challenge for some countries _These points -  - The member for North Sydney obviously has not read the released minutes of the Reserve Bank. Let me just continue reading from the minutes, for the benefit of the member for North Sydney. Let me just read this through to you. These points have been made previously by the Governor of the Reserve Bank; he has made clear that his comments were not in reference to Australia. He goes on to say:Having said that, the size of the build-up in government debt in some of the major economies will surely become much more of a constraint on their fiscal room for manoeuvre over the next decade. - Let me add a sentence for the honourable member who objects so volubly. The governor said:Let me make it clear that I am not talking about Australia here; rather, I have in mind countries where public debt could approach 100 per cent of annual GDP _Can I just suggest to those opposite that it is time they embarked on a positive strategy to build the Australian economy up rather than the continued negative campaign to talk the economy down.</DOC>

 - I draw the honourable member's attention to the answer I gave in the House yesterday concerning the global bond rate - the bond rate which arises from the amount of public bonds on issue around the world, which from memory is around $83 trillion, of which Australian bond issue as a fraction equals 0.001. That is fact 1. Fact 2 is that the assumption underpinning the honourable member's question concerns interest rates in Australia. Let them absorb this basic fact: interest rates in Australia are now at a 40-year low. We have had six interest rate cuts in a row; we had 10 interest rate rises in a row under those opposite. Can I suggest that those opposite focus on the facts rather than simply again trying to talk the economy down with a rolling negative campaign to undermine business and consumer sentiment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. There are something like 299 projects underway in Solomon as a result of the government's nation building for recovery plan. This includes something like 185 defence housing units and 92 school projects in Darwin and surrounding areas. The member for Solomon has been a very strong advocate for every one of those projects, unlike those opposite, who are just so negative all of the time. They are of course opposed to every single one of them. The member for Solomon will at least stand up for jobs in his community. He will put his hand up for jobs in his community, unlike those opposite.There has been some evidence over the past week that does show that the economic stimulus has been working to support jobs in our community. Last week we saw that house finance rose 3.6 per cent in April and is now 13.4 per cent higher over the year. Housing finance to owner-occupiers rose for the seventh month in a row in April, having fallen in each of the eight months prior to the announcement of the government's first home owners boost. Loans to first home buyers are at record levels, representing 28 per cent of new loans which are financed. This has caused Mr Chris Lamont from the Housing Industry Association to remark: 'Were it not for the first home owners boost a lot more people in the building industry would be out of work.' That is certainly so true.Of course, last week we had the consumer confidence figures, where the country recorded the largest increase in 22 years - at its highest level since January 2008. Consumer confidence is now more than 20 per cent above the levels of last October. As Bill Evans observed last week:_ this surge in the Index can be seen as a delayed response to the significant stimulus over the last nine months.Business confidence rose sharply in May, causing Alan Oster from the National Australia Bank to say this:The improvement in confidence has developed more momentum - no doubt helped locally by the budget _He went on to say that 'to date the one-off government payments to low-income families and pensioners in December, the significant easing in financial conditions and the government's tax bonus payments have helped retail, which has performed well above the industry average'.That brings us to the RBA minutes which have been released today. This is what the RBA minutes say:Monetary policy had been eased significantly, and budgetary measures were also providing significant support to demand. Indications were that these policies were having some impact, though the full effects would take time yet to be seen.So there is a positive strategy from the government. There is ample evidence that it is working. There is a rocky road ahead but what we on this side of the House know is that we are doing everything we can to support families, jobs and business.</DOC>

 - The very first point I would make is that the government put in place the bank guarantee last October to ensure that credit was going to flow to the Australian economy, to households and to businesses. If it had not been for that decisive action then we would have experienced in this country a severe contraction of credit and the price of it would have increased dramatically. As a consequence of that action there has been a flow of credit in this economy virtually unlike in any other advanced economy. The point I want to make is that those opposite opposed the bank guarantee. They opposed our term funding guarantee that has enabled our banks to borrow almost $100 billion. - Those opposite must think that everybody in this House has no memory whatsoever. They have been in this House for week after week opposing the term funding guarantee - week after week conducting a campaign against the term funding guarantee - which has enabled our banks to borrow $100 billion offshore to ensure there was a flow of credit to the Australian economy, including to Australian businesses. - Today in the Senate there is a very important piece of legislation which will put in place ABIP and which will ensure, under some circumstances, a flow of finance to business. They are going to vote against it. They have opposed that tooth and nail and they have opposed the term funding guarantee tooth and nail. You could produce a very large box of statements from those that oppose the term funding guarantee. I know everybody in the gallery remembers the opposition coming in here day after day ripping the government apart because we put in place the bank guarantee - which has turned out to be spectacularly successful and one of the most beneficial measures that has been put in place in Australian history to support our financial system. It is also the case that there are difficulties for some sections of business in accessing finance even at the moment - I accept that - but it is not a function of anything other than the fact that the conditions in financial markets globally are very difficult. - There are thousands of small businesses that have a stake in what occurs with the ABIP legislation in the Senate this very day. There are thousands of small businesses that have a very big stake. There are thousands of small businesses that think that the government's economic stimulus measures were absolutely what was needed to support demand and to make sure that small business had customers. This is something that those opposite have opposed all the way through - the essential economic stimulus that we have put in place to ensure that small business has got customers walking through the door.Of course, then there is the campaign from those opposite against OzCar and the efforts of this government to ensure a flow of finance to car dealers. The principal beneficiaries of that will be car dealerships in rural and regional Australia. We have had a whole smear campaign mounted around that. They cannot be too concerned about the flow of credit to car dealerships. They are certainly not concerned about the flow of credit to many of those people in retail small business. We understand there is still a challenging environment out there for many in small business, and that is why we will do everything we possibly can to ensure that those matters are attended to and that credit flows.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lowe for his question. I know that he would be very supportive of the 559 economic stimulus plan projects in his electorate totalling more than $61 million. I know that he is a man who is very much in touch with his local schools and a frequent visitor to them. He would be delighted to see that 42 of his local schools are receiving more than $53 million through Building the Education Revolution - the biggest school modernisation program the country has ever seen.Before I came to question time, the member for Higgins - I note that he is not here now - was giving a press conference where he regretted that there was not enough humour in question time in the modern age. My mind has gone back to a comedy show on television called Not the Nine O'Clock News. What I am hoping is that I might be able to reprise that comedy show on the basis of what is not in the Australian today about Building the Education Revolution. People may have seen reports in the Australian today about Holland Park State School. It is a great school in the electorate of the Prime Minister. In reading that report today in the Australian newspaper people may have come to the conclusion that there was a problem with this program. Let me just clarify it for members of the House. Under Primary Schools for the 21st Century, Holland Park State School has been approved funding of $1½ million for the construction of a new library, which was identified by the school as a priority, and a further $1½ million to extend and refurbish the existing multipurpose hall with new office and kitchen facilities, including seating, staging, sound and light facilities.I understand that there were some critical comments made by a community member about this plan, and they are reported in today's Australian, and of course the Australian will report things said to it. I note that the principal of this school, Mr Anthony Gribbin, has sent the following statement about the school's view of the project. He says, somewhat informally:Dear, KevinThe school community is delighted by its successful application for funding under the second round of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century - Building the Education Revolution.Holland Park State School will receive a once-in-a-lifetime enhancement of its facilities with improved interactive technology for all students and teachers, a new library and refurbished hall. These facilities will help us deliver quality education to all our students, providing them with a secure foundation for the future.The school is currently in the planning stages with Education Queensland and it is expected that the approved projects will be ready for the start of the 2010 school year.These facilities will also benefit the wider community, as they will be accessible for community training programs, meetings or workshops.I thought that was a pretty glowing endorsement.On the question of endorsements, my attention was also drawn today to the words of the former Prime Minister when asked about the member for Higgins. He said only 10 words:I wish Peter well, but I have no further statement. - I must admit that I did not think I would ever live to see the day when a Liberal member of parliament would not want me to quote former Prime Minister John Howard. It is a very unusual turn of events. - I was referring, of course, to his 10 words today about the member for Higgins - that is, one for each two years in parliament and one for each budget that the member for Higgins delivered. Of course, we suspect that is probably more than the former Prime Minister said to the member for Higgins in the last five years. - The question was about Building the Education Revolution; the question was about endorsements. I have obviously talked about the strong endorsement of the projects in the Prime Minister's electorate. The government will continue delivering Building the Education Revolution. I understand that it is opposed every step of the way by members opposite, but we will deliver this program in the interests of jobs today and Australian education tomorrow - which, as you can tell by the interjections, is something the opposition care absolutely nothing about.</DOC>

 - I can answer the member's question very simply: no, we will not be amending the guidelines. We will be awaiting an apology from the Liberal Party for the standover tactics that used to be used in relation to Investing in Our Schools recognition ceremonies -  - Mr Speaker, if it would assist the House, I withdraw. And I freely acknowledge the member for Sturt -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I indicated, I do withdraw - and, of course, it is more squeak than standover when it comes to the member for Sturt.On the question of Building the Education Revolution, I think a very important point has been raised by the member for Sturt - that is, the point about the guidelines. Our guidelines ensure that schools right around the country, all schools, will benefit from Building the Education Revolution. Yesterday evening I was with the member for Sturt in the Main Committee, where the member for Sturt interestingly talked about the 'targeting' of Building the Education Revolution. He said:There are schools that already have very substantial infrastructure, have everything that a school could really want for its pupils -  - My point simply goes to the question of guidelines. I will ask the member for Sturt to clarify at some time, for the House and for the Australian people, exactly which schools he thinks should miss out under Building the Education Revolution. I am very interested that the only education policy of the opposition is that they would seek better targeting of a program they do not support. Their education policy is, apparently, that they would better target nothing! That is what they would do in government. They would engage in better targeting of nothing, because they voted against Building the Education Revolution.On the question raised by the member for Sturt, when he wants to come and apologise for things like Liberal staff members employed by state members of parliament being invited to address Investing in Our Schools recognition ceremonies above local Labor members, then we will be all ears.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and his ongoing interest in the security of this nation. Can I also pay tribute to the outgoing Minister for Home Affairs, the member for Macquarie, Bob Debus. Thank you for your counsel in recent days, Bob; it has been very helpful to me. It is well and truly the case that he has done a great deal of work in this portfolio. He has shown a great interest in border protection and the interests of securing this nation.The government is committed to keeping Australia's borders secure and to working with our partners across the region to stop people-smugglers. The government's approach to unauthorised boat arrivals includes retaining the excision of offshore islands, retaining mandatory detention of all unauthorised boat arrivals, retaining offshore processing on Christmas Island for all unauthorised boat arrivals and removing from Australia those who do not qualify for protection.Before the budget we already had more boats patrolling our northern waters than the previous government and had increased spending on Customs surveillance.  However, the spike in people-smuggling activity worldwide means we need more resources to deal with this global problem -  - We have, in fact. - We know that this is not an issue Australia faces alone. For example, according to UNHCR estimates, 36,000 people arrived by boat on Italian shores in 2008 and 15,300 in Greece and the Greek Islands. This clearly illustrates that it is a global problem and we need both -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. This is a very important issue. I guess I expected this was such an important issue that there would be a bipartisan approach to these matters, but clearly those opposite do not see it as such an important issue.In relation to people-smugglers, we know - and I am hoping those opposite understand - that people-smugglers feed on the vulnerabilities of the millions of people affected by regional and global conflicts like those in Afghanistan, the recent conflict in Sri Lanka and those in Pakistan and in Somalia, to name a few. Those conflicts of course have led to an increase in people-smuggling and an increase in those people seeking refuge. People-smuggling, as we know, is an abhorrent and despicable trade. And the Rudd government will continue to take all necessary and all reasonable steps to end this criminal transnational business.That is why we have provided a $654 million strategy for governments to combat people-smuggling and strengthen Australia's border. We are funding strategies that will support the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, the Australian Federal Police and other government agencies to work with source and transit countries to stop ventures before they can be launched. Customs have provided over $405 million to deter people from attempting the dangerous journey to get to Australia. Customs will also provide the resources to work with governments and intelligence agencies in critical transit countries and to detect and intercept boats on the way to Australia through increased maritime patrol and surveillance.The Australian Federal Police have been provided with a further $41.6 million to enhance the capacity of the people-smuggling strike team and foreign law enforcement agencies. The Australian Federal Police will build the capacity of law enforcement agencies in critical transit countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka by financing local law enforcement operations and by providing training and operational support. The government will also spend $13.6 million over two years to strengthen our legal and prosecution capacity - again, another very important element to the government's strategy. Our border protection and people-smuggling policies are tough and they are strong. This government is determined to stop people-smugglers and to keep the borders of our nation safe.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the shadow minister that, in adding to an answer yesterday, I was hoping to assist him. At that point, of course, he was not in the chamber, as a result of being excluded by you, Mr Speaker. What I can say to the member for Sturt, if he is interested - and maybe because they choose to interject rather than listen, he is not - is that the circumstances at the Hastings Public School in New South Wales are these: in 2003, there was a joint project involving a covered outdoor learning area. My understanding is that there was $40,000 of government funding and a $40,000 co-contribution from the P&amp;C from fundraising they had undertaken themselves - a total of $80,000 for, no doubt, a very worthy project. What has been made available to the school, under Building the Education Revolution, is a significant structure. It is the size of 1½ tennis courts; it has a solid roof; and it will include the fit-out, which will include an amphitheatre, seating, a sound system to facilitate school assemblies and performances, and science and art work spaces. This is obviously a very substantial structure with a fit-out which will enable whole school activities under cover.What seems to me remarkable about these questions is that the shadow minister's only position on education is to come into this parliament day after day and say, 'Why doesn't the government do less on education?' Presumably the shadow minister for education would only be happy if the government was doing nothing on education. Presumably he would be happy then because it would exactly mirror what the Howard government did in office - absolutely nothing. I challenge any member of this House to name one successful, profound school reform that happened under the Howard government. No, it did not. There were lots of articles in the Australian about Maoists on curriculum boards, but not one profound reform that -  - It is always helpful to get a contribution from the future of the Liberal Party, the member for Mackellar. We wait for her to make a re-emergence much closer to the front. It is inevitable over time. My point is simply this: if we look at the track record on education of the Howard government, we are invited day after day to do less by the opposition. Well, we will not be doing less, because we do not want this nation to be at the back of the OECD for investment in early education. We do not want this nation to have slipping education standards. We do not want this nation to have disadvantaged children left behind. We do not want this nation to have children in substandard facilities. We do not want this nation to lack a 21st century vocational education and training system able to meet the needs of the modern economy, particularly during the days of the global recession. We do not want this nation to lack a 21st century university system which is ready for a decade of reform so a greater number of Australians can get the benefit of a university education, particularly Australians from disadvantaged backgrounds.I know every member of the Liberal Party might find those things offensive, but it is what drives us each and every day and we will continue to deliver it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question, as I know climate change and the response to it is such a matter of continuing disunity on the part of those opposite, where the Nationals and the Liberals are yet to reach a common landing point on anything! What the government has done in the 18 months it has been in office is, first of all, ratify Kyoto and bring Australia back to the global negotiating table. Those opposite had taken Australia away from that table for year after year after year.Secondly, we established an ambitious set of carbon pollution reduction targets. To that effect, we have introduced into this House and passed through this House the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, of which the government is proud - doing our bit to bring down greenhouse gas emissions, providing necessary adjustments for industry and for families and also ensuring that we are doing our bit to bring about a better future given the challenge which climate change represents to the Australian economy and to so many of our communities.On top of that, we have also indicated that, in the course of this week - in fact, tomorrow - we will be introducing two bills that will deliver a fourfold increase in renewable energy in Australia by 2020. This is legislation around the renewable energy target. The government is committed to 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply to come from renewable energy by 2020 through establishing an expanded renewable energy target - a matter upon which those opposite received copious advice when they occupied the treasury bench, advice which they systematically ignored.In addition to the introduction of this legislation for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the renewable energy target, the government has, through the budget, announced a $1.365 billion measure: the Solar Flagships program. What we seek to do through this measure is, with the private sector investment, to get behind investment in 1,000 megawatts of solar electricity generation capacity in Australia, which once constructed would represent three times more power than the existing largest solar energy project anywhere in the world, currently in California. This would see Australia occupying, as it should, a position of leadership on solar energy given the copious supply of sunshine in our country and therefore the ability to rise to a national and international challenge to bring solar to the forefront.In addition to that, there will be an Australian centre for renewable energy and further, of course, the measures we have taken through the Solar Homes and Communities Plan. A figure which was mentioned yesterday by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts was that, after 12 years in office, some 10,000 max - or 10½ thousand, I think - solar panels were produced on people's roofs courtesy of the pre-existing government's program. In 18 months in office, we have provided support for 80,000 solar panels right across Australia in addition to what will be the energy insulation program being rolled out across owner occupied dwellings across the country. This is a $4 billion investment to again reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the future and, of course, we will do our bit through the solar panels program to do the same.The solar credits system, which will exist under the renewable energy target, will take the place of the existing Solar Homes and Communities Plan. We, therefore, await with interest what happens with the voting on the renewable energy target legislation because it will contain within it the mechanisms through which solar credits will be delivered to Australian households to support solar panels in the future. That is where the vote which will occur in the House and in the Senate is of direct relevance to mums and dads across the country. Their ability from 9 June to access those renewable energy credits for the purposes of obtaining a further reduction in the price of solar panels which they would purchase for their homes in the future rests entirely on the vote to be taken in the Senate.Today the Clean Energy Council released a report by Access Economics which shows that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies would create an extra 28,000 new full-time jobs by 2020. According to the report by Access Economics, the government's expanded renewable energy target by 2018 will support an additional 4,000 full-time equivalent positions in that year.These are important measures - important measures for our international negotiating posture around the Kyoto table, important measures in terms of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, important measures in terms of the renewable energy target and important measures about the future of the Murray-Darling, the Great Barrier Reef and Kakadu, as well as about our place in bringing about a global solution to the problem of climate change presented to us all. For these measures to have effect will require support on the part of those opposite in the Senate. The government does not control the numbers in the Senate. This goes right to the question: what will be the future of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme under the voting which will be undertaken in the Senate through the Liberals and the Nationals opposite?I was advised today that there is a Senate inquiry report back from those who were looking at the CPRS. Normally there is a majority report or a minority report, a government report or an opposition report. I am advised today that not only was there a government report and an opposition report but there was a Liberal report and another Liberal report - one saying, 'Yes, we'll have a bit,' and one saying, 'No, we believe that climate change is something which does not exist. You just need a few shade cloths to make it better in the future.' That is what happened on the CPRS with the Senate report which has just come in.Then you go to the RET, the renewable energy target. I would have thought that those opposite would have embraced this with open arms, yet our good friends over there in cocky corner, the National Party, have gone out there and said they are going to knock it - the renewable energy target - on the head as well. I do not understand why. Let me say to the Nationals: when you have got the Liberals divided from the Nationals on the renewable energy target and the Liberals divided against the Liberals on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, is it any wonder we have not had a single question in this place on climate change in recent weeks when this legislation is making its way through the parliament?This is where the rubber hits the road: renewable energy certificates will be necessary for Australian households to obtain deductions for their future purchases of solar panels, and that depends on the passage of this legislation through the Senate. As those opposite all bury themselves in their books at this point, this is a very important matter for working families. Working families want to know whether they will have support or opposition in the Senate to the renewable energy target legislation, because that will determine whether or not there is going to be support for credits in the future to bring the cost of solar panels down. These are the options we face. The government's legislative agenda is clear: we ratified Kyoto, we have got CPRS legislation in the House and we have got RET legislation in the House. This is in our first 18 months in office, after 12 years of obfuscation by those opposite. I would say to those who want solar panels on their roofs that we need the Liberal Party and the National Party to get behind the government and support us on this measure and the CPRS. Our collective future and that of working families depends on it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I say to the member that I am very happy to look into the specifics that he has raised with me. I will do that, and I am happy to take any details from him that he may have. The system in Victoria for the provision of projects is that the Victorian government bundles projects and they then have head contractors who contract with local contractors to deliver the projects. I am very happy to look at the circumstances the member raises. Obviously I want to be very clear with members in the House and people generally that this is an economic stimulus program to build the infrastructure of tomorrow and to invest in and support Australian jobs today. Not every building company that wants to work on Building the Education Revolution will end up with work. Obviously, though, if Building the Education Revolution were not there, the people who are working on those projects would not have their jobs supported by this program. So what I would ask the member to reflect on is whether or not he thinks that this work should be available to support jobs. If he thinks the answer to that is yes then he might want to reflect on why it is that he voted against the program. If we were delivering nothing - as the member voted for and as the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister believe - then he and I would not be talking today about whose jobs are being supported by the program; there would be no jobs supported by the program. His political party's strategy is to support no jobs through this program.I also say to the member opposite - and I understand he was not in the last parliament but he may want to look at the Hansard of the last parliament - that, before he makes calls about referring things to the Auditor-General, he may want to reflect on the regional rorts scandal of the former government and the findings of the Auditor-General about that. He may want to reflect on the performance of the then Prime Minister in supporting the ministers who were involved in the regional rorts scandal, including National Party ministers. He may want to ask himself the question: should he, when he looks at the program of Building the Education Revolution, be taking the view that this is a program for all schools around the country? We have not paid any regard to whether or not the schools are in my electorate, one of my colleagues' electorates, a Liberal electorate, a National Party electorate or an Independent member's electorate. We have said that every school should benefit under Building the Education Revolution.I say this to the member opposite: the track record of his political party and the former government was not to benefit places around the country; it was to benefit places they saw political advantage in. If he is under any doubt about that then the Auditor-General can help him with that conclusion, because the Auditor-General dealt with it fulsomely. So, on the question of audit reports, the one I would be recommending to members opposite for reading tonight is the one about their conduct in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. I know that, coming from Adelaide, he has a keen interest in the solar industry continuing to grow there. Getting behind Australia's solar industry is a crucial part of this government's strong support for clean energy in Australia. The Prime Minister has already informed the House that we will support the highest ever uptake of solar panels on rooftops right around Australia. We have more than quadrupled our election commitment, with 80,000 installations set to take place from the time that the Rudd government came to office.We are providing long-term support for solar panels through the new solar credits, which will become effective as of 9 June through the renewable energy target. This means a steady transition for solar businesses who have already got more than a year's worth of installations in the pipeline. Critically - and for people listening - solar credits will be open to everyone. There is no means test on solar credits. It is open to households, businesses and community groups. Solar credits will not be subject to annual budget cycles. That means long-term certainty for Australia's solar industry to grow and invest over time.The government really does understand that we need to build clean energy industries in order to be competitive and we need to have a carbon price through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme with an expanded solar energy target and solar credits. I think it is important to identify what is at stake at this point in time. Real action on climate change is necessary. Clean energy jobs are necessary. Providing investment certainty is necessary. This is the trifecta of necessary actions to put Australia on a good path to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and building industry. But that is not what we have got from the coalition. We still do not have it. With a history of 12 years of tinkering around the edges, they have failed to embrace emissions trading and they have failed to embrace the renewable energy target. As the Prime Minister noted previously, they outright rejected increasing the renewable energy target in 2004. In response to the Tambling review, the coalition said very bluntly that they 'will not extend or increase the target'. It could not be clearer than that. That was the position in 2004 from the coalition: they would not extend or increase the target.Apparently, it is a different story now. I note that the member for Flinders said on 1 May that the coalition would soon announce a 'more ambitious renewable energy policy' than the government's 20 per cent target by 2020. It is very easy to have policies when you do not actually announce them, and this is very similar to what the shadow minister said on 4 February when the coalition lined up to oppose the energy efficient homes plan - the largest rollout of energy efficiency in Australia's history, the complementary action that is necessary when you are taking real action on climate change. Here the shadow minister said:_ we will come back with more details of an energy efficiency package.We have not seen that one either. But we should not be surprised, because the coalition have adopted the government's climate change targets but have got no plan to achieve them. They have got an imaginary energy efficiency policy, an imaginary renewable energy policy and, from what the National Party said today, it looks like we will have an imaginary emissions trading scheme as well. I noticed Senator Boswell in today's Financial Review has said:I don't see how we could put the RET legislation through without the ETS. I do not see how you can support it _ because there would be no transitional assistance. None of the EITE industries _ would get any protection.Amen! There is a very clear solution for the National Party, for the Liberal Party and for the Leader of the Opposition: support the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, support the renewable energy target, support the energy efficiency home package, and let us get on with the business of bringing these clean industries that will support Australians in future into this place, which is what Australia so needs.

 - I note the member's question and note his reference to the Auditor-General. He may be interested in his spare time to study these reports from the Auditor-General about the regional rorts program in the last parliament. He may, when he studies those reports about the regional rorts of the Liberal and National parties when in government, want to offer some apologies for them - or maybe the leader of the party will do it on his behalf. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In responding to the member's question, I can make it absolutely clear to him - as it is absolutely clear to school authorities, be they state or territory government school authorities or block grant authorities in the Catholic or independent sector - that we have limits in the Building the Education Revolution program as to expenditure on administration and project costs. What is made clear by the guidelines is that when project management is being undertaken by an arm of a state or territory government the Commonwealth will provide 1.5 per cent above BER project costs to administer proper implementation. We have also said under the guidelines - and they are there on the website for the member to see - that four per cent has been identified as an industry standard for project management for the purposes of the Building the Education Revolution program. They are the guidelines of the program, and of course the guidelines of the program will be enforced as necessary.I say to the member opposite that the central issue here is whether he supports expenditure on his local schools. He voted against it. His local school communities would be endorsing this program. His principals and teachers would be delighted about its possibilities. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The central point that the shadow minister needs to address is to be very honest with all members of the Australian community. If he had his way, not one dollar of this program would be being spent - not one school building, not one library. - That's rubbish! The Liberal Party can now nominate what expenditure it agrees to in Building the Education Revolution. If it is less than $14.7 billion, it can table the list of schools that would miss out under its program. It could do that. The shadow minister and the leader could explain why they voted holus-bolus against this program instead of seeking to amend it to the Liberal authorised figure. If the shadow minister over there is the custodian of an alternative plan, in the interests of transparency in politics he should table it, including, very importantly, the list of schools which would miss out. I am sure the member who has asked this question would want to know, under Liberal Party policy, which schools in his electorate would miss out so that he could walk through those gates and say honestly, 'The policy of my political party is that you should get nothing.' Well, actually, the policy of his political party at the moment is that he should be walking through every school gate and saying, 'The policy of my political party is you get nothing.'This is a huge program, with $14.7 billion being rolled out to build the infrastructure of tomorrow under the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. It is being delivered urgently for a good purpose - that is, to support jobs today. It is being used for that purpose, and we have said that, when you are rolling out something this big and this quickly for a good reason, it is inevitable that from time to time there will be questions, comments, concerns and criticisms. As we hear those questions, comments, concerns and criticisms we deal with them. The basic proposition here is: do you support schools or don't you? We say yes; you say no. That is the fundamental divide.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. As members will, of course, be aware, the Iranian election was completed on 12 June and on 13 June the Iran Election Commission announced the re-election of President Ahmadinejad. This result has caused great controversy in Iran. Overnight we saw thousands of Iranians in Tehran protesting that result. It is now crystal clear -  - I am pleased to acknowledge the member's complete lack of interest in what is occurring in Iran. - Mr Speaker, I am happy to ignore the interjection but it is impossible to ignore his complete indifference. I assume that that reflects the attitude of those opposite. It is now crystal clear that there are very grave doubts about the result so far as the Iranian election is concerned. Two of the main challengers, Mr Mousavi and the former speaker, Mr Karroubi, have indicated that they want the election result to be cancelled. The main challenger, Mr Mousavi, has filed an official complaint against the election result and he has been joined in that respect by the third challenger, Mr Razai. Australia, as with other members of the international community, is watching these developments very carefully and closely. We urge the Iranian authorities, the Iranian government, to ensure that the issues raised by the three challengers are dealt with promptly and transparently. We very strongly hope that the commitment made by the Supreme Leader that these matters will be reviewed leads to a thorough and transparent review and investigation.In some respects more importantly - and hence my riposte to the member opposite - we are gravely concerned about both the reports and the images of the serious human rights abuses we have seen on camera and in photos in the last 24 to 36 hours in Tehran. That is why I admonish the member opposite. We are very gravely concerned about the very serious breaches of human rights we have seen. We join the UN Secretary-General, we join President Obama and we join our colleges from the European Union and the United Kingdom in underlining very seriously our condemnation of these events and our call for restraint by the Iranian authorities. That is why I admonish the member opposite - for his complete indifference on human rights matters. We urge the Iranian government to -  - The Australian government has, of course, over the period made very strong representations to the Iranian government about serious human rights breaches. We underline those serious human rights breaches so far as the right of Iranians to protest peacefully is concerned. Like other members of the international community, Australia was impressed by the robust debate that we saw in the context and course of the election campaign. It would be most distressing if the spirit of that debate during the election campaign were not reflected by an election outcome which properly reflected the will of the Iranian people.Putting those issues to one side - those serious breaches of human rights and our concern to ensure the election reflects the will of the Iranian people - there is in my view a more fundamental point to make. Irrespective of the outcome of the election, what is absolutely crucial for the international community and for Iran is that Iran changes its policy approach so far as its nuclear program in particular is concerned and so far as its treatment of human rights issues is concerned. These points have been made crystal clear by me in recent times to my counterpart, Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki, and to his Deputy Foreign Minister Akhundzadeh. The time for Iran to engage properly with the international community, to respond positively to the overtures by the Obama administration, is now here. Iran needs to change its course, respond to the concerns of the International Atomic Energy Agency and act consistently with United Nations Security Council resolutions. If it does not, Iran runs the risk of further isolating itself and runs the risk of doing further damage to its standing in the international community and continuing to add to concern about its nuclear program.We hope that the Supreme Leader's undertaking for a review of these matters is effected transparently and promptly. More importantly, we hope that Iran changes policies in respect of these matters. And I would certainly hope that there would be a general, bipartisan approach in these matters.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question, because it gives me the opportunity to clarify some misrepresentations that have been made in the public debate about award modernisation. Point No. 1: award modernisation has been sought by employers in this country for decades. They wanted a simple, modern award system. Indeed, I recall, when the Howard government was in government and the member for Menzies was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, he would come into this parliament and his daily sight gag was to hold up an award and to go through clauses that he viewed as archaic or overly complex. - He is nodding and saying that that did happen. When we came into office, despite statements by members opposite and ministers in their governments that they would do something about award modernisation, what in fact we inherited was Work Choices - a system where the award system was slated for a slow and painful death and a system of individual statutory employment agreements which were about ripping off working Australians, particularly those most at risk. I thank the member for Higgins for reaffirming in his press conference today that he is still a supporter of individual statutory employment agreements. Maybe, with him raising the issue, the Liberal Party will be forced to come clean about what it will support at the next election about individual statutory employment agreements and about a return to Work Choices.On award modernisation, what the shadow minister knows - and he does not always say it - is that the independent industrial umpire is engaged in an almost two-year process of award modernisation. The independent industrial umpire is working on transitional provisions that will take a full five years to come into effect. Those transitional provisions will therefore enable a smoothing of award modernisation. We understand that when you are modifying awards you are coming off different circumstances in different states. The industrial umpire is working through those issues and working through them well. The five-year transitional provisions are still to come. What the shadow minister also knows is that from time to time I have amended the award modernisation request if I have been persuaded that there is a significant issue that needs to be addressed. I did that recently in relation to the restaurants and hospitality area. We are obviously in continuing dialogue with employer groups, other stakeholders and individual employers as the award modernisation process works its way through.What I would say to the shadow minister opposite as well is: if he was being very clear with this parliament he would acknowledge that the Liberal Party voted for this award modernisation process in the first piece of industrial legislation I presented to this parliament. What he would also acknowledge is the amendments that he is moving in the Senate would put the employers that he is talking about at risk of a sudden drop, a sudden change of standards, at the end of five years instead of a phased-in, gradual transition. We support fairness and decency in Australian workplaces. We support less red tape for employers. We support simple modern awards. We support a system of sensible and measured transition. And, of course, this is the side of the parliament that supports economic stimulus in supporting jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. The government has set out its economic and fiscal strategy in the budget, and that is focused on three things: first, stimulating economic activity and sustaining jobs in the shorter term; second, investing for the longer term in the infrastructure and skills needed to drive the productivity growth that is crucial for Australia's future prosperity; and, third, returning the budget to surplus in the medium term, repairing the fiscal damage that has been done by the global financial crisis.It is true to say that there have been some criticisms of the government's economic strategy - not many, but some - from the wider community and the business community, but most particularly from the Liberal-National parties opposition. I note with some interest that the focus of these criticisms tends to be on matters like the interest rates being paid by long-term bond holders, for example - that was early on in question time today. You do not hear a great deal from the opposition about jobs. You do not hear much from them about sustaining employment in the face of a global recession that is threatening the Australian economy and bearing down on economic activity. But, unfortunately, this is not the biggest problem with the criticisms from the opposition of the government's economic strategy. They are entitled to choose their angles. They are entitled to choose the critique that they pursue against the government's position. The biggest problem, however, lies with accuracy and coherence. It lies with their constant inability to get basic points correct. It lies with them, in particular the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, consistently getting it wrong.Now that the Higgins sideshow is over, the Costello sideshow has concluded, there is a very different situation that prevails with respect to the opposition. They have had three shadow treasurers in 18 months and I think people have been letting the member for North Sydney off a little bit lightly because they have assumed that he would not be shadow Treasurer by the time of the election on the current turnover rate. I think that has now changed because the person looming over both him and the opposition leader has pulled the pin. - I would just like to remind the House of a few examples of the problems that the member for North Sydney has with respect to accuracy and coherence. He claimed the budget papers showed that the government would need eight years of two per cent of GDP plus surpluses to pay off debt as projected, unfortunately neglecting to point out that in order for that to be true there would have to be zero growth in GDP for 10 years. In other words, he forgot that GDP grows over time, as projected in the budget. In a debate on Lateline with me he claimed that the current account deficit never hit six per cent of GDP under the Howard government. Guess what it was when we took office, when we inherited government from the previous government? It was well over six per cent of GDP.The day after the budget the member for North Sydney claimed that the Howard government had saved all of the windfall money from the mining boom, something that even Treasury research at the time demonstrated was completely untrue. After the budget, the member for North Sydney claimed that two-thirds of the projected deficits could be explained by the government's spending, conveniently neglecting to put in the equation a number of very substantial government savings measures. He just happened to overlook those parts of the equation.Recently, the member for North Sydney and, indeed, the Leader of the Opposition have been claiming that projected government borrowing - not actual government borrowing yet but projected government borrowing over a number of years - is putting upward pressure on global interest rates that, in turn, is increasing interest rates in Australia, when Australian government borrowing as a fraction is 0.001 of total global government borrowing. He has also accused me of not including, within the budget, projections for IT savings which I have talked up at some considerable length, failing to notice that in the budget update, the Updated Economic and Fiscal Outlook published in February - which he should, as shadow Treasurer, have read - there is in fact a statement of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of savings from the IT changes that the government is putting in place.These are just the highlights, or the lowlights. But there is of course a wider picture that, soon, the opposition and the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition are going to have to start filling in. The shadow Treasurer has said that the solution to Australia's economic problems is quite simple: 'The government should spend less money.' Unfortunately, the actions of the opposition, the positions they are adopting and their behaviour in the Senate all point in the other direction. They have not yet announced a single savings proposal - not one. They continue to block government savings initiatives in the Senate. The shadow Treasurer has indicated that they would continue with the government stimulus initiatives. And they keep making expensive new promises into the bargain.We are now beyond the halfway mark in the parliamentary cycle and the business end of the season is approaching. The time when the opposition can get away with loose rhetoric, inaccuracies and 'facts' that are incorrect in the economic critique of the government's position is rapidly running out. We are going to hold the opposition to account on its rhetoric. We are going to hold the member for North Sydney to account on his rhetoric as we look forward to the time when the Turnbull opposition fronts up to the next election with the list of spending cuts, the list of savings, the list of cuts to programs and the list of increased taxes that it is proposing to put in place, if elected to office, in order to fulfil the position that it is adopting today. That is the implication of the opposition's position; that is where they are heading. They are heading for a collision with reality. It is coming sooner than they think. We are looking forward to the time when they have to specify exactly what they are going to do for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I thank him for the fact that he voted for the award modernisation process he is now criticising. I would correct him: it is not my award modernisation process; it is one that was voted for in this parliament, and he voted for it, and it is being undertaken by the independent industrial umpire.Now I understand that members of the opposition hate independent industrial umpires. That is why they brought Work Choices to this country: to ensure that working people could be ripped off without the protection of an independent umpire. That is what they believe in so I know that they hate independent industrial umpires. But this process is being undertaken by the independent industrial umpire.I do not accept the figures put in the question by the member. I did not accept the figures put in the question by the shadow minister. But what I can say to the members opposite, as I have explained before and as the member is obviously completely ignoring in his question, is this: this is a reform long sought by employers. This would be a simple modern award. Why should employers who are maybe around border regions between states be under two completely different systems? He would find those employers saying to him that they want a more efficient system, and this will be one.Then we are talking of course about a five-year measured phase-in that the industrial umpire is working through now. And for the member's information, from time to time as necessary, if there has been a significant issue with award modernisation, I have varied my award modernisation request, and I continue to consult with employers, including employers who represent the sector that he raises in the parliament today. - But I also say to members opposite, and it is something that I find really remarkable: I would have said about the past Liberal government that there were some people in it who actually came to this parliament to engage in reform. There were some people in it who actually understood that when you are engaging in reform that matters for the future that is a difficult process. It requires work with stakeholders. We are engaged in a difficult process that requires work with stakeholders. It is a process that was too difficult for the former Liberal government and instead they went down the rip-off route of Work Choices. When you are engaged in a reform process, yes, I understand that there is anxiety for people and they are watching the process carefully. I absolutely understand that, which is why I maintain a very strong dialogue with the employer organisations that represent sectors like the one the member has raised in this parliament. But when you are engaged in reform, you work with the reform process.At the moment the opposition are carping and whingeing about this government's reform and, at the same time, they are not clear about what they would do. I suspect that they are not clear because they are internally divided, not on the outcome but on the process. Their internal division is: 'Should we go to the next election loud and proud as Work Choices supporters or should we try and hide that fact?' Why don't they try resolving that and being honest about it? - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and I note that the government is undertaking the most sweeping investment in our history. We are spending more on rail in 12 months than those opposite spent in 12 long years. Part of the Nation Building and Jobs Program, the $42 billion economic stimulus, was $150 million over two years to install boom gates and other safety measures at 292 high-risk level crossings.I note that those opposite object to this program, which is consistent with the fact that they voted against this program in spite of the fact that there are more than 100 accidents at these level crossings each year. How did we identify which level crossings should be fixed? We went out there and we consulted with the industry - namely, with Trevor Martyn, the Chairman of the Australian Trucking Association, who has had this to say:The upgrades are desperately needed. The government has worked closely with the trucking industry to determine the level crossings that will be upgraded. The funding is a great win for Queensland truck drivers, train drivers and everyone who uses the state's road system.That is what the trucking sector are saying about our program.As a result of the analysis, we did not do what they did with the regional rorts program. We did what we are doing with the education revolution. Indeed, 167 of these level crossings are to be fixed in Liberal Party and National Party seats. Fifty-seven per cent of them are in Liberal Party and National Party seats. In spite of that, this program is so offensive that they continue to interject against it.Of course, in spite of the fact that they interjected against it and they voted against the nation-building program legislation in the parliament here two weeks ago, members of the House of Representatives who came into this chamber and voted against black spot funding in their electorates, against roads funding in their electorates and against rail funding in their electorates should be aware that it sailed through the Senate today - no divisions, no votes, no anything. Whereas they actually had the numbers, potentially, in the Senate, where they were engaged in a blocking operation, they did not have the ticker because they know that their position simply does not add up. So now we not only have members of the opposition doing one thing in Canberra and another thing in their electorates; they are doing one thing in the House of Representatives and another thing in the Senate. They are so inconsistent when it comes to nation building.Of course, they will turn up to announcements. Indeed, the member for Grey, a true coalition opportunist, said this on radio the other day: 'I'll attend the opening of any infrastructure programs.' I am sure he will, and I will keep the member for Grey posted because we will be having infrastructure openings right around the country, whether they be in schools, on level crossings, on roads, on rail or at ports. We are committed to this program. Indeed, we have been getting on with the job. Already, by the end of this month, in Victoria 20 out of 59 level crossings will have been completed - 20 level crossings made safer and jobs created while that was occurring. In Queensland eight will have been completed by the end of this month, making these level crossings even safer.I am pleased to say that I got a bit of correspondence addressed to me just recently. Indeed, it is from the shadow minister for, amongst other things, regional development and infrastructure and transport. That is a pretty serious title. He had this to say:I write to thank you for identifying the sites Espie Street, Larapinta Drive and Lovegrove Drive in Alice Springs to be included in the boom gates for rail crossings program. As the Northern Territory local member for Braitling, two of these three boom gates are situated within my electorate. Within the past nine months there have been numerous near misses involving train versus vehicle -  - You might want to actually listen to this:due to the lack of lights not working properly, no boom gates or impatient drivers. This program is a great initiative to improving and preventing accidents at level crossings. - It continues:I look forward to seeing the work undertaken this financial year.Yours sincerelyAdam Giles MLA, member for Braitling, Northern Territory.Not only is he the member for Braitling, representing the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory and the shadow minister for regional development, infrastructure and transport, he was the Country Liberal Party candidate at the last federal election against the member for Lingiari. So at the last election he stood against this side of the House but now he is prepared to stand up with this side of the House against the opportunism that we see day after day from those opposite. Their opportunism was highlighted today by their folding like a deck of cards in the Senate on our nation-building program legislation.</DOC>

 - Methinks he doth protest too much. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he is standing there as the single living roadblock to many businesses in Australia having access to finance to support jobs in the construction industry. He knows full well there has been a line-up of people from business and the finance community who have been to see him, saying, 'Will you please stand out of the road in order to provide decent Australian firms with finance to go out there and continue their projects and build jobs.' He knows he is under the spotlight on this, hence we have this great spray up the front today in order to try and take some pressure off him. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: this stands as one of the more reckless acts in which the Liberal Party has engaged in recent times. If you listen to the tenor of the questions put into the House of Representatives by the Leader of the Opposition over the last week or so, they have been along the lines of the availability of finance and the cost of finance. What does this team opposite then go around and do in the Senate? They block finance and its availability to business. This is a complete contradiction in the position they have sought to put forward in this House.Following this act of economic vandalism by those opposite to wreck projects and to wreck jobs at a time of global recession, could I draw to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition comments this morning from the director of corporate affairs of Westfield, who said, 'Like the stimulus packages, this piece of legislation was very important for confidence and jobs.' I notice the Leader of the Opposition is having an objection to Westfield. - We will be coming on to HIH fairly soon, and the record, because I know the Leader of the Opposition had a particular interest in that matter. But let us just leave that for a time. Let us not rake over the coals just now. For that matter, so did the member for North Sydney, who presided over the implosion of a great Australian financial institution. The member for North Sydney was the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation at the time. What happened? We saw the implosion of a great institution in which apparently a current member of the Liberal Party sitting at a front seat -  - The great thing about the member for North Sydney is that the more he bellows the less the content is. The member for North Sydney was also interjecting about comments from Westfield. Yesterday or the day before Frank Lowy from Westfield was asked down there at the National Press Club about what actually was contributing to Australia's relatively better economic performance globally. What was his response? Frank Lowy from Westfield has businesses in the United States. He has businesses in the United Kingdom. He said there were three answers: government stimulus, government stimulus and government stimulus. That is what Westfield had to say. I draw that to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition because Westfield and a whole bunch of other companies are out there from the property sector saying to the Liberal Party, 'Why don't you just get out of the road and do something constructive for the economy rather than always talking the economy down?'Similarly this morning, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, we had the chief executive of the Property Council of Australia - another front for world socialism, apparently - say the following:You know, Australia was ahead of the pack here in recognising there was a potential problem with foreign banks in particular being directed to reinvest in home countries by their new owners' foreign governments, but, now the Japanese and Americans have recognised the same problem, they have put in contingency plans and we have not. So now we are behind the game. It was elegant, it was simple, it was transparent and we have missed an opportunity. Credit is still very difficult to get in Australia and this is totally different from the recession of the nineties. Foreign banks in particular play a crucial role in the way that they did not last time around in the recession.So says the chief executive of the Property Council of Australia. The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition knows this. His colleagues know that. They have had one representative of an industry association after another into them asking why they will not just get out of the road and allow this measure to pass the parliament so that finance can be delivered to real projects by real companies to create real jobs for Australia.Can I say to those opposite on this question as they reflect - and I am sure the member for North Sydney is reflecting on his stupendous achievements as minister for financial regulation back then, and of course on the Leader of the Opposition's achievements when he was the member for Goldman Sachs - is that what this goes to is a very simple question of politics versus economics. We are saying we need to get out there and support businesses to create jobs and to uncloud the lines of finance for businesses to get jobs and projects going. Those opposite have simply engaged on a negative political strategy to block everything in the Senate and to talk the economy down. The contrast is here for all to see: a government in the business of trying to boost the Australian economy up and lift us out this global recession and a leader of the Liberal Party determined to do everything he can to negatively talk the Australian economy down. On this day those in search of Australian jobs and those supporting Australian companies will hang their heads in disbelief that the so-called party of business has left them marooned by this action.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. They think the whole topic of jobs in Australia is funny. They will not support any constructive measures in this House to support employment. They have consistently opposed in this House economic stimulus that is providing support to tens of thousands of Australian families who have breadwinners because this government had the courage to put in place economic stimulus. But what we saw in the Senate last night was perhaps the most brazen example of political opportunism that we have ever seen from the Leader of the Opposition - and we have seen many. We remember his statement that 'not one job had been created by economic stimulus'. There have been tens of thousands of jobs supported by economic stimulus. We on this side of the House are absolutely determined to do everything that we can, in the face of a global recession, to support domestic employment.The Australian Business Investment Partnership is very important given the global recession. It is a commonsense measure. As the Prime Minister was saying before, it is supported strongly by the business community. It is supported strongly by the small business community. They understand that if finance is withdrawn by international financiers then the jobs of tens of thousands of people are on the line. But those opposite simply want to play politics. The Leader of the Opposition would rather see the nation fail than the Rudd government succeed. That is their attitude to this particular proposition. It is the case that the business community strongly supports this measure. It is important that a measure like this should pass because it does have important and dramatic impacts upon confidence.As the CEO of the Property Council said this morning, 'The confidence dividend this would have delivered will now be lost.' It just goes to show how little the opposition understand about the challenge of this global recession and how little they understand about the need to support employment and small business that they could engage in such a reckless act. This is a measure that is required. It is a very important contingency measure. If worst comes to worst and they do not change their minds and projects fail and jobs are lost, it will be on their heads. It will be on their heads if jobs are lost. What we see from this mob is an enormous amount of cheap outrage and feigned indignation when they know we are doing the right thing by the country.There is not a conservative government anywhere else in the world that has not engaged in economic stimulus like we have and that has not put in place a measure similar to this. The only group that stand out in that debate are the Liberal and National parties of Australia, who have no comprehension of the nature of the challenge that we are facing. They are playing the politics of calculation; they are not playing the politics of conviction. They are sitting back and waiting to see people lose their jobs because they think that is to their political advantage. That will most certainly not be supported by the Australian people, who want governments to take action and to put in place decent, commonsense initiatives such as ABIP - which is what we have done.</DOC>

 - There we go: more opportunistic scare campaigns from those opposite - absolutely opportunistic scare campaigns with little basis in fact. He knows very well that the net debt of state governments is entirely manageable. He knows that - he has seen the figures - but he will come into this House and say and do anything to make a political point and he will distort any figure. This morning the whistle has been blown on the shadow treasurer, the member for North Sydney. This morning in the Sydney Morning Herald I think his approach was summed up appropriately by Ross Gittins. This was his conclusion:If the Opposition persists with such destructive and dishonest arguments it risks the public concluding it's willing to wreck the economy it seeks to govern.That is the conclusion of the scare campaign that is being run by those opposite over a long period of time. Let us go through the argument. This is what Ross Gittins had to say this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald:In seeking to capitalise on the Commonwealth's rate rise, Joe Hockey went beyond the pale _ In his anxiety to score a point _ Hockey was willing to reinforce the mistaken and damaging notion that interest rates are on the way up. And to convey the impression that this minor rise is just the first of many, Hockey was willing to bamboozle the public with a patently false economic argument.He went on to say this, and the member for North Sydney should listen very closely to it:His argument about the effect of government borrowing on interest rates is simply wrong.He went on to say:If we lived in an economy cut off from the rest of the world, where the only money available to be borrowed was our own savings, then borrowing by governments would indeed put upward pressure on the interest rates you and I pay.He went on to say:But for at least the past 25 years, we've lived in a world of deregulated and globalised financial markets, in which our banks and big companies can and do borrow heavily overseas. In that vast, global market, our Government's borrowings are a flea bite _That is what he said. Then he went on to say:If the Opposition persists with such destructive and dishonest arguments it risks the public concluding it's willing to wreck the economy _</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. She convened a very good series of meetings with Newcastle business on my recent visit and she is a strong supporter of the need to protect and support Australian jobs. The global economic recession is continuing to impact on Australia and on jobs. While the worst of times may not be over by a long shot, the evidence clearly shows that the government's stimulus packages have been working. Without the stimulus packages, the economy would have contracted in the recent quarter rather than grown. We have seen a big boost in business and consumer confidence. Consumer confidence recorded its largest increase in 22 years in June and is at its highest level since January 2008.But last week's employment figures make it clear that, while we are in much better shape than the rest of the world, we still face a significant jobs challenge ahead - not least in the commercial property sector. We have seen continued volatility in that sector through commercial finance figures falling sharply in April after a sharp rise in March. This is a sector in which confidence and stability are paramount. As the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and other economic ministers and I talk to businesspeople around the country, we constantly hear them telling us that one of the biggest challenges facing them is the potential flight of foreign capital as banks return to their home markets.Is it any wonder, then, that the Australian business community is frustrated and angry at the naked opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition? The business community knows how important access to finance is in supporting jobs. But the supposed party of business is refusing to listen to business. Last night in the Senate, the coalition showed that it was willing to roll the dice and gamble with the jobs of 150,000 Australians involved in the commercial property sector.Australian business knows how important the Australian Business Investment Partnership is. Both the Master Builders Association and the Property Council have been calling for bipartisan support for ABIP. Remember bipartisanship? We used to hear a lot about it from the Leader of the Opposition. I would have thought that a good way to show bipartisanship would be to support an initiative supported by so much of Australian business.The Urban Taskforce perhaps best summarised the importance of the partnership for the Australian economy. They said:The economy will pay a heavy price if this legislation is blocked. Without this legislation we may see a further reduction in confidence, a deeper economic downturn and postponed economic recovery.We may see a deeper economic downturn and postponed recovery because of the recklessness and opportunism of the member for Wentworth.You might have thought that confidence and stability in the commercial property sector and all the jobs that go with it would be important to the Leader of the Opposition. But unfortunately it appears that it is not. We all see the Leader of the Opposition's relief and joy on Monday at the announcement from the member for Higgins that he was retiring from politics, an announcement which protected the Leader of the Opposition's job for a little while longer. But he is prepared to roll the dice for thousands of jobs of the Australian people. We saw joy from the Leader of the Opposition on Monday, while he votes down an initiative to support Australian jobs.And we have seen more of this. I saw the member for Mayo on Sky Agenda this morning, debating the Parliamentary Secretary for Employment. He said, 'We're very pleased to have been able to stop it.' There is something unseemly about a member of parliament gloating that they have stopped an initiative to support Australian jobs. The other side rejoice in Australian jobs being put at risk. They would much rather protect their own jobs than the jobs of ordinary Australians.When John Howard was Prime Minister of Australia, he painted himself as the champion of battlers; of tradies; of tradespersons; of plumbers; of electricians; of carpenters. The Leader of the Opposition has thrown that mantle away. These are the very people whose jobs he is recklessly attacking - all in the name of political opportunism. Across Australia at boardroom tables there are businesspeople shaking their heads at the recklessness of the Leader of the Opposition. Across Australia at kitchen tables there are workers shaking their heads at the opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has become just as out of touch with the boardroom table as he has always been with the kitchen table.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Longman for his question. The House might not be aware that the member for Longman, in the early 1990s, was instrumental in setting up the Business Enterprise Centre at Caboolture. I thank him on behalf of the small businesses on the Sunshine Coast of Australia for his ongoing interest - the ongoing interest of everyone on this side of the parliament in the future of small business in this country. I note yet again that my opponent, the shadow minister for small business, will not ask me a question about small business.Yet again the opposition leader has put his own base political interests ahead of the interests of the small businesses of Australia. We know that the Australian Business Investment Partnership is designed to support commercial property construction and development during the global financial crisis. We also know - and the opposition leader knows - that the commercial property sector employs around 150,000 people, including plumbers, electricians and carpenters. The advice of Treasury is that, without action, a combination of weak demand and tight credit conditions could result in up to 50,000 people losing their jobs in this sector. These are ordinary people, these are small business people, these are tradies, these are independent contractors.The Liberal Party claim small business operators as their own core constituency, but last night the Liberal Party betrayed the small business people of Australia. Last night the Liberal Party and its cohorts in the National Party betrayed the tradies and independent contractors - our electricians, our plumbers and our carpenters. That is what the opposition did, and they are boasting about it today at the doors. They are proud of their achievement in betraying the small business community of this country.The opposition leader talks about jobs, jobs, jobs, but his actions and those of his party last night have taken jobs away. He has risked the jobs of up to 50,000 Australians. The opposition leader is saying to the tradies, to our plumbers, electricians and carpenters: 'Pack up your tools in your old kit bag; it's goodbye, bye, bye.' You regard the small businesses of Australia as your core constituency. Well, why on earth would you betray them? Why would you betray them? And we know the answer to that question: because by your actions, by the opposition leader's actions -  - he is trying to distance himself from the truth, from his past. - I can advise the opposition leader that rehearsals were at 12 o'clock today, and we are looking pretty good! - This is the plot: the opposition are distancing themselves from their past. Let us have a look at the opposition's economic team: we have got the opposition leader living in the leafy eastern suburbs of Sydney, we have got the shadow Treasurer living in the leafy northern suburbs of Sydney -  -  - and we have got the shadow finance minister -  -  - who, again, lives in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, in Woollahra. They are lovely suburbs, lovely suburbs. If you go to Woollahra, if you go to North Sydney, if you go to Frenchs Forest, they are lovely places to visit. - I am not finished.The member for Dickson then left the chamber. - Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye! - I do say to the member for Dickson: pack up your troubles in the old kit bag; it's goodbye, goodbye, goodbye! -  - This is nothing but rank opportunism. It is a naked attempt to distance themselves from their true past, from their true values. They say, 'Oh no, we're not with big business; we're for small business.' Last night and today, you betrayed the small business people of Australia. The only job you care about is your own.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for the question. Illegal and unsustainable logging is often presented as being purely an environmental problem. It is of course also a very real threat to Australian jobs. You only have to visit a timber mill in the nation to see that people are perilously aware of the threat that can be posed by imports of illegal and unsustainable logging. To that end, the government is continuing to negotiate internationally to have methods of verification of and certification for timber in order to be able to ultimately prevent illegally logged timber from entering Australia. You need not only to be able to verify and certify what has been logged legally, which is the reason we have our agreements with both Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, but also to be able to have a level of cooperation where the processing itself occurs, which is why we have been having further discussions on that with China.The question from the member for Wills also invites me to provide examples of where some appalling logging practices have taken place. I am reminded of the example of Axiom Forest Resources, a company that engaged in logging in the Solomon Islands in the 1990s, at the same time that the Leader of the Opposition was both its chairman and a shareholder. I read with interest an article earlier this year in the Sunday Telegraph. The title of the article is: 'Malcolm Turnbull linked to mass logging operation in Solomon Islands'. It went on to report about the island of Vangunu, home to just over 2,000 people in the Solomons. The Leader of the Opposition's company certainly left its mark on the island; it was never the same. A report provided by AusAID said:_ more like a clear-felling operation and bearing little relation to an attempt at even retaining a token sample of future commercial crop on the site.Further:The degree of canopy removal and soil disturbance was the most extensive seen by the authors in any logging operation in tropical rainforest in any country _The impact from the destruction of the resource was such that, instead of it being done in a sustainable way, the resource was essentially shot to pieces and that then had an ongoing impact on the soil. When rain went through, the water would take in the order of 24 hours to a week to clear and, in the rainy season, the plumes became a semi-permanent feature.It was also revealed in March 2007 that the chairman of that company bought in at $200,000 and sold out one year later for $25 million. That is not a bad story for the Leader of the Opposition but a pretty shocking story for the residents of that island in the Solomon Islands. In a 1997 report into logging practices in the Solomon Islands, it was also revealed that complex corporate arrangements where consistently entered into to avoid tax. This is something that would be known fairly well by someone who has been willing to be an opportunist in this way - an opportunist who was also willing, as the minister for the environment, to describe rainforests as 'the lungs of the world' some years after he had decided to be part of an operation that was clear-felling the lungs of the world. - We have the Manager of Opposition Business wanting to talk about 'Where is there a smear? Where is it grubby?' I tell you that it certainly was for the people living in the Solomons; it certainly was for them. They certainly had a resource shot to pieces. They certainly had to deal with something. What was the role, as the chairman of the company, that the Leader of the Opposition when this came to light described himself as having:My only involvement with the company was as a corporate doctor.Well, a doctor that may well have made the company pretty healthy but left the Solomons feeling pretty sick. The people of this former island paradise do not thank the Leader of the Opposition, the doctor, for his prescription. They live with it every day. They live with the cash grab. They live with the resource destruction of a first-grade political opportunist - someone who might be willing to cover Australian farmland with trees while he is clear-felling the islands of the Pacific.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The first part of the answer to the honourable member's question is: no, I am not aware of that exchange. Secondly, as I listened carefully to the honourable member's question it referred to contact between Mission Australia and the minister's office. I would have thought that such contact was a normal matter of discourse between a minister's office and an organisation like Mission Australia. As I said, I am unaware of the actual transaction which the honourable member refers to, but can I just say more broadly about the government's engagement with Mission Australia that we are dealing with Mission Australia all the time on questions of local jobs initiatives and on providing services to the homeless. I would regard this as being a normal exchange. I wait for further information on which I could base a further reply.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Dobell for his question. The global recession is a very serious threat to the Australian economy and to jobs in Australia. Around the world, economic activity, trade, jobs, credit provision and government finances have been plummeting as a result of the global recession and that is inevitably impacting directly on the Australian economy through lower mineral prices, changes in the terms of trade, less investment and lower confidence in the Australian economy, and therefore it constitutes an enormous threat to jobs in the Australian economy.That is why the government has responded through bank guarantees, through stimulus packages and through longer-term investment in infrastructure - all directed towards sustaining activity and jobs in the Australian economy. I have to confess that none of that is really much news to most Australians because people have been seeing it night after night on their TV screens. Most people are well aware of the fact that the global recession constitutes an enormous threat to jobs in the Australian economy. It is not a secret for most Australians but it does appear that it is something of a secret to at least one group of Australians - namely, the Liberal Party and the National Party opposition, because they do not appear to be fully aware of the threat that the global recession is posing to the Australian economy.Like many other members of the House, I do not get a huge amount of leisure time up in Canberra. It is one of those circumstances where you do not get much chance to relax, but every now and then I manage to chill out a bit and have a cup of coffee or something like that. I admit it: I do that every now and then. Yesterday was one of those occasions when I managed to get an opportunity to relax for a bit, and I stumbled across a Liberal Party leaflet and had a bit of a read of it.I admit that some people could suggest that this behaviour is a little odd - that for entertainment and leisure I am reading Liberal Party leaflets - but I plead guilty. They are pretty exciting! They are pretty interesting things! It is a very interesting leaflet. It is headed Recovery for Australia. It has a nice picture of the Leader of the Opposition on it and it has a little survey that asks you questions like what you think are the most important things in the budget, including paying back 'borrowed debt'. Borrowed debt! They make sure that you get the message about what kind of debt it is.There is an interesting thing about this leaflet and that is that all the way through there is not a single mention of the global recession. There is not one mention of the global recession, not one mention of the global financial crisis battering the Australian economy, not one mention of the collapse in government revenue that has flowed from the global recession, not one mention of the change in the terms of trade and not one mention to people of the massive threat to jobs that is constituted by the global recession.Sometimes some Australians claim that politicians are out of touch. This Liberal leaflet is exhibit A in the case for the prosecution of politicians for being out of touch, because those in the Liberal Party are just like their forebears in the 1930s - those characters with the bowler hats, the waist coasts and the canes and all that sort of stuff. You can just see the Leader of the Opposition being exactly the same - totally uncaring, totally unconcerned about jobs and in complete denial about the threat of the global recession - and in that case the threat of global depression to jobs. He is in complete denial, just like many of his colleagues are in complete denial about climate change. There are places you can go to get help for this problem of denial and I would recommend to the Leader of the Opposition that he might try that. You sit around in a circle and then you pop up and say, 'I'm Malcolm and I'm an investment banker.' And then everybody gets together and has a chat about it all.The problem for the Australian community is that the Liberal Party today is exactly the same as the outfit in the 1930s - completely unconcerned about jobs, completely unconcerned about the impact on the small businesses of Australia of the collapse of economic activity around the world and its impact on the Australian economy. Well, the government does care about jobs in this country. The government does care about economic activity and livelihoods of businesses in this country. And that is why, like so many other governments around the world, we are acting decisively to stimulate economic activity in order to sustain jobs and sustain business activity in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I refer the honourable member to the answer to his earlier question. I would draw his specific attention to the points that I raised there, and if he has any further information to raise with the House then of course we will look at it. Can I just say to the honourable member: the government has a strong relationship with the community sector and with community sector organisations like Mission Australia, who do a first-class job. Secondly -  - Again I refer the honourable member's attention to the answers I gave to the two earlier questions. On the question of Mission Australia, can I say the government has a good relationship with Mission Australia. They do an excellent job in the community on jobs and on homelessness. We work with them all the time. I always find it passing strange when those opposite stand up at the dispatch box and make statements like this without any point of reflection on their own engagement in something to do with the dispensing of projects to various National Party electorates in previous times, which is the subject of two Auditor-General's reports. I would suggest they reflect on that further.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. I notice the interjection from the Leader of the National Party that renewable energy equals people losing their jobs. That is exactly what he interjected, and I would have it placed on the parliamentary record. Can I just say to the honourable member that, if that is his attitude to the future of solar, if that is his attitude to the future of wind, if that is his attitude to the future of tidal and wave and if that is his attitude to the future of the rest of the renewable energy sector, then it says everything about why in this House for the last three weeks we have not got a single question on climate change - not a single question on renewable energy, not a single question on the CPRS. Do we know why that is the case? Because those opposite are terminally divided on this question.As I said yesterday in the House, on the CPRS report which came out of the Senate on the future of climate change, we had the Liberals dividing against the Liberals. Then, of course, on the renewable energy target, we had the Nationals dividing against the Liberals. Then, of course, some of the Nationals divided against other Nationals and some of the Nationals divided against some of the Liberals.Can I just say to those opposite that these matters before the Senate now equal the future of Australian industry and the future of Australian jobs. The honourable member mounted a campaign against his predecessor on the fact that he was going to be greener and cleaner than the member for Bradfield - I think that was the case: greener and cleaner. Brendan nods that that was the case: that was the campaign launched against the member for Bradfield. I have always said about the member for Bradfield: he always stood for what he believed in, as opposed to certain other members who have replaced him.Notwithstanding having rolled the member for Bradfield as the Leader of the Opposition on a clean, green approach to climate change, one which has singularly unified all members sitting opposite, we have of course the Climate Institute providing us with advice in their 2009 study about the employment impacts from wind, solar and bioenergy. That analysis shows that the implementation of clean energy projects across Australia would result in some 26,000 new jobs. Furthermore, what it says is that 2½ thousand new ongoing positions would occur in power stations and there would be 15,000 construction jobs and 8,600 indirect jobs in supporting sectors.But this is where it gets interesting in terms of where the jobs are concentrated. The report advises us that it will be focused in regional centres such as Wollongong - I am sure the member for Cunningham would be pleased about that. Yass - I am not sure whether the member for Hume would welcome additional jobs in Yass. Alby? Wagga Wagga - where does the member for Riverina stand in terms of new jobs in Wagga Wagga? I would suggest she reads this report as well. Cooma and Bega - I know for a fact that the member for Eden-Monaro would be supporting extra jobs in his electorate. Scottsdale in Tasmania - I think the member for Bass supports jobs in her area. Portland in Victoria - I am sure the member will be supporting jobs there. Port Augusta in South Australia - what about the member for Grey? Where does the member for Grey stand on extra jobs in their area? And Albany in the west, where the good old member for O'Connor comes from - the good old member for O'Connor, who is now up and running as the next candidate for the leadership of the opposition, out there, I am sure, supporting renewable energy jobs in his electorate.If we are going to act on climate change, a couple of things are necessary. We need to get a CPRS through the Senate. The Liberal Party and National parties are so divided they do not know what to do about it. We need to get renewable energy targets through the Senate - the Liberal Party and National parties are so divided they do not know what to do about it. - But can I just say to the ever-interjecting member for - A government member - Flinders. - Flinders - thank you. I was going to say something else, but I will not - that the future of rebates for people wanting to buy solar panels in the future depends on the passage of the renewable energy target legislation -  - The member for Flinders again objects very loudly, as he is often given to do. The member for Flinders, a bit like the member for Curtin, has had ample opportunity to ask questions on a particular matter but they never seem to come. We have been having a debate about solar panels for how many days now? Quite a while. We have been having a debate about the CPRS for a few weeks and nothing seems to be coming.Why is it, member for Flinders, that the 26-member strong opposition tactics committee has not given you a single question yet on solar rebates? Not one! Why has the member for Flinders been neutered on this question? We may ask: why has he been neutered on this question? There is a reason: because they are terminally divided on what to do on the RET. This is where the rubber really hits the road. The future of working families' ability to get renewable energy certificates, to get a discount on future solar panels, depends on whether the Liberals and Nationals will block legislation in the Senate on the renewable energy target. It is as simple as that. That is the bottom line. Therefore, they are being consistent with what they have done in the past - blocked the CPRS; blocked the Australian Business Investment Partnership; threatened to block the renewable energy target, as the Nationals indicated yesterday - in this permanent cycle of negativity.But put politics to one side - jobs are at stake here. The ability of working families to get a discount for their solar panels is at stake here as well. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who is now freed of the spectre of the member for Higgins behind him taking over the leadership of the Liberal Party: it is time for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up and be counted. Pass the CPRS legislation. Pass the renewable energy target legislation. And, on the way through, give the member for Flinders a question so he can ask one in the House.</DOC>

 - Of course I will look at the matter raised by the member for Sturt, but I will make the caveat that, in terms of questions raised by him and members opposite in this House, we are yet to see any of the facts being right. The facts are never as they are represented by them in this parliament. So I will check that.But what I will say to the member for Sturt, and what he may not realise - he obviously does not know much about this program, because of the continued misrepresentations he makes in relation to it - is that the expenditure on this program is calibrated so buildings are constructed and there is the fit-out of them so that they are fit-for-purpose. I actually explained this to the member yesterday, during the MPI. He was wandering around a bit, so he may have missed this part of the explanation: when you are comparing quotes, it is very important that you are comparing them for the same purpose. - Many of the quotes that have been used in the public debate around this have been the sort of per-metre construction quotes you get if you are putting up the building but not fitting it out. As I remarked during the MPI yesterday, and as anybody would know who has been a builder of a new home, or perhaps has done a renovation of their own home, there is a difference between the costs of the lock-up stage and it being completely fitted out. For example, if you were constructing a kitchen to lock-up stage, you would get a particular quote per metre. If you were doing all of the fit-out - the sinks and the electrics that would go with it -  - I was asked about building costs at a specific school, and I am explaining the way the Building the Education Revolution program works, for the member to try and understand so he can stop the cycle of coming into this parliament and misrepresenting this program for base political advantage - while he refuses, of course, to generate anything that looks like an education policy for the opposition. So the simple point to the member for Sturt is: I will look at what he has raised, but the Building the Education Revolution program includes the cost of the building being fit-for-purpose, so it will include the cost of things like interactive whiteboards, seating, sound systems in halls and the like. Consequently, when you look at those, they are built into the project costs and we will see whether or not the shadow minister is really making an appropriate comparison with those figures.But what I can also say to the member for Sturt, given he has asked me about Building the Education Revolution program - and this will be a matter that interests him a great deal I think - is that I have had a look today at the words in the East Torrens Messenger, a local newspaper in the member for Sturt's electorate. - He is yelling out, 'A very good newspaper'. Well, I am glad he is of that view, because the East Torrens Messenger today records the words of Cathie Wilson, the principal of the Stradbroke school -  - The shadow minister is agreeing with me that she is a very good principal, so I hope that he is going to agree -  - A very good supporter of the shadow minister, and a woman whose counsel he should take, said the following with respect to the money coming to her school:This is the first time we've had a new building at the school in 30 years. The kids are thrilled. They've been asking for a larger gym for a long time, because we can't fit the whole school into our current one.That is a quote from a woman the shadow minister says he respects, who is a very good principal, who is a supporter of his - and what does that very good principal and woman he respects say? She says the Building the Education Revolution program is making such a difference for her school that the kids are 'thrilled'.But that is not the end of the words of wisdom in the East Torrens Messenger today, because the East Torrens Messenger today also contains an article headed 'Funding gets a gold star'. It is referring to the Building the Education Revolution programs at Burnside Primary School. The principal of Burnside Primary School, Frank Mittiga, says, 'This is something that will go a long way to supporting children in reception to year 5.'I say to the member for Sturt, if he would just stop giggling and squealing for one moment and think what his role is in this parliament, his role in this parliament is to come to it and represent the views of the community in Sturt. Through his own local newspaper today, the community in Sturt is speaking loudly to him about their support for Building the Education Revolution. The only thing I hope is that on his return to his electorate the member for Sturt has got the guts to go to the Stradbroke School and to the Burnside Primary School and look both principals in the eye -  - Well, he can go back to it and have the guts to look the principal in the eye and say: 'If I had my way you would not get one cent. If I had my way not one child in this school would benefit from Building the Education Revolution.' I suggest to the member that if he has got the guts to do that, between giggling and squealing, he should then come back to this parliament and report on exactly how those conversations went.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for the question. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is the most significant environmental reform that has been attempted in this country. It is the means by which we as a nation can reduce our carbon pollution and achieve the targets that the government has set out by 2020. It is such a significant environmental and economic reform that many, particularly in the business community, have called for a bipartisan approach to this issue to deliver a greater investment certainty environment for business. And yet what the government has encountered is nothing but obstruction by the opposition. The fact is that the biggest barrier at this point in time to the passage of this important environmental reform is the coalition. Importantly, we know that the Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the coalition, has made a number of important statements. It appears from that commentary that it is accepted by the coalition that action on climate change is necessary. From the comments made it also appears that the coalition supports the government's targets for reducing emissions. And there has been a recognition by the Leader of the Opposition that there will be an emissions trading scheme in Australia at some point in time. These are important comments that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the coalition.It is therefore a legitimate question to ask: why has there been nothing but opposition and nothing constructive put forward by the coalition? All that we have seen are excuses for the delay. The underlying reason for this position, it is clear, is the division in the opposition ranks over this important issue and that, as we approach the debate in the Senate over the CPRS, is what is holding up such a fundamental environmental reform. We know that the coalition is peppered with climate change sceptics and others who are simply opposed to any action on this issue. Senator Bernardi, a member of the coalition, is on the record as saying that humans are not even responsible for climate change. Senator Abetz apparently believes that weeds are a greater threat than climate change. The National Party, as stated repeatedly by Senator Joyce, is flatly opposed to emissions trading.Further evidence of the division amongst the opposition is contained in the report released this week of the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy, which is chaired by the coalition. Paragraph 2.36 of that report states:The balance of the evidence discussed above suggests that climate change is occurring, is driven by anthropogenic factors and is a grave threat to accustomed ways of life and natural systems. If this view is right, the calculations above make a virtually unarguable case for taking global action.But Senator Cash of the coalition issued a minority report choosing to differ. It stated the following:I do not believe that this properly reflects the balance of evidence in terms of the science of climate change.This is just further evidence of the division in the coalition over this important issue that is frustrating the passage of such a significant environmental reform. The fact is that with the CPRS due to be debated shortly in the Senate it is time for the coalition to take responsibility and to act in the interests of the Australian people in dealing with climate change. The coalition needs to support action on climate change. It is time to put aside the excuses for delay. It is time to listen to the business community, which wants investment certainty and which is arguing for the passage of this legislation. It is time to put positive suggestions forward and not excuses. It is time for the coalition to support the CPRS. It is time for the coalition to support the government's renewable energy legislation and to do what the Leader of the Opposition knows is right for this country: to take action on climate change and pass this important legislation as soon as possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, which is a more responsible one than we are used to from the opposition. What I can say to the member is that, of course, if there is a concern by a school in his local community that he wants addressed then I am very happy to assist him with that. We have assisted many members of the opposition, in fact, who have come and raised individual issues, and I am happy to do that. Of course, we will work through the issues with him that are raised and assess the views of the school community.What we have always been very clear about with the Building the Education Revolution process and guidelines is that consultation does need to occur with school communities so that school communities can work their way through whether their preference is for a multipurpose hall or a library or whether their preference is for classroom refurbishments, and obviously they then work through project questions and issues. I am very happy to work with him on the Langwarrin Primary School. I understand that the primary school has been approved for $200,000 of National School Pride funding, and I do not understand the member to be raising any issues in relation to that. That is going for an undercover learning area, which I am sure the school is very excited about getting. The school has been approved for $3 million of funding under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program for the construction of a new library. If there is an issue about that new library that the member would like to pursue with me, I am very happy to help.</DOC>

 - I certainly thank my colleague, who is a fine representative of the Geelong region, for that question. He along, with the member for Lalor, the member for Bendigo, the member for Ballarat, the member for Gellibrand and others, particularly in western Melbourne, have welcomed the government's commitment to public transport investment.Today, along with the Victorian Minister for Public Transport, I have announced that up to six new stations will be built as part of the $4.3 billion Regional Rail Express. In addition to the construction of stations at Manor Lakes in Wyndham Vale and Rose Grange in Tarneit, land has also been put aside for station development at Dohertys Road in Truganina, Davis Road in Tarneit, Sewells Road in Tarneit and Black Forest Road in West Werribee. The full construction is scheduled to start next year - construction which will support literally thousands of jobs. Through our nation building for recovery plan we are investing today in the infrastructure that we need for tomorrow. This is all part of our sweeping investment in rail. We are investing more in the next 12 months than the previous government did in 12 long years.This has been well received by people in the infrastructure sector. Brendan Lyon, Executive Director of the peak organisation Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, has said this:Urban rail has been neglected for too long.                         _                   _                   _This Budget marks the first time that a Commonwealth Government has recognised the importance of public transport to the mobility, liveability and productivity of Australia's cities.Don Henry from the ACF has said:_ $4.6 billion for urban public transport will be good for the planet, good for cities and good for jobs.The Rudd government understands that a competitive, safe and reliable rail network is critical to lifting national productivity, critical to curbing the escalating cost of traffic congestion, and an important component of our whole-of-government approach to tackling climate change.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The one thing I can say to him - and I want to assure every member of the House of this, and I think it is an important point - is: I am certainly not writing the curriculum and it is not my intention at any stage to intervene in the process of the development of the national curriculum. I know that the approach of the former government was to play these issues out for grand public debate in the hope that they could get some political advantage in relation to them. But the important thing out of all of the curriculum wars and history wars engaged in by the Howard government, after acres and acres of newsprint, is that they never managed to get a national curriculum in this country.We are substituting that track record of failure with a successful process to deliver a national curriculum. I am very happy to say to the member that if he would like to talk to the head of the National Curriculum Board, Barry McGaw, we can facilitate that. I can also say to the member - and he has probably seen this through the history framing papers, through the consultations that have gone on in history; the same sorts of consultations that happened in English and other things - that Barry McGaw has been very consultative and very clear that teaching the history of Australia will be a narrative of the principal events, obviously including World War II and all of the significant conflicts and engagements of this country.He has been interviewed extensively and that sort of framework for the curriculum is clear. The framing papers and discussions to date have received a lot of positive feedback. We want Australian students to get a feel for every part of the history of this nation and - obviously, as students progress through school - to get a deeper and deeper understanding of events. I am very happy for the member to talk to Barry McGaw. I am very happy to forward him all of the documents that have been made available publicly. I think he will find in those documents that it is very clear that all significant events, including World War II, will be covered in the history curriculum.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Throsby. I know she has had a very long history of interest, involvement and activism in this area. There is no-one in this House, I am sure, who underestimates the seriousness of the crime we are talking about today or dismisses the criminality of the people involved, whether that trafficking is for the purposes of sexual servitude or labour exploitation. Today the government announced changes to the support provided to victims of trafficking that will provide greater support to more victims of trafficking and support efforts to prosecute those who have trafficked these people. This issue crosses portfolios, and I want to acknowledge and thank my colleagues the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the parliamentary secretary. I want to pay particular tribute to the previous Minister for Home Affairs for his efforts in setting up the roundtable on people trafficking, which has resulted in so much good work and so many good outcomes over the last year in this area.Today's efforts will simplify the visa framework as it applies to people who have been trafficked. It will provide greater support to more victims of trafficking and support efforts to prosecute perpetrators of the crime. All victims will now be able to access support, irrespective of their current visa status. The immediate period of support will be extended from 30 days to 45 days and provided to all victims of people trafficking. We will also provide 90 days of support for victims who are willing to assist police but may be too traumatised to do so. There are a number of other changes as well. I recently appointed the Red Cross to manage the support program for victims of people trafficking, and I was very pleased with that appointment. The Red Cross have international and Australian experience in supporting very traumatised people, including refugees and asylum seekers, and are a very appropriate organisation to provide this support to very vulnerable and distressed people.Today's announcement has been widely welcomed and supported by individuals and organisations that have campaigned in this area. Professor Jennifer Burn, the Director of the University of Technology's Anti-Slavery Project, said:This amendment is in accordance with international best practice. These amendments will make an enormous difference to our clients.Nina Vallins, the Coordinator of Project Respect, said:Project Respect welcomes the changes announced by the government today, which will significantly advance the rights and protection of victims of trafficking in Australia. These changes will make Australia a world leader in this area.Sister Stancea Vichie, the Chair of Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans, said:The announcements made by the government today will enhance the protection and support for all people who have been trafficked into Australia.The President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Catherine Branson, and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Liz Broderick, praised the changes as humanitarian and compassionate improvements which will help people recover from appalling violations of their basic human rights. These changes are a very important measure to help victims of trafficking recover from the trauma of this horrific crime. At the same time as our treatment of victims becomes more flexible and compassionate, our resolve to prosecute the perpetrators of this dreadful crime is undiminished. I am sure that all members of this House agree that this crime must be prevented in Australia and around the world and that those who profit from it should bear the full force of the criminal law.</DOC>

 - I am happy to discuss the circumstances of that individual school with the member. I must admit I did not even quite catch the name of the school. - Beechmont. I think the member would be aware that he is an example of a member in this House who has from time to time raised issues about our Building the Education Revolution Program and we have responded. When he has asked us about individual matters, we have responded in a way that has met with his approval. Despite the fact that the opposition opposed the program holus-bolus, we have worked with individual opposition members - including the member who raises the question.What I want to explain to the honourable member in response to the question about tenders and costs - and I explained some things earlier in my answer to the member for Sturt - is the way the estimates end up being refined into project costs. It may depend at what stage of the process he has got the figure from. It may be from an early stage of the process and there has been some refinement of the costs. In Building the Education Revolution program initial estimates of costs are provided to the Commonwealth and they are based on the extensive experience of state and territory and block grant education authorities, and funding is approved based on those estimates. The people who run schools give us estimates that in their experience have proven to be correct estimates of costs. Then tenders are sought for managing contractors, who will then hire subcontractors in local areas to undertake the work. They may project manage a number of projects across a region. Quotes or tenders are then sought for individual projects. In many cases, design and construction contracts are being used to fast-track the process. This means that the builder works with the design team, architects and engineers on the job.Quotes will include some money allocated for contingencies, which may be things like unforeseen problems with the site or excavation problems. When quotes are finalised, schools may find they have funding available to do more than was originally envisaged. They can then seek an agreement for a project variation from the Commonwealth if what is planned was not within the scope of the original approved project. When buildings are progressed to a certain point and all concerns about contingencies have been addressed, decisions will then be made with school principals about how the contingency amount can be used either to enhance the existing approved project, or projects, or to add a second project if there was only one initial project approved.I think the member can see from that process that, in relation to the original cost estimates, we are relying on the historic experience of those who run schools, state and territory governments, and the block grant authorities in the Catholic and independent school system. Then we go through a tender process, which obviously refines costs. Then we go through a project delivery process, where of course some money is kept in reserve for contingencies because when you are building things, as people would know from home renovations and residential construction, you can hit contingencies. Then when you come to the actual costs, if there is a project variation, there is a way of dealing with the approval of that. If at the final stage you have money left over then we can enter into an agreement with the school as to the use of the money that is left over.This is a considered and thoughtful process that has checks and balances at every stage. I accept that the member -  - I have provided that comprehensive information because I know from my dealings with the member about the Building the Education Revolution program - notwithstanding the fact that he voted against it - that he is involved in helping his local schools. I have responded to it on the basis that it is an honest question.I understand that the tag line is part of the political campaign of the shadow minister for education, the member for Sturt, to besmirch this program. He might choose to do that, but the reality is - and members know it as they move around their local communities - that this is being seized by schools as an opportunity to deliver the infrastructure they need for tomorrow and it is being seized by local communities to deliver jobs today. Responsible members of the House know that and are responding to that. Unfortunately, those who squeal, wail and moan sitting on the opposition side here do not acknowledge that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for his question. The threat of electronic security incidents was outlined recently in a report of the Australian Institute of Criminology entitled Australian business assessment of computer user security. It estimated that business sustained losses in the order of $595 million up to $649 million as a result of electronic security threats. The government believes that these identified threats are probably only the tip of the iceberg. The Prime Minister indicated in his National Security Statement last year that electronic security is indeed now a national security priority.Obviously, it is in the interests of the broader community and the economy for there to be complete faith and confidence in the viability of commercial transactions undertaken over the internet. That is why in the last budget we committed some $8.8 million in additional funding to initiatives in the civil area, as opposed to the defence area with high-end technologies, to deal with the threats posed by electronic security incidents. In particular, we have established a new computer emergency response team to act as the single point of contact for businesses, homes and schools to identify threats and vulnerabilities and of course to communicate information about strategies to protect electronic systems. This is in addition to the initiatives announced in the defence white paper to establish the Cyber Security Operations Centre. That centre will be staffed by representatives of the Australian Defence Force, my department and the Australian Federal Police. It will be a 24-hour, seven-day-a week watch centre. That watch centre will be able to provide better situational awareness of what is happening broadly on the internet and achieve better coordination.These initiatives build on activities that are already occurring. For instance, my department has provided briefings on electronic attack threats to some 460 companies. There is a regular exchange of information through the Trusted Information Sharing Network and the Australian Federal Police have developed sophisticated investigation techniques to identify and prosecute those engaged in electronic security incidents. Also, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy engages in a number of programs to promote electronic security awareness to homes, small businesses and schools. Indeed, on a related topic I note that the Deputy Prime Minister indicated last week an outstanding program to address cyberbullying in schools.In summary, the government takes threats to electronic security very seriously. We are adopting a holistic approach to ensuring online security for the government, for critical infrastructure and for the broader community. Any member of the community, whether they be in a business, a school or a home, who has concerns about this area should refer to my department's website for details of relevant contacts, who will be able to provide assistance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have not seen the detail of President Obama's statement overnight and will be studying that in the period ahead. Can I say to the honourable member, however, that the President of the United States and I, in Washington and subsequently at the G20 summit in London, discussed on many occasions how we, as a G20, reform global financial markets and global financial systems and the regulatory environment which underpins them because, as the honourable member would know, in particular, given his professional background, global capital is globally mobile and therefore the regulations that we need for the future need to be consistent across multiple nations, across multiple jurisdictions. Therefore that is why an extensive raft of reform proposals have been put to the Financial Stability Forum, as it was before - now the Financial Stability Board - that is headed by the Governor of the Central Bank of Italy, Governor Draghi.Australia is represented on the Financial Stability Board and has recently had its representation enhanced from one position to two positions. As a consequence, through our representation on the Financial Stability Board, we will be working through with our colleagues from the G20, which now has a membership which parallels that of the Financial Stability Board, a raft of reform proposals which go to the questions of executive remuneration and financial markets as well as the proper provisioning for risk, the proper provisioning for capital adequacy and the proper provisioning for a whole range of other protections in financial markets. I would also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that the reason that we found ourselves in this extraordinary crisis - starting with the events of late last year and commencing in the United States much earlier than that - was that we had an outbreak of free-market fundamentalism in the United States with grossly unregulated markets and as a consequence of that we had the spread of this contagion across the world. - I would have thought this answer is quite relevant to the question I have been asked. - Mr Speaker, as I said yesterday, me thinks he doth protest too much. The fountain of negativity on the Australian economy, the Leader of the Opposition, will not pass an hour or a day, in this place or beyond, without taking the opportunity to talk down the Australian economy, to talk negatively about what is going on, to seize any piece of data and to twist it in order to convey a negative narrative against the Australian economy. I say to the honourable member: why doesn't he stand with the parliament and with the nation at large and celebrate the fact that Australia is now the fastest-growing economy of all the major advanced economies? Why does he not stand at the dispatch box and celebrate the fact that we have the second lowest unemployment rate among the major advanced economies? Why does he not stand at the dispatch box and celebrate the fact that we have the lowest net debt of the major advanced economies? - Mr Speaker, the point of order from the Leader of the Opposition was about speaking positively about the Australian economy. Therefore, it is a question of growth, it is a question about unemployment and it is a question about net debt relative to the rest of the other economies around the world. It is also a question in terms of government deficit relative to the other major advanced economies and to the fact that this economy, virtually uniquely across the OECD, has managed thus far to avoid a recession. I would have thought that, in terms of speaking positively about the Australian economy, this is where the nation - consumers across the nation, businesses across the nation - want us to be, reflected by the two confidence indicators recently indicating that Australians want us as a government, as a nation and as a parliament to be as one, pull together and push the Australian economy up, lifting it up out of global recession. - In terms of the question about financial markets, as the honourable member was asking before: that is why the government, given the dramatic circumstances of last October -  -  - I would have thought the honourable member might be interested in this response. The government response to the events of last October, following the implosion of Lehman, 'Black Friday' on stock markets and the grave crisis we faced in this country as a consequence of that, included actions to provide guarantees for depositors right across the country for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth. He asks a question as to what was missing in terms of the regulatory environment when this government was elected to office. Where was a deposit insurance scheme on the part of those opposite? When the Liberal Party occupied the treasury bench, how many times was a deposit insurance scheme recommended - one, two, three, four, five times? The reason they did not is that the banking industry got into their ear and said it was too expensive; they did not want to do it. As a consequence, we actually found ourselves on the cusp of this crisis in September and October last year without adequate consumer protection for depositors across the country. That is why the government had to act.The honourable member asked what actions we have taken to improve financial regulation in this country. I would think that the 13 million or so deposit holders across the country, all the men and women in the gallery here today and those listening to the broadcast who have deposits in banks, building societies and credit unions will be pleased by the fact that a government at last acted to provide that level of security to the Australian financial system. That is one element of our actions.We have also sought to undertake other actions, which have been frustrated by the member opposite, including the proper provision of financial support for the commercial property sector in Australia. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: as he looks at the number of firms out there in the construction industry with jobs at risk of being lost through the nonsupply of capital, he should ask himself the question of why he has acted so negatively and destructively to undermine the Australian Business Investment Partnership. It was supported by the Property Council and supported by business groups across the country. At this time of crisis in financial markets, we needed a special form of market intervention of the type which is put together with the private sector. Of course, this was blocked and voted down by those in the Senate. - Firstly, the government acted nationally through the measures I have just referred to - providing guarantees for deposit holders, providing guarantees for interbank lending and proposed interventions of the type described in the Australian Business Investment Partnership. Secondly, and critically, the government acted multilaterally through the G20 and through the raft of reforms to financial markets which are currently being considered by the Financial Stability Board. Australia is actively engaged in all of this. I would have thought the honourable member would understand that capital is globally mobile, and for there to be an effective regulatory environment you need a global set of regulations to underpin it. The member asked what actions we are taking - we are active on this range of fronts and we will continue to be active on them into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Calwell for her question. The government is committed to ensuring 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply is generated from renewable energy by 2020. That is why we have established a renewable energy target and introduced legislation in this parliament to that effect. The House of Representatives has passed that legislation and it is now in the Senate - but I will come back to that in a moment. The reason we have done so is not just to make our contribution to bring down global greenhouse gas emissions but, on top of that, to ensure that there are new jobs generated in the renewable energy sector in Australia.If we raised to 20 per cent the proportion of Australia's electricity supply coming from the renewable energy sector by 2020, I am advised that would be equivalent to the electricity used in Australia's 7½ million households. The equivalent of the electricity used in 7½ million households would be supplied by renewable energy. This is important for the environment but it is equally important for Australian jobs. Treasury modelling projects that by 2050 the renewable energy sector will be 30 times larger than it is today. Solar, wind and geothermal technologies all represent further opportunities for jobs for Australia - good for jobs and good for the environment.This comes to the whole question of why we are acting on climate change through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the renewable energy target legislation, in addition to a range of other measures to support investment in this critical sector in renewable energy. The reason is that the economic cost of inaction is far greater than the economic cost of action. The Garnaut review projected declines in the value of agricultural production of up to 97 per cent in the Murray-Darling by the end of the century if emissions are not reduced, as well as projecting the catastrophic destruction of the Great Barrier Reef.At present the Great Barrier Reef generates some $4.9 billion in revenue, as the member for Leichhardt well knows, and it generates employment for about 60,000 people across Australia. The agricultural sector in the Murray-Darling Basin, as members opposite whose seats are adjacent to that region would know, employs some 90,000 people. On these two questions - that is, the impact on the Great Barrier Reef alone and the impact on the Murray-Darling - you are looking at an aggregate employment impact or effect on those 150,000 Australians employed through tourism on the Great Barrier Reef and agriculture in the Murray-Darling. That is why Australia must act.That is also why the Australian business community wants certainty for its regulations for the future. If you are a business out there in the renewable energy sector or in the traditional energy sector, you want certainty in the regulatory environment. That is what we are on about. Pacific Hydro, for example, have some 600 megawatts of clean energy projects in the pipeline in Australia worth $2 billion. Let me quote from Mr Rob Grant, CEO of Pacific Hydro, who said in March this year -  - The member for Flinders speaks about delays in legislation, delays in climate change legislation. - How many reports did the previous government receive on the need for (a) an emissions trading scheme and (b) halving the renewable energy target? I have lost count. Year in year out the reports came in over the 12 years that they were in office, but our hyperactive member for Flinders obviously prevailed so decisively in the internal deliberations of the Howard government that what was produced by legislative outcome was one big fat zero. In 18 months this government has framed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation, which is now in the Senate, and renewable energy target legislation, which is now in the Senate as well. -  - I begin to hear interjections on climate change. -  - I will come to the question of Senate filibusters in a minute, Mr Speaker, but to quote further from Pacific Hydro - and I note the opposition's continued sensitivity on the whole raft of climate change matters which are before the parliament at the moment - Mr Rob Grant said:Pacific Hydro's investment alone will create thousands of jobs mainly in regional areas in areas such as road building, concreting, steel fixing and steel fabrication.And he went on to say:_ we must legislate the RET - the renewable energy target - as quickly as possible to create new jobs and limit the impact of the global economic crisis.That is what Pacific Hydro had to say.But that is where we get to the position of obstruction on the part of the opposition. What we see from those opposite at present is a decision today by the opposition to delay the passage of the renewable energy target legislation. I refer to the Sydney Morning Herald and an article there which brings to our attention the intention of Mr Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, to direct his Senate colleagues to filibuster next week to prevent a vote on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Not having the courage to vote for climate change is one thing, but not having the courage to allow any vote on climate change is something else. In fact, on this critical challenge of climate change for Australia, I would say that filibustering is not leadership, it is just absolute opportunism, and that is what we have on the part of those opposite.Remember that great senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond, an anti-integration senator from the south? I think he has the world record - 24 hours, I think - for filibustering. I say to those opposite: can you get on with the business of passing this legislation. The nation needs it.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. This is part of his debt scare campaign that he has been attempting to mount in this House day in day out. Of course he cannot ever quite get all his figures right or facts right. That does not seem to matter at all, because the opposition are not interested in an alternative economic policy; they are just interested in a scare campaign. They are not interested in supporting jobs; they are just interested in another scare campaign, which is where the question comes from today.I have had several questions about this from the shadow Treasurer over recent weeks. Basically, he has asked me what percentage of our bonds on issue is owned by people overseas. And the answer is: roughly two-thirds. That has not changed from the time of the former government. It was roughly two-thirds then and it is roughly two-thirds now.There were amendments attempted to be moved in this House last night. The opposition could not get them right - they stuffed that up - and they had to go up and move them in the Senate today. And of course those amendments did go through the Senate today. They are amendments seeking greater detail as to what or who may be the individual investors. At the moment the data that is provided by the Bureau of Statistics. It does not give the sort of detail that the member opposite is seeking so what we have said we will do reasonably is look at whether we can get, in an accurate fashion, more data. I made the offer to him in the House last night that we would sit down with our advisers, with the Treasury, and through the ABS, and attempt to do that. I made that clear, Mr Speaker.But, of course, it is not about that. What it is really about is this debt scare campaign. Australia has low levels of net debt compared to every other economy in the world - very low compared to every other major advanced economy. I think it pays to go through them. If we take the period to 2014 and go through levels of net debt around the world, they are: United Kingdom, 83 per cent; United States, 83 per cent. Major advanced -  - I will comply with the law of the land to the maximum extent that I possibly can. That is what I have said to -  -  - Mr Speaker, we really should have a look at how serious or childish those opposite are. Last night, with no warning, they turned up in the House with a couple of amendments that were inaccurate and had to be redrafted. They did not proceed with the amendments last night. They took them up into the Senate in a different form -  - Yes, Sloppy Joe - more 'sloppynomics' from Joe. They took them up in the Senate and they passed them, with the help of the minor parties, in the Senate today. Of course, we will comply to the maximum extent that we possibly can. But it is not about compliance. What it is about here is a debt scare campaign to try to get them off the hook for their failure to support economic stimulus, which is supporting jobs in this economy, and their embarrassment at the national account result two weeks ago. They have opposed vital economic stimulus which is supporting jobs in our economy, and all through this there is no alternative economic policy.The shadow Treasurer was on Sky News the other day. He was asked on Sky News how the coalition would get a lower deficit. This is the answer -  - Certainly, Mr Speaker, because I was asked a question about debt. The shadow Treasurer on Sky News was asked about how he would go about achieving a lower deficit which contributes to debt. So I do believe that my answer is directly relevant to the question that I have received from the shadow Treasurer. This is what he said on Sky News when he was asked by David Speers about how the coalition would have a lower deficit. He said this:There are always going to be other decisions, David, that we would have taken that would have not delivered the same budget deficit.He then goes on to say this:We said it was vitally important that you stimulate small business, and the way to do that, we said, was to change the superannuation guarantee arrangements.Those changes to the superannuation guarantee arrangements that they had mentioned some time ago come at a cost of $5 billion. So his answer on Sky News as to how he would go about getting a lower deficit was to add to the deficit. That is just more 'sloppynomics' from Sloppy Joe to camouflage the fact that they need to have a deficit and debt scare campaign because they have no positive alternative policy for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. Can I point out again to the House that the Rudd government is strongly committed to supporting renewable energy technologies, knowing that they will deliver clean energy jobs in the regions of Australia from now and into the future. This week we saw more evidence of the urgent need to address dangerous climate change and encourage investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency with the release of a very important report. This report, Global climate change impacts in the United States, was released by the White House and it represents a consensus of some 13 agencies on the potential impacts of climate change in the US. I saw Dr John Holdren, who is the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, speaking to this report on television recently. It makes compelling reading and listening. It observes that climate changes are already underway in the US and that thresholds for our climate and our ecosystems will be crossed. On the United States marine environment the report says:Coral reefs sustain fisheries and tourism, have biodiversity value, scientific and educational value, and form natural protection against wave erosion.The report goes on to say:The loss of income by 2015 from degraded reefs is conservatively estimated at several hundred million dollars annually.As the Prime Minister has just pointed out to the House, this is a risk the Australian government understands very well, with the Great Barrier Reef, our own coral reef system, providing over $4.9 billion in tourism revenues and employment for around 60,000 people. The US report says:_ choices made about emissions in the next few decades will have far-reaching consequences for climate change impacts.That is something that the Rudd government take very seriously, and so we are making positive choices: a commitment to a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a commitment to an expanded renewable energy target and solar credits which will provide up to $7,750 for a 1.5 kilowatt system for solar panels in some sections of Australia - in others not quite so much.We have chosen the policy position which will grow clean energy jobs - some 26,000 jobs recently identified by the Climate Institute, based on projects that are planned and committed. That is 26,000 clean energy jobs. But what do we see from the opposition today? We see the serial behaviour of delay - a decision to delay the passage of the renewable energy target, no commitment to renewable energy or to Australia's solar industry. I think it is extraordinary that the coalition cannot understand how important this is for Australian industry and for Australians. We have the potential to increase our renewable energy target some four times - solar energy, wind energy, wave energy - renewable energy of the future - and the coalition just simply will not go anywhere near supporting it.Perhaps we should not be so surprised about this, because they refused to increase the renewable energy target when they were in government and they refused to take up the recommendations of their own review. I was wondering why this was the case and, of course, I came to the member for Flinders. The member for Flinders said in parliament in November 2005 that the renewable energy target:_was always intended as a start-up scheme to get renewable energy underway in Australia._            _            _We set a target, we achieved it and now it is time for that industry to be able to produce and proceed on its own merits.So four years ago the coalition rolled out the 'mission accomplished banner' on renewable energy. They said it was all over. They said they did not want to increase the renewable energy target and they were prepared to leave Australia's fledging renewable energy industry on its own. Today, they have dusted the 'mission accomplished' banner. They have taken it out of the attic. They have pushed past the pink batts that the government is putting in the roofs of Australian homes to help them reduce their energy costs and their greenhouse gas emissions. The coalition have just confirmed again, with this serial behaviour, that they are not serious about climate change. It is all about delay. It is all about confusion. It is the same old coalition - walking away from renewable energy, walking away from clean energy jobs that thousands of Australians are ready to embrace and walking away from the investment possibilities that this industry can bring forward to give some economic sustainability to our economy. It is time the Leader of the Opposition showed some leadership on this issue.</DOC>

 - The government, since its election, has been committed to the education revolution. The government, since the stimulus strategy of February this year, is committed to building the education revolution through the single largest school modernisation program that this country has ever seen. As a consequence of that, we are out there working with state and territory governments rolling out projects in 7,500 primary schools across the nation. We are rolling out refurbishment programs for classrooms and other facilities within schools across all of Australia's 10,000 primary and secondary schools, government and non-government. On top of that, we have provided investment for new language centres and new science centres for at least 500 or so of Australia's 2,500 secondary schools. This is because we believe that the kids of today, who will become the leaders of tomorrow, deserve first-class facilities in which to learn - state-of-the-art libraries, state-of-the-art science centres and state-of-the-art language centres - and because we are interested in preparing our kids for the future.I notice that those opposite have a variable record on their degree of support for this program. I note in particular the levels of enthusiasm of various members representing the interests of their constituencies. I refer in particular to a recent communication by our good old friend the member for Macarthur to his constituents. I have here a little communication between -  - Here we have Pat - good to see you, mate! - who says in his local communication:I am working hard to ensure that more gets done for our community. Record levels of Australian Government funding are now going to our local schools, the literacy standards of our children have increased, as have the number of apprenticeships and there is significant Australian Government investment in our local hospitals _One thing about our colleagues opposite is that they are always on song! The member for Macarthur is reflecting the fact that all honourable members opposite - and also the members of the government - want to see this program being implemented on the ground. That is why, from the very beginning, the government issued these Building the Education Revolution guidelines. We have said from the beginning, when these guidelines were issued in February, that we would have proposals out there for projects under rounds 1 and 2 of the National School Pride and rounds 1 and 2 of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century to provide to the Commonwealth and to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to assess the eligibility of each proposal against the guidelines. Furthermore, the approval process is that the Commonwealth assesses projects against the guidelines and then recommends funding, which should enable each project to commence. It then goes on to say the guidelines are clear about what projects are not to be funded. The guidelines include new iconic facilities, such as libraries, multipurpose halls, classrooms, upgrading facilities in primary schools, science laboratories and language learning centres. The ever-interjecting member for Sturt seems, on the one hand, to welcome funding for his schools yet, on the other hand, stands at the dispatch box and attacks that funding - not that there is any opportunism in that, but I will just leave his constituents to make that judgment.We also say - and this is in the guidelines:If a school considers that a proposed allocation of funding under the BER program is not in accordance with the BER guidelines, the school may put its concerns in writing to the National BER Co-ordinator who may, where appropriate, after considering the objectives of the BER program and the BER guidelines, discuss the school's concerns with the relevant State/Territory or BGA for the purposes of ensuring that funding is allocated in accordance with the BER guidelines.The bottom line is this: when you are rolling out constructions at 7½ thousand schools across the country, there are always going to be disagreements on the ground about what should occur. That is natural; that is normal. As I said way back then, there are always going to be bumps in the road. But here we have got a clear statement in the guidelines that, if there are problems experienced by individual P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs, there is an appropriate point at which to lodge a concern and to have that concern heard.The Leader of the Opposition seems to have disappeared since he asked the question. Where is he?An honourable member - He is behind the Speaker's chair. - If the Leader of the Opposition is paying attention to the question that he just asked, I say to him, as I say to other members: given his statement of principled concern about Building the Education Revolution projects, does he object to the way in which these moneys are being invested in these schools: $3 million in Ascham School at Edgecliff; $2 million in Bondi Beach Public School at Bondi - are there problems there?; $3 million in Cranbrook School; $2½ million in Kambala at Rose Bay; $2 million in Kesser Torah College at Dover Heights; $2½ million in Kincoppal-Rose Bay School of the Sacred Heart; $2½ million in Montessori East at Bondi; and $850,000 in Moriah College at Bondi Junction - do I hear any interjections about that? No. There is also Plunkett Street Public School, with $789,000; Reddam House Woollahra, with $250,000 - I am waiting for an objection from the Leader of the Opposition; St Anthony's Primary School in Clovelly; St Catherine's School in Waverley; St Charles' Primary School in Waverley; Sydney Grammar School in Edgecliff; Scots College -  - I am going through the list here: Waverley College, Waverley Public School, Yeshiva College, Bondi -  - I am waiting to hear for which of those allocations to which of those schools in the member for Wentworth's electorate he believes he has a problem with the funding. I have not heard him issue a statement about which of those he has a problem with the funding for. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will in the debate on matters of public importance - it being Thursday - stand up and tell us for which of those schools he objects to the funding. What it goes to highlight is the fundamental double standards and opportunism of this entire debate. We have said from the outset that there would be funding for schools - government and non-government, primary and secondary - The member for North Sydney then left the chamber. - to provide stimulus to the economy to support jobs, business and apprenticeships today while building the education infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That is the government's program - it is building the education revolution. When it comes to the individual appeal processes within it, they are amply described in the guidelines, which were put out when the program was first released in February and they should be deployed by any concerned P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. In the middle of a global recession, one of the most important policy objectives any government can have is to deliver the maximum amount of certainty through clear-cut decisions that support jobs and that support business. That is why the government moved so quickly and decisively last year and again this year to put in place the bank guarantee and to put in place the stimulus - phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3. They have all been put in place to support business and to support employment in the face of this very savage global recession.We have been opposed in those measures every step of the way by those opposite. They have now taken this negative approach to a new level, with the delay in the legislation for the renewable energy target, which is in the Senate today. Katie Lahey from the Business Council of Australia made a point some time ago which I think goes to the very core of how bloody-minded and how irresponsible the opposition are when it comes to the basic economic facts that we are facing and what must be done to support our people. This is what Katie Lahey had to say:To drag on the debate whilst we have got this global financial crisis is just one more complexity that business has got to factor into its planning cycle, and for some businesses it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.The point here is that this is very damaging for confidence in a very important sector - the renewable energy sector. We do know, for example, that the Climate Institute has projected that there are $31 billion worth of clean energy projects underway or planned in response to the government's legislation. These projects do represent jobs, and you would have thought that those opposite could have supported such a positive measure. But yet again they have voted against assistance to households, to businesses and to community groups. They do not care about the flow-on impact, for example, in terms of solar credit. Why have they got to this completely irresponsible position? Because they are so divided - so divided between the sceptics and the others who may be able to recognise the importance of climate change - that they cannot take a decision. So it is the disunity of the coalition that is producing the delay and impacting on confidence. They cannot unify when the national interest demands it.It is a shame, because we have seen some more employment data today which indicates that stimulus is having a substantial impact on our economy. The retail employment figures, out today, are holding up much better than they are anywhere else in the world. Despite a very small decline in retail employment in recent months, today's figures show that there are 15,250 more Australians employed in the retail sector now than in November last year - a very, very good result in the circumstances.Let's just compare that to what is happening elsewhere in the world. In the US there are 308,000 fewer retail jobs than there were last November. - It is considered nevertheless that the Chair has sufficient authority to deal with irrelevance or tedious repetition in answers.In other words, 'sit them down' has been the practice of the past. - I was making the point that there are 15,250 more Australians employed in the retail sector now than in November last year. Everyone on this side of the House thinks that is a pretty good outcome and that it is worth talking about - unlike those opposite, who do not have any real concern about the need to support employment in the Australian economy. I was comparing that outcome to the outcome in other advanced economies. In the US there are 308,000 fewer retail jobs than there were last November; in Canada, 37,000 fewer; in the UK, 32,000 fewer; and in New Zealand, 31,000 fewer. What that tells us is that we are doing very well compared to the rest of the world.When we look at the construction sector, we see that an additional 10,000 construction jobs have been added in the three months from February this year. Look at the comparable figures in terms of other countries. The US construction sector has shed 290,000 jobs during that period. Canada has shed 30,000 construction jobs during that period.What these figures give us is further evidence that our stimulus efforts are helping to support employment, and that is why the behaviour of the coalition in this House and the behaviour of the coalition in the upper house is so reprehensible and irresponsible - because there has been an impact on confidence and there has been an impact on demand. It is supporting employment, and those outcomes are opposed every step of the way by those opposite.</DOC>

 - What stuns me about this entire line of argument from the opposition is where they stood on education performance in their 12 years in office, when one piece of data after the other demonstrated us falling down the OECD table of education performance. Early childhood education, for example, had the lowest - the wooden spoon - performance across the OECD. Then there was the investment in government schools by those opposite: they had an appalling record over the 12 years in which they were in office. Then there was the stripping out of funds from our universities.What we have done in the period that we have been in office, led by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Education, is give effect to an education revolution by an investment in the quality of our schools and in the infrastructure that is available to them. I say to the honourable member as he cries crocodile tears about the investment of funds into schools in Sydney and elsewhere that he should refer to the guidelines and the provisions for handling things like this.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. I look forward to being in his electorate once again in a couple of weeks time. The member for Forde has a great interest in infrastructure in his growing part of South-East Queensland. I am asked about road funding. The government is spending some $36 billion over six years on nation-building transport infrastructure, including $8.5 billion in new funding. This includes funding for long overdue road projects like the duplication of the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway, the widening of the Ipswich Motorway, the Kempsey bypass and the construction of the Hunter Expressway. Indeed, we will spend $28 billion on roads over six years. This will deliver over 120 major projects, additional assistance for local roads, upgrades to thousands of dangerous black spots, safety measures at high-risk level crossings and additional rest stops for truckies.I was asked about how this compares to previous Commonwealth spending on roads. The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics Transport Statistics Year Book 2009, which was released today, collates historic data on a range of transport infrastructure. It reveals that the average annual road spend during the Howard government's last six years was just $2.7 billion. In contrast, our road spend over our first six years in office will be $4.7 billion a year. This equates to some $12.7 million every day for the next six years - and under economic circumstances that are far more challenging than the circumstances the mining boom created, with record revenues flowing into government coffers.They get a bit excited over there when we talk about infrastructure and our agenda. I was also asked by the member for Forde about the response to the Infrastructure Australia process that we have established. We know that those opposite did not support the IA process. We know that they have been critical the whole way through; we know that they opposed and voted against the Nation Building and Jobs Plan; we know that they voted against the nation-building legislation; we know that they voted against the $42 billion economic stimulus plan in February; and we know that they have been critical of the $4.7 billion plan of last December.But when I looked at what they were doing around the country, I was staggered, frankly. They say that imitation is the highest form of flattery. There was a press release by the New South Wales opposition leader Barry O'Farrell. He has announced that the Liberals and Nationals in New South Wales:_ will create Infrastructure NSW to improve the identification, prioritisation and delivery of critical public infrastructure _That is pretty interesting. The press release says:Infrastructure NSW will:Identify public infrastructure needs;Establish priorities and recommend timelines for delivery;Sound familiar? It goes on:Advise on project procurement, contractual arrangements, best practice, delivery and funding modes; _They advise that it will support private funding for infrastructure. Later on in the press release - and wait for this - they advise:Infrastructure NSW is built on the successful Infrastructure Australia, Partnerships UK and Partnerships Victoria models.That is what they are saying in New South Wales, the home state of the member for Wentworth.People who look at what Infrastructure Australia has done with any objectivity whatsoever have to support the process that this government has established. Their opportunism in opposing all of these measures is highlighted by Barry O'Farrell and the New South Wales Liberal-National announcement today. We know that the coalition party room is a mess here. I wonder whether there was any consultation whatsoever before this announcement was made. But I guess we will not find out, because I am still waiting to receive a question from the shadow minister for infrastructure about any of the measures that we have undertaken.</DOC>

 - I always enjoy the interjections by the member for Canning, who made a personal explanation recently and said he supported government borrowing in order to provide investment in schools in his electorate. Today he has a different tune, but, then again, opportunism is writ large on the faces of those opposite.As I said in response to the first question from the Leader of the Opposition, the Building the Education Revolution guidelines contain a specific provision that P&amp;Cs or parent bodies who consider that a proposed allocation of funding under the BER program is not in accordance with the guidelines should write to the national BER coordinator, who may, where appropriate, after considering the objectives of the BER program and guidelines, discuss the school's concerns with the relevant state and territory or block grant authority. That was outlined in the guidelines to begin with, and I would say to any P&amp;C and any P&amp;F out there across the country: in the implementation of a program which goes to 7½ thousand primary schools across the nation, as we said from the beginning, inevitably you are going to have discussions and disagreements at the local level about what is wanted. That is normal; that is natural; that is why we have had so many representations, I think, from members on that side of the House and members here about finessing details on the ground. That is normal and natural. That is why the guidelines contain an explicit provision, which they do, about an opportunity for P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs to reflect those views to the national BER coordinator - and I invite them all to do so.I am very pleased that the member for Sturt has asked this question as well, because I would like him to also begin to reflect on which of these allocations he would find unacceptable in the electorate of Sturt. Burnside Primary School, which I understand he attended, was $2½ million. Campbelltown Primary School at Paradise -  - In this debate about the allocation of funding, I would draw your attention to the stark contrast with the Auditor-General's report in relation to the regional program -  - the regional rorts program under the previous government, which indicated an excessive concentration of resources in particular seats held by a particular party, namely the National Party. Ten seats represented what proportion of the overall allocation? - Half of the overall allocation. What we have said from the outset is that we are out there to support the economy as a whole and the education system as a whole, government electorates and non-government electorates, government schools and non-government schools. The objective of the exercise is to provide employment opportunities for tradies, for sparkies, for local people and small business, and for others who are contributing to the construction industry in the country, as opposed to sitting on our hands and doing nothing.Again I go back to the member for Sturt, who is obviously very sensitive about the investments which are being made in his electorate. I look forward to his subsequent statement about which of these - I presume he can speak in the MPI debate - he objects to: Burnside Primary School classroom redevelopment, half a million dollars; Campbelltown Primary School classroom refurbishment, $600,000; Campbelltown Primary School library new construction, $1.4 million; East Marden Primary School new construction, $2½ million; East Torrens Primary School library new construction, $1.7 million; East Torrens Primary School classroom refurbishment, $300,000; Gilles Plains Primary School hall new construction, $2 million; Heritage College -  - Plainly those opposite are embarrassed at the recitation of the funding allocations to the individual schools within their electorates. That is why every parliamentary device will be used by those opposite. They stand up and try to interrupt a clear description of what investments are proposed for individual schools within their area.To go back to the member for Sturt's electorate: Heritage College at Oakden, $2 million for the construction of a multipurpose hall with student amenities; Highbury Primary School library new construction, $1.6 million; Highbury Primary School hall refurbishment, $1.4 million; Hillcrest Primary School, $850,000; Klemzig Primary School, $2 million. I have only just got up to K; it goes all the way to Z.I say to the honourable member for Sturt, therefore, that, when he is seeking at the dispatch box to launch a negative attack on this overall program, he has simultaneously a moral responsibility in this place to make it clear to each of those school communities which of the allocations to them he objects to. I would invite each member who would rise in this place to do the same because at the end of the day you cannot walk two sides of the street here.I also say to the honourable member who has asked the question that the other rationale for what we have done through the school modernisation program is this: how do you boost also small business and jobs? I draw the honourable member's attention to today's Sensis survey that shows that confidence among small and medium sized businesses recorded the biggest increase on record in the three months to May. I was challenged earlier on about whether the government would be saying something positive about the economy. I note there is conspicuous silence on the part of those opposite. This, of course, comes on the back of the biggest increase in consumer confidence in 22 years. The survey states:Again this quarter the Federal Government's economic stimulus packages provided the main reason that SMEs -  - The Building the Education Revolution program, which I have been asked a question about, goes to the implementation on the ground of this project to boost education performance in Australia and the underlying rationale, which is to provide also stimulus to the economy in the midst of the worst global recession in 75 years. Sensis says:The main reason that SMEs gave for supporting the Federal Government was the economic stimulus plan.That includes, of course, infrastructure development.Whether it is on the infrastructure side, the employment side, the job side or the Building the Education Revolution side, the government is proud of this program. Of course, as I said before in answer to earlier questions, there will always be discussions and disagreements on the ground about what priorities should be attached. That is normal. That is why the guidelines made explicit a provision for local P&amp;Cs to register their concerns. I urge each and every one of them to do that so that any individual matters which need to be attended to can be attended to through the processes we outlined from the outset. - Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. It is understandable that contemporary economic debate is very heavily focused on the global recession and the various initiatives the government has taken to deal with the consequences flowing from that - in particular the stimulus packages, the guarantees of bank activity, and things of that nature. I want to emphasise today that the government is resolutely and relentlessly focused on the longer term horizons for the future prosperity of the Australian economy. In this context there is one paramount objective, a single word that underlines everything that the government is seeking to do: productivity. Productivity is at the heart of the Rudd government's agenda for the long-term future of the Australian economy.Australia did pretty well on productivity throughout the 1990s as a result of many reforms that were put in place, mostly during the 1980s and in some cases early 1990s. Deregulation of the financial system, major reform of tariff protection, investment in education and research and development, export diversification, enterprise bargaining - a whole range of reforms were put in place and the Australian economy reaped the benefits. Over the five years to 1998-99, productivity grew on average by 3.3 per cent; in the subsequent five years to 2003-04 that average dropped to 2.2 per cent; and in the four years beyond that to 2007-08 that productivity growth average dropped to 1.1 per cent.While the government are focused on sustaining jobs in the short term, all of our critical economic initiatives have been focused also on developing productivity growth into the medium and longer term. I refer to the broadband network proposal; greater investment in universities; reform of research and development allowances; investment in road, rail and port infrastructure - things such as the Hunter Expressway, the Oakajee Port project and regional rail in Victoria. All of these things will have a huge positive impact on productivity into the future for the Australian economy. We march towards a seamless national economy through regulatory reform, harmonisation of state based regulation and, of course, greater efficiency in government spending and government programs - these are all part of the total picture.Yesterday I raised a leaflet that the Liberal Party put out about their economic position. I have to confess that I had cause to return to that leaflet this morning. -  - I know that some of my colleagues are questioning my choice of leisure activities, but I could not resist - the temptation overcame me. The interesting thing is that I pointed out yesterday that there is no mention of the global recession in this leaflet that is a statement of the Liberal Party economic position, and after having a look at it again today I discovered that there is also not a single reference to productivity, no reference whatsoever to the long-term holy grail of economic reform in the Australian economy and not a single reference to what is the greatest challenge for the Australian economy: improving productivity. The pattern is the same: born-to-rule complacency that characterised their nearly 12 years in office that is now manifested by endless point scoring, opportunistic sniping and talking down the Australian economy as a substitute for genuine economic policy. In particular it is manifested by relentless attacks and opposition to the key reforms and key investments the government is putting in place to boost productivity in the Australian economy in the long term. Attacking the broadband network proposal, opposing investment in infrastructure, sniping at the school investments - all of these things are characteristic of the opportunism of the Liberal Party.I note this morning that, in addition to not putting up any savings measures themselves, as well as opposing the government's savings measures, the opposition regard past inefficiencies in government as totally trivial matters. There was the Sea Sprite fiasco that occurred on their watch, where $1.4 billion of federal government money went west. I note that the Leader of the Opposition, in an interview on AM this morning - and I have the transcript with me - said that this fiasco, this $1.4 billion, was 'a distraction' and 'a complete diversion'. That was his summary of one of the most embarrassing cases of government waste in the history of the Commonwealth that occurred while he and his government were in office.Even in areas where the opposition claim to support the government, they do not know what is going on. Two initiatives in the opposition leader's budget reply speech were that he would have a one-stop portal for filings by business and that he would have a standardised procurement contract for people purchasing from the government. There is one slight problem with these two initiatives: both of them are already occurring. They were so slipshod and complacent that they did not even know that these initiatives are already underway under the Rudd government's reform agenda.It is understandable that everybody in economic debate is focused on the global financial crisis and the short-term threat that is posed to the Australian economy by the global recession. We have a big challenge facing us in this country, because once we get through that short-term challenge there is the longer term challenge of productivity. The world will be more competitive, it will be more challenging for Australia, and we have had a lost decade -  - I am very distressed, Tony, that you see the -  - We have had a lost decade in Australia -  - I thought I told you to stay in the car and bark at strangers! - Australia faces a great challenge on productivity into the medium-term future, and the opposition has had the luxury for the last 18 months of nobody treating them seriously. But times are changing. The member for Higgins is departing, an election is coming over the horizon within 18 months and it is long overdue -  -  - No, I have not. - I will conclude. - The government is focused on pursuing the productivity growth that this country needs to re-establish. It is long overdue that the opposition join mainstream debate in this country instead of sniping, instead of opportunism - </DOC>

 - I am very pleased to get a question, while representing the Deputy Prime Minister, about education and infrastructure. An important part of the government's commitment to infrastructure is indeed the $14.7 billion Building the Education Revolution fund. That is delivering infrastructure to every primary school in the country, including to the electorate of the member for Barker: Angaston Primary School, $950,000; Berri Primary School, $2 million; Bordertown, $2.5 million; Morgan, $2.5 million. All of these schools will benefit, including Naracoorte Primary School - and not just Naracoorte Primary School but Naracoorte South Primary School as well - because we on this side of the House are determined to deliver for every school in the country, no matter how unfortunate they might be in being represented by the member for Barker, who, of course, voted against this very project. -  - I am asked about -  - We have made it very clear and the Minister for Education has indeed made it very clear in this House that, where issues are raised, they will be dealt with. Indeed, I refer to the Australian article today which had an edited letter from the principal of the Berwick Lodge Primary School and -  -  - I have here a letter. This goes to the question of when issues are raised about the rollout of the Building the Education Revolution program - precisely the question that was asked by the honourable member opposite. A letter from the federal member for La Trobe -  -  - What, you do not want to hear what he had to say? - When issues are raised, the education minister has made it clear they will be dealt with. Indeed, the federal member for La Trobe has written to the Minister for Education -  -  - The federal member for La Trobe has written to the Minister for Education, in a letter received in the office of the Deputy Prime Minister just this week, about Berwick Lodge Primary School, a school that is mentioned on the front page of the newspaper today. The opposition attempted to table the newspaper article, but because we subscribe to the Australian we actually had it and did not need that. He said this to Julia Gillard: 'Minister, you resolved this matter for Berwick Lodge Primary recently, which I was very pleased about.' That is what they actually say, those opposite, when it comes to the specifics. - I am talking about Building the Education Revolution, a program which they know when they are in their electorates is supported by the community in their electorates, but they come here to Canberra and have a different message. There is one message in Canberra and another in their electorates when it comes to all of this government's nation-building infrastructure programs, including the Building the Education Revolution program. The fact is that the member for La Trobe has written to the Minister for Education. I am sorry if I take the member for La Trobe at his word and quote him from the letter that he wrote to the Minister for Education.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. Despite the worst global recession in 75 years, we are weathering the storm here in Australia better than most other countries, and that is because of the action the government have taken through our Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. Last week I visited the northern suburbs of Adelaide with the member for Wakefield to see firsthand some work in Elizabeth Grove. We met with Don Belperio, the owner of Lodge Construction, who has won a contract for nine major renovations. Work will start soon in the same area on building 30 new houses in the first stage of constructing new public housing. Mr Belperio told me:Building work has picked up since the stimulus money. It was slacking off earlier in the year. I have had to put on more subcontractors - electricians, plasterers, concreters, ironworkers, floor covering specialists, gyprockers and labourers.He told me that many of those jobs were for people who come from the local Elizabeth area, very important in generating local employment.That is not just happening in Elizabeth. It is not just happening in Adelaide. It is happening right across the country. In Bega last week, with the member for Eden-Monaro, I met a local builder who was putting on extra contractors to put new kitchens into old public housing dwellings. Those new kitchens had been made by another small business just down the road in Eden.In south-east Melbourne, with the member for Isaacs, I met a local builder who said, 'The government initiatives are really keeping my industry buoyant.' In Sydney's inner west, with the member for Lowe, I met tradies who said that they were busier than ever repairing a house that will be retained as public housing for the long term, a beautiful older house in an older neighbourhood - a perfect home for a needy family. The government's stimulus package is having an impact beyond these direct jobs: the repairs, maintenance and the new building. When I was visiting the member for Port Adelaide's electorate, I visited Mawson Lakes, which is a very nice development. It is a well-planned community with a very good range of properties, including properties at the modest end suitable for first-home buyers. It is close to public transport. It is well planned. I met there one of the developers who is working in that area, a woman called Fairlie Delbridge, who is the managing director of her own company, Delcooke Property Group, which is building 20 units in that Mawson Lakes development. She said to me:I had made a large investment in getting this development going. At the preliminary stage of the development I had only nine presales. Then the global financial crisis hit and I couldn't get funding. Banks stopped lending. By the time the stimulus package was announced, I had 12 presales but the project still wasn't bankable. When Housing South Australia purchased five units, it absolutely got my development over the line. With 17 presales it made the project eminently bankable. It green-lighted my whole project.Ms Delbridge credits the nation-building economic stimulus package with making her project feasible and she told me she expects to have about 50 tradies on site for between eight and 12 months. Those jobs happened because of our investment and our cooperation with the South Australian government - the whole project green-lighted, with 50 jobs for between eight and 12 months. Those 50 jobs would not have happened without this investment.Mawson Lakes shows that our investment in the stimulus package has kept this sector ticking over at a time when otherwise we would have seen a crash in this area. We have got plans for nation building for recovery. We have got plans for returning the budget to surplus. We now have the fastest economic growth in the world, the lowest deficit and the lowest debt of major advanced economies in the world. It would be absolutely terrific if the opposition acknowledged the strengths of the Australian economy at this difficult time instead of trashing our reputation and trashing confidence with their relentless negativity.</DOC>

 - I can certainly confirm two things. I can confirm that this school will be getting funding, because every school will be getting funding, including every school in Grey. And the second thing I can confirm is that the member for Grey voted against it. They are the two things that I can confirm for sure. - Mr Speaker, they come in here and they say that they are opposed to spending on these schools, they say that there is waste in these schools, and yet back in their electorates they are out supporting it. I can confirm that people in the southern part of Australia have said this:The electorate has also been in the fortunate position to have received a number of federal funding grants to improve and support the local community. Along with funding towards the Wantirna South Sports Complex, over 40 primary and secondary schools as well as special needs educational -  - The member for Sturt then left the chamber. - I was asked a question about Building the Education Revolution; I am giving an answer about Building the Education Revolution and they do not like it. Well, they say they do not like it, but this is what they say in their newsletters. This is what the member for Aston said in his newsletter: that schools in Aston are beneficiaries of successful applications for federal funding. - In their newsletters they are actually outlining every school that is getting funding in their electorates and claiming credit for it. That is what they are doing back in their electorates. - </DOC>

 - What we see here is a Leader of the Opposition who is simply swinging in the breeze, a Leader of the Opposition who came into this place and said publicly that I should resign and that the Treasurer should resign. He based his entire attack on the existence of an email which is a fake and a forgery. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that there is only one honourable course of action for him today. It is to stand up and tender his resignation as Leader of the Opposition.There is a second course of action if that moment of decency escapes him, and that is to stand at the dispatch box and provide a formal assurance to the House that each and every one of his staff and the computer facilities and resources available to him and all members of the opposition will be made fully available to the police investigation and provide a parallel undertaking that no emails be deleted from the systems of the computers used by the opposition. -  - What we have learned, regrettably, from those who laugh so loudly at this point is that the Liberal Party, on the matter of deceptive information, has form historically. This is the Liberal Party that gave us 'children overboard'. It is the Liberal Party that was so active in the field in the Lindsay electorate on the eve of the last election, and most recently in South Australia.</DOC>

 - I certainly thank the member for Lowe for his question. Of course, the government do have a big legislative agenda, because we have got a big vision for this nation. We have got a vision which is about dealing with the global economic crisis. We have got a vision which is about returning fairness to the workplace. We have got a vision which is about taking action to avoid dangerous climate change. Day after day, we come into this House and we put forward our vision through our legislative program. Indeed, this morning we had a series of bills to be introduced to this House. One of those was what has become known as the alcopops legislation. It was here, ready to be introduced by the Minister for Health, but of course that was not possible because, as usual, the opposition are not actually interested in a policy agenda.They tried a scare campaign over the economy, a campaign of fear about debt and deficit, a campaign of fear about the CPRS. Their strategy - or tactics, because they do not really have any strategy - changed on 3 June, when the national accounts revealed that the government's economic strategy had prevented Australia from going into a technical recession. So, from that point on, it all changed. They avoided questions on the economy, they avoided debate on the big issues facing the nation, and still they decided to go the low road: the low road of smear against the Prime Minister and against the Treasurer. Ever since that day, 4 June, they have been running around the gallery and running around talking to anyone who will listen, saying that they have a smoking gun, saying that there is an email that proves that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer misled this parliament. - Mr Speaker, I am certainly doing that, and I will continue to do that. We on this side of the House have a positive agenda for the nation. Those on that side of the House have a campaign which is to stop the government from pursuing our legislative program by pursuing a program of smear against the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and fear about the government's legislative agenda.Today we saw the extraordinary circumstances whereby the Leader of the Opposition came into this House and moved a motion - he was granted leave to move that motion - and, before that same debate had concluded, he came back into this House and changed his position. He came in and spoke again and changed his position and then called for a judicial inquiry - completely different from the position which he moved in the parliament today. He cannot hold a position for a matter of hours, let alone for what is needed given the circumstances of the government's position.But of course those opposite want to engage in this smear campaign. Last Friday, we had the Leader of the Opposition standing up and calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister, calling for the resignation of the Treasurer -  - We on this side of the House would prefer to have a debate about our legislative agenda and our plans for nation building for recovery. That is what we on this side of the House want. Those on that side of the House are blocking this because they have nothing to say about the future of this country, because they have no policy alternative, no policy vision, which is why they have gone down to the politics of smear. The fact that they cannot even hold a position - the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has to speak twice in a debate, giving contradictory positions - says it all.The fact is that they came in and promised a smoking gun. Well, there was no chk-chk boom in the parliament today. There was nothing at all. The Leader of the Opposition has fallen flat on his face. His smear campaign has no credibility. He should table the email. And he should resign.</DOC>

 - It is the case, and I made it very clear earlier, that I stood by all of the statements that I have made to the House 100 per cent. In the case of Mr Grant, he received no special benefit from OzCar and he received no outcome from Ford Credit whatsoever. It is also the case that I did say that he was treated in the same way as other car dealers were treated. Other car dealers were of course referred on to financiers, and I spent some time talking about that in the House today.There was also some criticism directed at me for having faxes go to my home. I simply could not believe it when we heard the laughter from the other side that the Treasurer of Australia might actually have a fax at 5.14 pm on a Friday! It says something about their approach and their work ethic that they would think that it is hilarious that the Treasurer of Australia would receive a fax at 5.14 pm on a Friday. I do not think they would think at all about busting their gut for the Australian people on a Friday night, a Saturday or a Sunday, but we will do everything that we possibly can to support employment in the Australian community. My fax whirrs through the night because the thing about a global financial crisis is it does not respect time zones. Around that stage when faxes were coming in, we were working very hard and indeed working around the clock.There were a variety of car dealers who contacted my office, other offices and the Treasury. They worked through the MTAA and made contact with the Treasury. I spoke - and I said this very clearly in my doorstop - to Mr Grant following a representation from Mr Bernie Ripoll. I spoke to him for a couple of minutes. I referred him to my DLO and he was then dealt with by that DLO in the way in which the emails indicate. I spoke to him. I do not apologise for that for one minute.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. The government does regard the integrity and transparency of the parliamentary process and the behaviour of elected representatives very seriously, that is why it takes the accusations that were made by the Leader of the Opposition last Friday extremely seriously. The government has taken a number of very important steps to enhance the integrity and transparency of the process of parliament and elected representatives, such as electoral reform, which unfortunately is blocked in the Senate, that would reduce the limit on donations and ban foreign donations, such as the Operation Sunlight set of transparency reforms for budget disclosure and such as the involvement of the Auditor-General in scrutinising government advertising to determine that it is not politically motivated.Although the government is committed to all of these reforms and others to ensure that we maximise the quality of behaviour and the transparency, accountability and integrity of our parliamentary process and representatives, we unfortunately cannot prevent everything from occurring. Sadly, last Wednesday night at the press gallery ball there was an incident involving the Leader of the Opposition which indicated the limits that are there, whether we like it or not, because of the behaviour of individuals who do not seem to treat the obligations and responsibilities of their offices seriously. I would like to quote from the statement circulated by Mr Andrew Charlton, adviser to the Prime Minister, about this incident. His recollection of the statements by the Leader of the Opposition to him at that event -  - Thanks, Mr Speaker. I quote Mr Charlton's recollection of the statements by the Leader of the Opposition:Let me give you some advice because I think you have a very promising career ahead of you.Integrity is the most important thing in the career of a young man._            _            _That is why I encourage you, no matter what the circumstances, no matter what the pressure, not to lie._            _            _This whole Ozcar issue will be very damaging for you.Let me just give you some friendly advice.You should not lie to protect your boss._            _            _You know and I know there is documentary evidence that you have lied.Everybody knows what the term 'friendly advice' means in that context. It is code for 'crude threat' - that is what 'friendly advice' means in those circumstances.What we have here is the Leader of the Opposition seeking to intimidate a member of the Prime Minister's staff by claiming he has documentary evidence that he lied. I had a vague recollection of similar words. I notice that a former staffer to a former member for Wentworth, Mr Peter King, had made similar statements about the conduct of the member for Wentworth some time ago. He was rung at his home by the member for Wentworth -  - The quote that caught my eye was:You lied, John. You've got to tell the truth. People could go to jail. Just tell me the truth. It is just so important to tell the truth.There is a remarkably familiar ring to the statements that the adviser to the Prime Minister stated had been made by the Leader of the Opposition. - I note that the Leader of the Opposition, when this matter was raised with him in public a couple of days ago, stated that he was simply reminding somebody of the ninth commandment, which he seems to do a lot of. There seems to be a pattern of bullying that fits the Crabb profile and the behaviour with respect to the Costigan royal commission. Integrity and behaviour are important in public life. Not only do we have a situation in which the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to allege corruption against the Prime Minister with not a shred of evidence but we have a Leader of the Opposition who has also been engaged, on the basis of what has now been determined to be a fake email, in bullying the Prime Minister's staff in order to try and force that person to lie. That is the truth of this matter.</DOC>

 - When I was asked that question in the House, I did have no idea of what the outcome of that case was. There were no further emails to me about Mr Grant from the department and/or updates in my in tray, which I was receiving on a regular basis. The fact is, this was a very serious matter. I was concerned about what was going on in the industry. I was getting updates from the department. But on this occasion they were not going to my home fax because I was not at home; they were going to my in tray. There were updates coming through from the department on the number of dealers that had experienced difficulties and the progress of all of the issues, including the creation of OzCar, the whole issue of Ford Credit and so on. There was plenty of information coming to me on the state of the industry and how dealers were affected.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. When it comes to the proper functioning of markets and our public debate, it is more than a little important that the highest standards of integrity and honesty be maintained. Our legal framework for dealing with deceptive conduct in the business world is also vital to ensure that consumers and investors are fully informed in making financial decisions, because without access to truthful information the market simply would not function properly as poor economic decisions would be made. Investors, companies and consumers have the right to truthful information - much the same as citizens and voters have the right to that truthful information.I was asked about concerns about the sale of certain insurance companies. The House may be aware of concerns relating to the tactics that surrounded the selling of FAI insurance to HIH, which played a very important role in the downfall of HIH. In 1997, Goldman Sachs Australia considered being a party to the purchase of FAI. After a thorough study of the business of FAI, the chairman of Goldman Sachs Australia concluded that the business was in bad shape and was worth very little. That chairman was Mr Malcolm Turnbull.On 7 September 1998, Mr Turnbull sent a memorandum to Goldman Sachs executives in New York advising them that the assets of the business were worth very little. He said:We estimate that the true net assets of FAI (that is, after write-downs and unwinding of reinsurance contracts) is approximately $20 million, compared with a stated book value of $220 million.Fair enough. They did their work with due diligence and decided that it was not worth very much at all. But Mr Turnbull then agreed to help Mr Rodney Adler sell FAI insurance. In the process of finding a buyer, it would be common practice for FAI to appoint an independent valuation expert to give potential buyers some information about the value of the business. Mr Turnbull not only did not advise them to do this; he advised them not to do it. Mr Turnbull wrote to Mr Adler recommending against the appointment of an independent financial examination of FAI, stating, 'It may not be in FAI shareholders' interests to have such an investigation conducted and presented.'On 11 January 1999 - four months after Mr Turnbull argued that there was little value in the FAI business - on the basis of information provided by FAI and Mr Turnbull the insurance firm HIH purchased FAI for $295 million. - The now member for Wentworth therefore noted that the assets were truly worth $20 million but was involved in the sale of FAI insurance for $295 million. On 21 June 2006, the liquidator of HIH served a claim on Mr Turnbull, the now member for Wentworth - and others - seeking $529 million in damages, comprising the $295 million -  - Thanks, Mr Speaker. We have a claim seeking $529 million in damages, comprising the $295 million paid by HIH for FAI and $234 million in interest. The HIH liquidator -  -  - This claim was that Mr Turnbull and others misled the non-executive directors of FAI. The Acting Leader of the House is on his feet! - I should disclose to the House that this matter has now been settled by a confidential settlement. We do not know the details but we know it has been settled. But there will be no confidential settlement about misleading behaviour on other matters in the House over the last few hours. There is nowhere to hide from this one. There will be no confidential settlement on lying about an email, because he might be able to hide behind a confidential settlement in the business world but you cannot hide behind one in politics. -  -  - Interjections and mumblings! I am saying to people, now, that that type of language will not be allowed. - Thanks, Mr Speaker. We now know that the Leader of the Opposition never lets the facts get in the way of his ambition - whether it was HIH or the ute affair. He cannot hide in this particular matter. The Australian people will hold him to account for putting his ambition ahead of the facts.</DOC>

 - As I was saying in the debate this morning, the Treasury was putting car dealers in contact with financiers simply because -  -  - They were doing it all the time because OzCar had not been established and, as the correspondence makes abundantly clear, the only course for those dealers who were having their finance withdrawn by GE Finance or GMAC was for them to be picked up by those that were in the market at the moment. -  -  - As the correspondence that was tabled -  - The government signalled its intention to discuss matters with Ford Credit back in last December. Those discussions proceeded through the early part of the year because a particular problem had emerged in terms of Ford Credit and it was ultimately resolved in a cabinet decision that was announced after the budget. Of course, there are something like 300 to 400 dealers, particularly in rural and regional Australia, involved with Ford Credit, and the government's decision to involve them in the SPV has been very important in supporting that employment.As the email indicated, those matters were raised at one of those meetings by the responsible Treasury official, but the meeting they were raised at was a meeting that had been organised well before Mr Grant had made his representations to the Treasury, and it was not abnormal for Treasury officials to be talking to those that were providing finance to the industry. This has been made abundantly clear again today by the Motor Trades Association of Australia. I will just run through what Mr Delaney has had to say about that:The treatment that Mr Grant, a member of mine, got was no different from the treatment all of my other members got on my intervention on their behalf to Mr Grech. They were all treated in the same way, and for the same good reason: there was no other way to do these things. In fact, I think Mr Grant has been treated less well because he went to the Treasurer.What was going on here was also, I think, quite well described this morning by Mr Delaney, because he talked about the fact that there was a prospect of $8 billion worth of car financing simply being withdrawn. That was under threat. So Treasury officials, I believe, were legitimately seeking to assist those dealers that may not have been refinanced by those financiers who were leaving the market, and they were putting them in contact with those that were in the market. And, of course, Ford Credit was one of those. All of that is entirely appropriate, but the decisions on that were taken by the Treasury officials.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Of course, on this side of the House we have been arguing for many, many months the importance of this measure that is being introduced into the House again today being passed by the parliament. In addition to the developments that I will come to shortly on the other side of the House, I am very pleased to be able to announce that, as part of our comprehensive strategy in dealing with our binge-drinking culture, we have also today announced an extra $7.1 million which is being allocated across four states for early intervention services to youth with alcohol problems: in the Northern Territory, $2.5 million, particularly targeted to some of our Aboriginal communities; in Tasmania, $700,000; in Victoria, $1.4 million; and, in South Australia, $2.4 million.This is just another part of our strategy to tackle an increasing problem within our community, but it is something that unfortunately those opposite have persistently sidled up to with the distillers and opposed, month after month after month. For more than 12 months, while were trying to close the loophole on alcopops, we saw the Liberal Party do anything that it could to sidle up to the distilling industry. This is despite 21 health experts, the National Coalition for Action on Alcohol Harm, calling for changes. This is despite the calls from doctors in our emergency departments, from police and from parents across the country. This ignores the fact that this measure, since it has been introduced, has reduced the consumption of alcopops by 35 per cent; there has been an eight per cent fall in overall spirits; and, as the budget papers made clear, there has been a 0.5 per cent fall - or, to put it in language that people can more clearly understand, 720,000 fewer standard drinks per week have been consumed as a result of this measure. That is a success in anybody's terms.The member for Dickson and the Leader of the Opposition have been all over the place. Even from, if people remember, the former Leader of the Opposition and the former health spokesperson - we have had more positions than you can possibly imagine from those opposite on this alcopops measure. But today we have seen the triple pike performed, a gold-medal-winning performance from the member for Dickson. He chose the opportunity, if anybody would think about the events today -  - He chose the timing perfectly to announce this backflip. When Mr Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, was on his feet outside the doors, the member for Dickson scurried to do a press conference to announce that the Liberal Party was now, finally, going to support our alcopops measure. We congratulate you for being prepared now, at last, to support his sensible measure. We congratulate you for the very clever timing of this - to detract from this embarrassing humiliation for the member for Dickson.What was interesting in his press conference announcing this was that the member for Dickson did try to say that the Liberal Party was supporting this measure but, on questioning from journalists, could not actually guarantee that was how all of his coalition members would vote. There is such a mess opposite at the moment that it was impossible, apparently, for the shadow minister to make any commitment about how his colleagues in the Liberal Party and in the National Party were actually going to vote.But I would like to congratulate the opposition for finally seeing the merit in this measure - 720,000 fewer standard drinks per week as a result of this measure is something that is having a positive health impact. It is a shame it took them so long to wake up to this reality, but we will welcome their vote for it when the matter is debated later today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for being such a great advocate of behalf of 16,500 pensioners in her electorate and the more than 2,000 carers on top of that. She is doing a fantastic job on behalf of those pensioners and carers. She and everybody else on this side of the House know that this week more than half a million carers are receiving their first permanent instalment of the new carer supplement. It has started being paid to those carers and most of those payments will be made by the end of this week. Of course, 3.3 million pensioners - age pensioners, carers, disability pensioners, wife pensioners - and veterans are all going to benefit from this government's pension reforms, reforms which the previous government ignored for the whole time they were in office. We know that those opposite enjoyed playing that political stunt at the end of last year but even in their political stunt they were determined to campaign to exclude around two million pensioners - married pensioners, carers, disability support pensioners - not caring at all about all of those pensioners who have been doing it tough for so long.It is not only that for 12 long years those opposite ignored the needs of pensioners; what we find now is that those opposite, the coalition members, are now engaged in a campaign of deception to frighten pensioners about these reforms - another campaign of deception. The opposition, as we see day after day in this parliament, say one thing while they are in Canberra and another thing entirely when they are out in their communities. What this leads to is that you cannot believe a word they say. Just listen to this from the community newsletter put out by Senator Fiona Nash. She says about the pension rights, 'It's not all good news seniors. The utilities allowance, which helps seniors with their bills, has been abolished.' Completely false - Senator Nash knows it is completely false and the Leader of the Opposition knows this is completely false. They know that the full value of the utilities allowance is being wound into the new pension supplement and increased. The shadow minister opposite last week even called it 'sensible', but out there Senator Fiona Nash and other members of the opposition are spreading this misinformation and needlessly scaring pensioners to make a political point. Has the Leader of the Opposition done anything to pull his members into line, to make sure they tell pensioners the truth about what is going on? Has he apologised to pensioners for misleading them? Of course he has not. He does not come in here and tell anyone what has happened to this fake email and he does not have the courage to tell pensioners what is actually going on. As is becoming so obvious, this Leader of the Opposition does nothing. He does not care about pensioners; he does not care whether he needlessly scares pensioners; all that he is on about is his own political hide.</DOC>

 - He ought to do the decent thing and resign. He is so desperate. - You ought to do the decent thing and resign. - I do not accept the characterisation of that matter - the way in which it was put by the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that Treasury officials were meeting on behalf of dealers to try and secure finance for them. That is a very important thing that they were doing because many of those dealers -  - No, more than one dealer - many dealers. This has been outlined by Mr Delaney:The treatment that Mr Grant, a member of mine, got was no different from the treatment all of my other members got on my intervention on their behalf to Mr Grech. They were all treated in the same way and for the same good reason - there was no other way to do these things.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for the question. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation is due for debate in the Senate this week and it is time now, with that debate to ensue in the Senate, for the coalition to take responsibility in relation to this important public policy issue, to quell the sceptics in its own ranks, to stop the delay and to support the scheme.The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme has wide support throughout the community. Major environment groups have indicated their support for it, as indeed have major business organisations. It is important to refer to a couple of those representatives of the business organisations in responding to this question. Ms Heather Ridout, the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group, is on record with the following:We - this is on behalf  of the membership of AiG - urge the coalition to work with the government to ensure the best deal for business and pass this legislation this year.Ms Katie Lahey, the CEO of the Business Council, has also contributed:To drag on the debate whilst we have got this global financial crisis is just one more complexity that business has got to factor into its planning cycle, and for some businesses it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.The business community has this attitude because it wishes to secure certainty in the investment environment. Everyone in the business community knows that a carbon price is coming into the Australian economy. We are seeing emissions trading schemes, of course, in many other advanced economies and it is an issue that is well advanced in debate in the US. Business investment certainty is critical and is why the scheme must be passed. It is needed in particular for projects where assets have a long life. For example, if an investment group is planning an investment in an area such as electricity generation or in the resources sector, where assets typically have very long lives, the way in which a carbon price is to be introduced into the economy is extremely important. That is why the business community is so frustrated at the position of the coalition on this important issue. Just last Friday, Mr Greig Gailey, the BCA president, was reported in the Australian as saying:The Liberal and National parties have never been totally clear with us about what their position was, and it's still not clear _Peter Coates, the Chairman of Xstrata in Australia, also made the following observation:The coalition is perceived to have no position on the ETS other than putting it off until next year.These are simply not acceptable positions for the coalition to have after such a long period of time. There has been report after report after report - Professor Garnaut's review, the green paper, the white paper, the exposure legislation and the legislation being debated in this place and now due for debate in the Senate. There is no further excuse for delay. The business community deserves better from the opposition on this important issue.All of the reasons that have been put up by the Leader of the Opposition for further delay in consideration of this important legislation are shot to pieces. One of the arguments put most recently was concerning the desire for the government to put forth regulations dealing with emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries. Last Friday, the government put forth comprehensive material dealing with those regulations. There is now no further excuse. Now all we are seeing is the suggestion that the coalition will filibuster in the Senate, and it is not good enough on this important environmental and economic reform. The coalition has to take responsibility, debate this properly, put forward constructive proposals and support the CPRS.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question, because we have received further news today about the savage consequences of the global recession and its impact on both developed economies and developing countries. We have a further report today from the World Bank that has downgraded its outlook for the global economy. It now expects global output to shrink by 1.7 per cent in 2009. That is more than the World Bank expected just three months ago. It is the case that the major advanced economies are in deep recession, with the World Bank forecasting the US to contract by three per cent in 2009, the euro area by 4.5 per cent and Japan by a massive 6.8 per cent. This report from the World Bank illustrates the difficult year ahead for the global economy, but I think it also demonstrates the importance of global action in the face of this global recession. The report makes this point:Extraordinary policy responses by governments around the world have helped save the global financial system from systemic collapse.It goes on to say that these actions, combined with fiscal stimulus, will 'help reduce the depth and prospective length of the global recession'. Despite the worst global recession in 75 years, Australia is weathering the storm better than virtually every other advanced economy. That is because the government acted decisively and early to shore up confidence in our financial system and to stimulate the economy to support jobs. You could not get a better example of that than the initiative that we took with OzCar, the bank guarantee and also economic stimulus phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3, because we understand the importance of cushioning our economy from the worst impacts of the global recession. I think we can take some heart from the fact that the combination of our resilience and policy action has allowed Australia to have the strongest-performing economy in the developed world. That is the concern of the government; it is certainly not the concern of the rabble opposite.</DOC>

 - I will ask my office to look into this matter. -  - The process is that these come through in a variety of ways. They come through the office, they go directly to the Treasury - they go through in a variety of ways and I follow these things up. I am happy to get back to the member to establish the facts of the case. But it is the case that there needs to be a demonstration of eligibility in some respects for the dealership, their financial viability and so on. These are all things that impact on the capacity of someone to be recommended, because at the end of the day a business does need to be financially viable, financially viable to be taken on by an existing financier or financially viable to be eligible for OzCar, once it is fully operational. Of course it is the case that not all dealerships do meet that requirement and there will be some that will not be able to be assisted because they do not meet the requirements. But I will seek further information on that case as well. Of course Mr Delaney has made the point today that he has been very happy, as a representative industry organisation, with the degree of response that has come from the Treasury to his membership. I am not sure whether those organisations are members of the MTAA or not. It may well be that there are some that have not been catered for properly. I am happy to look into it and I will.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I know he takes seriously the challenges facing the Northern Territory economy - an export focused economy with challenges because of contractions in global trade and therefore requiring an active government out there supporting business at every opportunity in these times of unprecedented global economic difficulty. That is the expectation of us by working families across our nation: right now out there standing in the gap between them and the global recession to reduce the impact of this recession on joblessness in our country. That is what people expect us to do. The people of Australia want us to be standing up for them at a time when jobs are being shed right across the world. They want us to be standing up for the things which matter for them, negotiating our way through this global economic recession, investing in the education revolution, in their schools, investing in our public hospitals where people need to go to get proper medical attention, investing also in the biggest and most significant age pension reform this nation has seen in the 100-year history of the age pension. Also they want a government taking action to abolish Work Choices and to replace Work Choices with a fair and balanced industrial relations system, and acting on the whole challenge of climate change responsibly in a balanced way, ensuring that we can craft a carbon pollution reduction scheme, craft a renewable energy target, to ensure that we are getting it absolutely right for business in our contribution to bring down global greenhouse gases. That is what this government is committed to and that is why we have legislation passing its way through the parliament - a government also getting on with the business of closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. That is what this government has been on about since the time we delivered an apology from this side of the House at the beginning of last year, embarked upon a program of closing the gap, investing in communities of the Northern Territory and elsewhere to make a difference in the lives of Australians.And we are doing so at a time when the global economy is under virtually unprecedented challenge. As the Treasurer indicated in his answer before, the World Bank data released just now on global growth projections for 2009 is a sober reminder to us all that we are not out of the woods. The numbers are stark. The projection is for growth in 2009 to contract by 1.7 per cent. This is one percentage point lower than the March forecast of 0.6 and is weaker than the IMF's forecast. This is not a passing inconsequence to working families across Australia, to pensioners, to carers, to small business people, those out there trying to earn a dollar in a very difficult environment. What we have done as a government is to embark upon a strategy of nation building for recovery and of nation building for the future, to make a difference. That is why we have gone out there and said we are going to support jobs, apprenticeships and small business today by investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That is the government's strategy, and we have been implementing this strategy since the first data of the global recession came flowing into us. That is why we have embarked upon a three-stage strategy, investing, first of all, in support through cash payments for families to try and keep the economy afloat in the critical quarter to the fourth quarter last year, the first quarter this year and the second quarter this year. When the rest of the world was crashing into recession, the economy of Australia in the March quarter kept growth positive. We kept growth positive. That is because government was in there making a difference, investing to support consumption knowing full well it would take time for investment in infrastructure to flow through, which brings us to phase 2 of what we have done on the economy: investing in medium-term infrastructure, the biggest school modernisation program the country has ever seen, one of which local P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs are proud, one of which their communities are proud, because we are out there providing facilities - state-of-the-art language centres, state-of-the-art libraries, state-of-the-art science centres - to make sure our kids have the best education facilities possible for the future and also investments in social housing and investments as well in energy insulation. Then there is phase 3. Phase 3 of our economic strategy is nation building for recovery for our long-term infrastructure, including building for the first time a state-of-the-art 21st century broadband network for all of Australia, for all those areas which have been so neglected by those opposite after 12 years in office.Our strategy is clear: nation building for recovery and supporting jobs, small business and apprenticeships today in order to build the infrastructure that Australia needs for tomorrow. This is, I believe, of some relevance as to why those opposite abandoned the economic policy debate last week. The reason is they were horrified when the growth data for Australia was positive. They were horrified that, in fact, the government's economic strategy was having an effect. They were horrified that, among the most advanced economies, we were generating the fastest economic growth, we were generating the lowest net debt, we were generating a deficit which was lower than the average of the advanced economies and we had the second lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies. That is what the government has been on about, day in, day out, since this economic tidal wave came across the world with the events of last year. That is what we have been doing.When positive economic data came out indicating that businesses and workers were striving hard to make a difference in the face of this recession, and we saw in early evidence a glimpse of good news on the economy - positive growth, virtually unique across the OECD - the opposition moved their campaign from one of political fear on the economy to personal smear in this place. That is exactly what they have done. We have seen a fear campaign on the economy led by the Leader of the Opposition, who simply smirks and smiles in this place as if today's events are of no consequence to your integrity. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: they are fundamental enduring consequences to your integrity because you are being marked by the Australian people for what you have done in the last several days and the fact that you have engaged in the business of transmitting information through your office contained in a false email. -  - I say to those opposite, as they howl in protest, they stood in this place and demanded my resignation and that of the Treasurer and said that this was based on irrefutable evidence, that it was based on their smoking gun, only for it to evaporate completely in smoke today. Those opposite then believe that somehow this will just be forgotten, that the traducing of a person's integrity, such as the traducing of the integrity of the Leader of the Opposition, which has occurred today, will simply be forgotten. My message to the Leader of the Opposition is that it will not be. The Australian people are making a judgment about the man who sits opposite and puts himself forward as the alternative Prime Minister of Australia and he has been found seriously wanting. There is one lone course of action: apologise and resign.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - As the Leader of the Opposition stands and asks any question in this place, I would ask the entire nation to reflect on what credibility can be attached to this Leader of the Opposition, a Leader of the Opposition who has refused to answer with any basic element of credibility. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the only responsible thing for him to do in this parliament today is to resign. -  - It is interesting that in this first question time today, following the extraordinary events of yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition would immediately seek to try and change tack. The Leader of the Opposition's entire attack against the credibility of this government has rested on a forged and faked email, a fraudulent document. Therefore, in a desperate attempt, the Leader of the Opposition has sought today to broaden the agenda, to broaden the attack, out to anything else other than the matters for which he has yet to account fully to this House. The matters on which he has failed to fully account to this House are: firstly, what were his and the opposition's full dealings in relation to this faked and forged email; secondly, what were the opposition's full dealings -  - The second question which the Leader of the Opposition needs to answer in this place is as follows: that is, the Leader of the Opposition's dealings on this matter in relation to the public servant in question. - Once again, the Leader of the Opposition fails to answer these most basic questions: what were his full dealings on the matter of this email and what were his full dealings with the public servant in question? Rather than engage again in the politics of smear, let us have some real evidence here. As I said on the day in question -  - Therefore, in response to the matters which have been canvassed in this House, both today and on other days, I would say that the Leader of the Opposition actually needs to not engage in the continued politics of negative smear but to actually ask substantive questions. -  - They howl and protest as they seek to take the spotlight off themselves. As I said on the day in question, the representations I can recall in relation to that matter were from a car dealer in the electorate of Bennelong - I remember turning around and pointing to the honourable member for Bennelong. That was the one I can recall; they are the representations that were made by me in that respect. That is consistent with the remarks I made on that day.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question because it goes to those matters which all working families in Australia and the entire community want to see the nation's parliament deal with - that is, how are we supporting jobs in the midst of the worst recession that the world has seen in three-quarters of a century; what are we doing to build up our schools, our social housing and the key infrastructure of the nation in order to make a difference? We are not out of the woods yet. Global stock markets suffered significant falls yesterday. The S&amp;P 500 fell 3.06 per cent - its worst day in two months - and in London the FTSE fell by 2.57 per cent. These falls underline the ongoing fragility of the global economy. The falls were caused in part by concerns that unemployment around the world is rising. In a statement yesterday the White House said that the US administration expects unemployment will reach 10 per cent within the next few months. The current unemployment rate reached a 25-year high of 9.4 per cent in May. The global stock market falls are now being attributed to the World Bank's growth downgrade that I referred to in the parliament yesterday.What we have sought to do as a government is to provide a range of measures out there to support the economy at this difficult time. On that account I refer to the report on the front page of today's Financial Review which goes to the business community's response to the business investment allowance that the government announced at the end of last year. The government's investment allowance provides a temporary tax break of 50 per cent for small businesses and 30 per cent for larger companies to encourage new business and new business investment and to provide immediate stimulus to the economy. I am pleased to quote from the article, which says that Healthscope, a private health provider, is bringing forward $5 million worth of spending on surgical equipment, beds and courier cars for its hospitals due to the government's policy. Gary Kent, chief financial officer of Healthscope, said:I think it's a good move by the government _ it's made us focus on [investment] and commit to it _Further, Caltex is bringing forward $9 million worth of pump supply and installation to its stations before 1 July.Also, I had the privilege today of visiting the Trinity Christian School in Wanniassa. I looked carefully there at what the school is doing in the implementation of Building the Education Revolution. I attended that with the local member, Annette Ellis. We spoke to the local principal about how it is actually going to make a difference to that school. There is a building going up worth about $2 million - we saw some of the workmen there this morning - and, as I am advised, it will include about five new learning areas which will be wired to the new economy. On top of that they are extending the library by about a third. It is a school, I am advised, of about 1,139 kids. The Building the Education Revolution makes a difference to local schools like that right across the country. Of course, Trinity Christian School is one of about 7½ thousand primary schools across the country. All members in this House are having these construction projects built across their electorates and their communities to make a difference.In my dealings with principals, P&amp;Cs and P&amp;Fs the overwhelming response is they want to see these projects done. They want to see their schools improve. They want to see that they have the best classrooms, the best libraries, the best multipurpose halls, the best science centres and the best language centres. That is what the government wants for them as well. Therefore, with the government's overall $14.7 billion Building the Education Revolution program, this is being rolled out. Seventy per cent of the total funding for the program is being committed to 20,159 projects across the country. To date an estimated 99.3 per cent of schools have received funding under the National School Pride Program and nearly 65 per cent of schools under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program.These are the practical measures that we have used and deployed in order to make a difference for local communities, for local schoolchildren, but most critically also for the national economy. These are important measures. They are what the community expects of us - helping business by the measures that we put in place by way of the temporary investment allowance and helping school communities and local tradies. I spoke to some carpenters out there this morning - one bloke was a young apprentice working on a building site - and they were supportive of the sorts of projects that we are putting up around the country.This is the positive leadership that the nation expects of a government and of political leaders in our country at a time like this. I contrast positive leadership with the avalanche of negativity from those opposite. Not only are they engaged in a negative fear campaign on debt and deficit to talk the economy down but they have now engaged in a negative smear campaign to try and bring the government down. That is what we have had from those opposite - undiluted negativity. I would say again to the Leader of the Opposition: there are basic questions which the parliament needs to have the answers to in order for him to cease being a roadblock to national recovery - blocking things in the Senate and failing to even allow a vote to occur on the CPRS. He cannot even unite his own party on the question of the passage of alcopops. Then we have of course the absolute shambles that the opposition have been in on the question that we have been debating here in recent days. That is why the Leader of the Opposition has but one honourable course of action, and that is to stand in this parliament to apologise and to resign. As a minimum, the Leader of the Opposition must detail to the parliament all of his and the opposition's dealings in relation to this fake and forged email. They must detail to the parliament -  - Part of dealing with the challenge of ensuring that our measures are in place to deal with the global financial crisis depends on what happens in the Senate. We have complete disunity from those opposite about whether they are going to oppose or support the CPRS, and there is the disappearance of leadership on the part of the Leader of the Opposition as they voted in the Senate today, I am advised - I stand to be corrected on this - to put off a vote, that is, refusing to vote altogether. They voted not to vote. Business wants certainty. Businesses out there, as the generators of economic recovery, want the rules done, yet those opposite are saying, 'Oh, no. Let's not have any leadership on this question.' There is no leadership also on the passage of a measure concerning alcopops. But leadership also means taking responsibility for your actions. Leadership means standing up and explaining the entirety of your dealings in relation to this fake email, the entirety of the dealings in relation to this individual public servant and confirming to the parliament full cooperation on the part of computer systems and the rest in terms of the investigation which the AFP have underway. It is necessary for the Leader of the Opposition, finally and formally, to do the decent thing: stand, apologise and resign.</DOC>

 - Here we go. The smear campaign is now coming from cockies corner. The smear campaign continues. The credibility of those on that side of the House is completely shot. The obligation is on the Leader of the Opposition to come into this House and tell us about his dealings with this fake email. The Leader of the Opposition -  -  - I certainly will, Mr Speaker, because at the core of the discussion about how car dealers were treated and who dealt with them has been the claim by the Leader of the Opposition based on a fake email. He is now so desperate that he is now trying to say that I am responsible for the fake email that he peddled around the country. I could not believe it on AM this morning. It was unbelievable. He has lost the plot. - Yes, I am delighted to respond to the question. The shadow Treasurer said, 'Did he find a car dealer?' I found many car dealers. In fact I released some correspondence overnight that shows that other car dealers were receiving as much, if not more, attention from the Treasury than Mr Grant. There were many car dealers receiving attention from the Treasury. That is the case. Built around this is a farrago of lies from those opposite about how these cases were being handled.One of the ones that is put around is that Mr Grant had personal updates sent to the Treasurer's fax. I just want to go through that one again, Mr Speaker, because there were something like 130 emails sent to my office by Mr Grech - 130 emails - and almost 30 per cent of those emails from Mr Grech to my office contained documents specifically for my attention. One of those did go to my home fax. Why? Because I happened to be at home. That is a remarkable thing to happen, isn't it, Mr Speaker? This year the office has sent 209 faxes to my home via email, a total of 1,487 pages, and since I have become Treasurer, 4,638 pages have been sent to my home fax. So let's just dispense with that.Of course there is also the notion that there is some conspiracy because some of the emails were copied to the Secretary of the Treasury. Mr Grech sent 131 emails to my office. Dr Henry was copied in to 82 of those emails. The next suggestion that we hear from those opposite is that Mr Grant received personal referrals to finance companies and that somehow he was the only person who received a personal referral to finance companies. I was talking to the MTAA only this morning and they were talking about the fact that many of their members -  -  - The fact is that Treasury officials were constantly putting car dealers in touch with car finance companies -  - and that is what was going on at the time. You can see that from the evidence from the head of Ford Credit at the Senate inquiry last Friday:Senator ABETZ - During those meetings, was the plight of any particular car dealer mentioned to you?Mr Cohen - Yes.Senator ABETZ - And how many?Mr Cohen - There are at least three or four that I can recall.And there would have been many more but I would not know of them because these were matters that were handled by the Treasury officials with the finance companies and with the car dealers. I simply would not know.The next allegation is that Mr Grant was looked after as a condition of rolling Ford Credit into OzCar. This is one of the biggest furphies of them all. Sloppy Joe over there has been trying to maintain that somehow Ford Credit was going to be a beneficiary of $500 million direct from the federal Treasury. Of course that was not the case at all. - I am talking about the allegations that the shadow Treasurer has been making about Ford Credit and how it relates to all of the dealerships that were dealt with by the Treasury. - It is a very pertinent question because it is very clear they could not care less what happened to car dealers right across the country during this period. The thing that OzCar was to do was to raise funds from the sale of securities to the major banks to provide liquidity for the financiers. The role the government was going to play in all of that was to offer a guarantee. But Sloppy Joe over there has been out there peddling his line -  - that somehow Ford Credit were up for a loan of $500 million, which of course they were not. - I am sure you do. -  - Many dealers were contacting members of parliament, many dealers were contacting their trade organisation, many dealers were contacting the Treasury directly, and many of those were being put in contact with car finance companies.In the House yesterday, I said I would follow up, through the Treasury, matters that were raised with me by two members of this House. I take those matters very seriously. I will take this matter seriously as well. I raised the two matters that were raised with me by members in this House yesterday with the Secretary to the Treasury today. He is looking at those matters and he will come back to me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. The member for Lindsay knows how important integrity in written material is because he was the victim of a fake pamphlet prior to the last election. In the modern age, the integrity of emails is just as important. That is why the Rudd government has marked National E-security Awareness Week. It began, very interestingly, just two weeks ago - two weeks ago, the day after the first question, based upon a fake email, was raised by those opposite, it was National E-Security Awareness Week. -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker -  - National E-security Awareness Week has some key lessons. As part of the material, its lessons for all computer users include:When dealing with email it is important to not just blindly follow attachments from unknown sources.That was part of the lessons that were out there in the National E-security Awareness Week promotional material for the general public. It also said:It is important to take a bit of care in trusting where the information came from.That is what the National E-security Awareness Week material said, just two weeks ago. Indeed, we launched an education module aimed at year 3 and year 9 students. There is no doubt that in the future it can be played in some of the new classrooms that we are building. We also produced a series of postcards. I commend to members of the House the website: www.staysmartonline.gov.au. The postcards say:What have you lost?Maybe the leadership! They also say:Protect yourself online.We even have the program 'Budd:e'. I table it for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, who may need one or two in coming days. Clearly, the opposition did not pay attention during National E-security Awareness Week, because what we have seen from the opposition is their reliance upon a fake email to call for the resignation of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The sorts of lessons that are being taught to kids in year 3 have not been learnt by those opposite, who are the alternative government of the nation.The contradictions, when it comes to the connections with Mr Grech and this email, are quite extraordinary. At 7.55 am today, the shadow Treasurer, when asked about the correspondence with Mr Grech over the last few months, said, 'Not to my knowledge.' At 8.05 am the Leader of the Opposition was asked on AM:Has anyone in the Opposition, to your knowledge, spoken to Mr Grech in the last few months apart from that conversation Joe Hockey said he had?The answer was:Well, I'm sure they have. I mean Mr Grech is very well known and I have certainly spoken to Mr Grech. - At 8.30 am the shadow Treasurer was out there saying, 'Of course they have spoken to him,' which was a remarkable turnaround. The concern that was there about this fake email that was so significant -  - There is a very clear lesson to be learnt from National E-security Week and that is about the integrity of emails. Another lesson is that you cannot delete them from your computers. There are other lessons there as well. The members of the opposition might bear that in mind and cooperate with the AFP investigation and make available the opposition's computers to that AFP investigation. It is very clear from the questions they have asked today that there is one other lesson they have not learnt, which is: when you are in a hole, stop digging.The member for Solomon then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - The first thing I will say to the member for Grey is that not every dealer sought a conversation. But I do know one thing: those dealers that contacted my office were dealt with promptly and appropriately -  - Of course they were not all dealt with by me you moron. - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Anybody who knows me and my political life knows that I have always endeavoured to deal as directly with constituents - The member for Swan then left the chamber. - I have always sought as a member of parliament and as a minister to deal as directly as I possibly can with people who have problems, and in this case there were lots of car dealers with some very big financial headaches and the employment of thousands of Australians was on the line. So, many, many people were calling my ministerial office, many people were calling the Treasury directly and many people were going through their industry organisation, and all of these things were being handled in the Treasury. As regards those that contacted my office, they were all forwarded on to the Treasury to be dealt with as quickly and as effectively as was possible. Certainly, many were. It is also the case that some dealerships may not have fitted the criteria for assistance that could have been provided either through OzCar or by existing finance companies. I am more than happy to follow up the details that the member for Grey has asked about, but the one thing that I can say is that the government and I, through all of these times, were motivated by one central factor, and that was to support the industry at a time of global financial crisis that was threatening jobs and threatening the supply chain right through to the auto manufacturers.This was a very serious situation. Many people thought that they were indeed probably going to lose their finance by March. That is what it was like in February and, as I indicated to the House the other day, the Prime Minister and other ministers and I spent a lot of time on this issue through that period - day after day working with the Treasury; day after day making sure that we could get OzCar up and running, knowing through all of the period while OzCar was not up and running the only option available to the Treasury, which was in receipt of the information about those financiers who were staying in the market and those dealers who might be without finance, was to work with them all. There were updates coming through to me through that period. Some did go to my home fax. Many went to my email tray in the office. It just depended on where I was. But, in relation to the ones that went to my home fax from Mr Grech, they simply went there because he hit 'reply all' to a communication from my office. That is why they ended up there. I never asked for them to be sent there - in the first instance - by Mr Grech because my office was using my home fax to put a lot of material through. I do not apologise for one minute for having sensitive material sent to my home fax, because during this period we were working right around the clock, not only on this issue but on many other issues. I do recall that, as we were doing this, we were opposed every inch of the way by those opposite. So not every car dealer sought a conversation, but I certainly hope that every car dealer that went through my office got the treatment they should have received through the Treasury.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. Misuse of public resources is of course a serious matter. With respect to investigation of any allegations of misuse of public resources, anybody who has any knowledge or any involvement or any connection with such alleged misuse has an obligation to make information available to investigating authorities to help clear up the matter.I would remind members of an investigation that is currently occurring with respect to an email, which has now been determined to be a fake email, that was, according to the Australian Federal Police, created on a Treasury computer and emailed from Treasury to the computer at the home of Mr Grech. Although it was subsequently deleted from the Treasury computer, the AFP was able to determine the origins of the email. In response to these extraordinary events, the government has been quite prepared to make available all of its computer records with respect to the inquiries that are proceeding - by both the Auditor-General and the Australian Federal Police - in order to ensure that they can complete their investigations and that they can get all of the available information that they can in order to determine whether any offences have been committed and, if so, by whom. Unfortunately, the opposition thus far have not agreed to make available their email and computer records to the inquiry by the Australian Federal Police in order to assist in the investigation of these matters in order to determine the origins of the email and any parties involved in its dissemination or in any way connected to the email and its dissemination more broadly.If you -  - I am not quite sure -  - All I have said is 'I am not quite sure'. Does that qualify for anything in particular? - I am not exactly sure what the opposition leader means by 'full cooperation' but if he has just made an undertaking to make all the opposition's computer records available for examination by the Australian Federal Police - For questions regarding persons:questions must not reflect on or be critical of the character or conduct of a Member, a Senator _There are other forms of this House to deal with that.An opposition member - Well done. -  YU5 
Tanner, Lindsay, MPMr TANNER - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I will not further speculate on what the Leader of the Opposition means by full cooperation, but I would in conclusion draw your attention to a few statements that have been made today by the Leader of the Opposition and by the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney. I note, for example, that when he was asked on Sunrise today whether he had ever seen the fake email the Leader of the Opposition said that he was 'not going to compromise the police investigation by answering that question'. I note also that there has been some confusion between the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney with respect to contacts that may have occurred between them and Mr Grech prior to the Senate hearing on Friday, which is when this matter first appeared in the public domain. I note, for example, that the shadow Treasurer stated on the doors, 'I'd imagine people in the opposition did have contact with Treasury officials,' in response to the question, 'Did you or anybody in the Liberal Party have contact with Mr Grech prior to his testimony?' Then the shadow Treasurer said: 'I would expect that this is the case. I don't want to compromise police investigations at all.' In other words, far from providing full cooperation, they are now using the existence of police investigations as an excuse to maintain a smokescreen and to refuse to answer questions about their knowledge of these matters. On Sunrise, the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, when asked what his knowledge of the email was, said:There's been talk about it around the place for ages. I heard it around the place. - No, I have not, Mr Speaker. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The fact remains that this email was first read into the public record by a frontbencher of the Liberal Party, Senator Abetz, and there has been a variety of media reports indicating that it had been hawked around the gallery prior to its first being put into the public domain. We have now got a variety of admissions - in some cases, contrasting admissions - from different leading figures in the opposition about their involvement here. Full cooperation should mean full cooperation and participation in full by delivering all computer records to the AFP. I note -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would remind the House in conclusion that what we are dealing with here is the fallout from an accusation made in public on Friday against the Prime Minister alleging that he was corrupt and that he had lied to the Australian people. That is what we are dealing with. I will read the quotation for you again, if you would like. That is what we are dealing with. I note, and his behaviour today is underlining it, that on 25 August 2008 the member for Warringah described the Leader of the Opposition thus:At his worst, Malcolm can be a bit of a volcano.That certainly says it all.</DOC>

 - I have said it here; I have said it publicly: I was approached by the member for Oxley and he said, 'Will you speak to Mr Grant?' I did, for about two minutes, and I referred him to a DLO. Through that period I was dealing with the problems and challenges in the industry. Many of those dealers were either contacting my office, contacting the Treasury directly or contacting the MTAA. I make no apology for talking to a small business person in an environment such as that - none at all. I do endeavour in my political life to speak to as many as I possibly can. I did speak to Mr Grant. And what I did do - and what the government - An opposition member - Just resign. - There we go - more of the smear, right across the table. The grubby smear campaign has been laid bare. - The grubby smear campaign was laid bare across the table again from the Leader of the Opposition to the Prime Minister. He went out there to smear the Prime Minister and myself on a baseless email, which he had been peddling around this building for weeks. He had been peddling it around for weeks - peddling it around the business community. -  - I do think the Leader of the Opposition, and the opposition as a whole, have got some very serious questions to answer, because they have been involved in a grubby smear campaign against the Prime Minister and myself and particularly my family. They have been very active in the last four or five days putting around their smears against the Prime Minister and myself. What has happened in the last few days is that the basis of that smear has now emerged - there has been a fake email, which the Leader of the Opposition -  - The fake email that the Leader of the Opposition has been using to smear the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is the fault of the Treasurer! Where does he get that logic? He has no credibility - no credibility whatsoever. All of this today is just to camouflage the very serious questions that each and every one of those frontbenchers over there needs to answer. Did any member of the opposition or their staff have an electronic or hard copy of the text of the email in their possession before Friday? Did any of them? When did any member of the opposition or their staff first see the text of the fake email? - There are questions that need to be answered. Did any members of the opposition or their staff have any contact with Mr Grech in the last two months, or did any recently departed staff have any contact with Mr Grech in the last two months? This goes to the core of the smear campaign that has been mounted by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for the question. Members would be aware that the latest climate projections are not good for many parts of Australia. To quote from the Bureau of Meteorology:In addition, many computer models, including the Bureau's POAMA, remain firm in their predictions of an El Nino event in 2009. This puts the odds of an El Nino at above 50%, which is more than double the normal risk of an event. However, it's still possible, though increasingly less likely, that the recent trends may stall without El Nino thresholds being reached.That weather projection carries with it a problem that we have dealt with in this parliament for many years, and that is: what to do about a shortage of water - what to do to deal with the fact that El Nino brings with it extraordinary shortages of rain, often when you need it most.There are a number of policies of the past that the government will not be considering. While we have decided to embark on the $300 million expense of improving on-farm infrastructure, we will not be providing the $5 million payment to upgrade the irrigation at Flemington Racecourse. Nor will we be adopting the policy that was used in the past of funding the Australian Rain Corporation. It takes a significant level of self-confidence when you are faced with a drought, to say, 'Well, I'll just tell it to rain,' but that's what the rainmaker sitting opposite at the table decided to do.Against advice that the Australian Rain Corporation 'have provided no convincing experimental data or theoretical modelling to support the proposed mode of operation of technology,' and despite the independent review then saying that there is 'no convincing evidence that the ATLANT technology operates as believed by its proponents', the Leader of the Opposition chose a different path.I have to say I think the Leader of the House and I have been unfair to the National Party. We have not given nearly enough attention to the outrageous abuse of public money by the Liberal Party and in particular, as a former minister, by the Leader of the Opposition, because what does he do when there is no legitimate data -  - This goes to one of the options for how to deal with the upcoming seasonal conditions and policy paths that have been used in the past, which is precisely what I was asked to refer to. If it is something that causes a deal of embarrassment to the Leader of the Opposition now, it is something that he was proud of in the lead-up to the election. What does he do when there is no legitimate data, no legitimate evidence? The same thing that he did when there was no legitimate email - there is no sense of caution; impatience takes over and he just presses the accelerator.The department recommended that at most there should be a $2 million trial. So what did he provide in response to a recommendation for a $2 million trial? Ten million dollars - on the very same day the election was called, and he writes to the former Prime Minister seeking the money. And who did he do it for? One of his neighbours who was an executive of the Australian Rain Corporation, the same neighbour who was a member of the election fundraising committee known as the Wentworth Forum, with membership set at $5,000 just to get into the room. Every time you hear the confected outrage -  - Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. I will sum up, because it is interesting that what was just described in that point of order as a grubby smear is something that moments ago the Leader of the Opposition said he was not a bit ashamed of. And there is a reason for that. Last night on the 7.30 Report, he said he had never accused the Prime Minister of corruption, and yet last Friday he said:The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have used their offices and taxpayers' resources to seek advantage for one of their mates _The reason he does not believe that that is corruption is that he actually did it, and he did it with real public money, turning $2 million into $10 million.</DOC>

 - Here we go again with this fantastic exaggeration and smear. The fact is that my office did receive updates -  - and they were regular, they were when I was in the office and they went into my in-tray. That is where they go. When I am home, they may go to my home fax. I do not know what the work ethic of the shadow Treasurer was when he was a minister, but, going by the laughter we heard yesterday when it was suggested that sending a fax to my home at 5.15 was some extreme event, I think that we can take it that they did not work weekends. I think we can take that. But this government does work hard and things are sent to the home fax.I went through the fact before that Mr Grech sent some faxes to my home fax which were not invited because he hit 'reply all'. The opposition seek to distort that fact. In fact, my departmental liaison officer went to some lengths to say to Mr Grech not to send faxes to my home - and that is on the public record for anybody to see. But, through my office, by phone, by email and by other contact there were numerous contacts with car dealers and the industry over a long period of time - and of course not all of them are documented, like they are documented in email. Nevertheless, that was what was going on through the period.Those opposite simply do not understand the nature of the challenge that this country is facing. They do not understand what was going on during that period and so, as a consequence, cannot conceive that there was a huge volume of activity -  - It does not matter whether it went to my home or whether it went to the in-tray in my office or whether I met them out on the road in an electorate. There was a huge volume of email. I have detailed the nature of that email. I have detailed the 130-odd emails from Mr Grech. Only a handful of those were concerned with Mr Grant. So there must have been a lot, an enormous amount, and one or two did go to my home fax. That signifies absolutely nothing whatsoever. You see, they are so acutely embarrassed by their current circumstances, having hawked a fake email around the top end of town for weeks -  - It's my fault again? The email is the fault of the government? He has been smearing the government -  - The Leader of the Opposition has yet again demonstrated to this House that he is unfit for the office he holds and he should resign.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question. The government is seeking to amend the Electoral Act in a number of ways to strengthen scrutiny and probity in Australia's electoral system. Those reforms include requiring disclosure of any donations above a $1,000 limit and banning donations to political parties by foreigners. Sadly, the Liberal and National parties have been obstructing these very important reforms to political transparency and probity in this country in the Senate, which is very unfortunate. It is very unfortunate for the integrity of our democratic process.It is worth noting that there are recent examples of particular kinds of donations that would be affected by these changes. I draw members' attention to an article in the Sunday Age, dated 8 February this year, headed 'Turnbull takes cash from market 'vulture'' and written by Josh Gordon. I would like to quote a couple of sentences from this article:MALCOLM Turnbull has taken a large campaign donation from an American billionaire closely linked to the predatory lending practices that triggered the subprime lending crisis - in the United States and the global recession. It goes on:An investigation _ revealed that Peter Briger, chairman and director of controversial 'vulture company' Fortress Investment Group, contributed $US50,000 - or A$76,000 - to the Liberal campaign fund for the Opposition leader's seat of Wentworth last year.The article then goes on to say that a 'vulture' company is a company which preys on the carcass of dead or distressed companies. In fact, this particular vulture company was deemed to be so aggressive that even the Wall Street Journal attacked the company for foreclosing on families who were affected in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. An interesting addendum to this article is that a search of the register of members' interests revealed that on 14 March 2007 the Leader of the Opposition disclosed that he owned shares in the Fortress Investment Group and that this shareholding remained until 27 July 2007. According to the article he received a donation of $76,000 from this company during 2007 at some point - which does raise the interesting possibility that he was on both sides of the transaction, although it is not clear from the indications as to whether or not that is the case. -  - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. People who peddle the kinds of accusations that the Leader of the Opposition made against the Prime Minister on Friday, and who then claim to be the great defenders of integrity and probity in public life, should not be blocking the government's reforms to electoral laws as the opposition are doing in the Senate. These reforms are extremely important for the probity and transparency of our political system. They are very important for ensuring that the electoral system functions in an open and genuine way in the future - The member for Oxley then left the chamber. - I will conclude by drawing the attention of the House again to the glaring contradiction in the positions being taken by the opposition in their willingness to accuse the Prime Minister of corruption on the basis of a fake email, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever, and at the same time their resisting the government's attempts to improve the quality, transparency and probity of Australian politics by reforming the Electoral Act and the laws regarding disclosure of political donations and donations by foreigners. So I suggest to the opposition that they clean up their act. They should stand up here and say that they will fully cooperate with the AFP inquiry and disclose all of their computer records to the inquiry, that they will pass the Electoral Act reforms and that the Leader of the Opposition should resign.</DOC>

 - This is a continuation of the smear campaign against the Prime Minister and me because it is a fact that Mr Grant received no special assistance and received no special benefit whatsoever - zero. We took the same steps to assist him as we took to assist other car dealers and certainly in some cases the evidence indicates much more effort went into those cases. That was the situation at the time because, as I said, it was a difficult time. This is what Mr Delaney had to say the other morning:There is $8 billion worth of car plan financing used every year. There was a prospect that 50 per cent of it had just disappeared. - A number of car dealers were in distress so they were phoning - Opposition members - No! - They weren't? Is that the case? A number of car dealers were not in distress? You do not recognise the problem - I gather that! - We heard what Mr Delaney had to say about all this yesterday. He said:The treatment that Mr Grant, a member of mine, got was no different from the treatment all of my other members got on my intervention on their behalf to Mr Grech. They were all treated in the same way, and for the same good reason: there was no other way to do these things. In fact I think Mr Grant has been treated less well because he went to the Treasurer.That is what Mr Delaney had to say. Mr Delaney was working very closely with the Treasury. Mr Delaney was working very closely with Mr Grech. Many dealers were dealing directly with the Treasury, including with Mr Grech. The documentation is out there which shows that many of those, or some of those, were receiving an enormous amount of assistance. We have heard that the head of Ford Credit had indicated that they were dealing, through the Treasury, with those who were looking for finance. So all of this is just a huge concoction. It is all part of the smear campaign that is being conducted against the Prime Minister and me. Now that the Leader of the Opposition has found himself in the position of being exposed as the architect of that smear campaign -  - No. - What I actually said was two faxes - yet another example of the smear and the misrepresentation that those opposite have engaged in from day one over this issue because they are just so desperate. They have demonstrated in this House just how unfit for government they are. At the height of a global financial crisis they have not one single positive policy alternative for this country. All they want to do is play the politics of fear and smear because they do not have any positive alternatives for Australia. The Leader of the Opposition ought to resign.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. People on this side of the House will be delighted to know - in fact, all will be aware of this because of being in the chamber last night voting for it - the alcopops measure has now passed the House. Although, I am disappointed to say that it was despite the announcement that was rather gracelessly executed by the member for Dickson that the Liberal Party was going to support the measure. I think he indicated that the Leader of the Opposition had finally had his way over the member for Dickson and the rest of the shadow cabinet. He declared that support would be provided by the Liberal Party for this measure. Actually, when it came to it, there were no Liberal members in the chamber voting for this measure. In fact, there were four members of the coalition parties here voting against the measure.I have to admit to feeling slightly sorry - and probably not for the reasons that other people in the country might be feeling sorry - for the Leader of the Opposition, who was finally able to say that he saw the merit of our arguments for the alcopops and it was a matter worthy of supporting. He said, 'Come on troops, we're going to vote for it,' and he turned around and suddenly there was nobody standing there behind him. For 12 months they have been arguing against this measure. It seems to me that the Liberal Party are fine if they are against something. But if you want them to support something, they split in all directions. We have the member for O'Connor, the member for Hume and the member for Gippsland who, after all the love that was shown to him by the distilling industry during his by-election, obviously could not bring himself to vote against the measure. They actually ran an advertising campaign for him during his by-election. - There is not very much love in this House. But to suggest that there is a bit of love between the distilling industry -  - Order! The minister will resume her seat. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I understand why the member for McMillan feels left out. It is, of course, because his advertising campaign was not funded by the distillers, but the member for Gippsland had advertising right through the whole by-election paid for by the distillers. - Of course I do understand why this is sensitive for the National Party. The Leader of the National Party in the Senate, despite the announcement of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for health, has said that he will not be voting for this measure. The Leader of the Opposition is running a rabble on the other side of the House. They have argued against this measure for 12 months. Finally, they have agreed that there is merit and that this measure should be passed and then he cannot control the people in his team. When he says. 'It's time for us to support this measure,' he has the leader in the Senate saying that he will not; he has members scattered across this chamber who will not follow his leadership. As I said, I confess to feeling slightly sorry for the Leader of the Opposition. When he actually decides to support somebody, there is nobody there standing behind him.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Chisholm for her question. Members will be aware that there has indeed been a great deal of misinformation and misreporting about the Building the Education Revolution project, with those on the other side making some hysterical complaints about inflated costs for projects. I know that the member for Paterson certainly voted against investment in his local schools, but I also know that he claims to have a particular interest in Bobs Farm Public School in his electorate. During Senate estimates, Senator Mason raised the issue of Bobs Farm Public School getting a quote for a new classroom for less than $150,000 when the New South Wales department of education quoted a higher price. As we have come to expect, those opposite did not check the facts. They just went out there and made claims and did not check the facts. Actually, it was reported in the media without a checking of the facts as well.I want to help out, because I have got a copy of the quote that the school received right here. It is dated 30 March 2009 from Australian Portable Buildings for $122,000 for a classroom. As a diligent person acting for the Deputy Prime Minister in the portfolio representing her in the chamber, I wanted to make sure that I checked the facts, because we know that the Minister for Education always checks her facts before she makes any statements before this House. I wanted to know what standard of facility the member for Paterson believes that students at Bobs Farm Public School - not named after him, I must say - should have access to. The quote for a portable classroom of $122,000 leaves a bit out. The quote does not include carpet, heating and cooling, foundations or a ceiling that meets fire safety requirements. There is no furniture, no connection to the sewerage system or stormwater drains or electricity. There is no site preparation - for example, for demolition or sloping work. - There is more missing: it had no railing on the balcony to stop kids falling off; it had no structural or design engineering certifications; it had no fencing safety or security of the site. A terrific quote, this one, for the member for Patterson to go out there and say, 'This alternative quote is the way to go. This is the way that we can save taxpayers' money by going down this road.' But if that did not raise enough questions, on the quote it finishes:We recommend that all portable buildings be tied down.It was a tent, not a classroom! They recommended that it be tied down. Once all necessary inclusions were taken into account the New South Wales department of education estimated that the price would increase to $357,000 more than the price that the department was quoting for a similar building.So I say to those opposite, whether it is emails, whether it is the running down of our education infrastructure projects, whether it is the running down of our rail and road infrastructure projects or our community infrastructure projects through local government: check the facts, compare the quotes, because when you are looking at building infrastructure in our schools for our children, we simply cannot cut corners nor should we take anything for granted.</DOC>

 - To begin with, I covered these details before. I quoted the head of Ford Credit about a meeting he held with the Treasury where he said in the testimony last Friday that three or four companies to his knowledge were put in contact with the finance companies. The means by which these occurred - whether it was phone numbers, emails - I do not know, because I was not there. But I do know from talking to others that there were a large number of contacts facilitated between the Treasury and a significant number of dealers. Whether that was done by mobile phone numbers, whether it was done by email, I do not know. The reason I do not know is very simple, and it goes to the core of the exaggeration and the misrepresentation of those opposite. The exaggeration and misrepresentation of those opposite goes to this fact: it was the Treasury that was dealing with the finance companies and it was the Treasury that was dealing with the car dealers. They were handling those relationships. There was not a role that was played in there by the government.That has been outlined at length by me - and indeed it was also outlined to some extent last Friday. Of course it can be outlined at length by organisations that were involved in those discussions and most particularly the Motor Trades Association of Australia, which was very much at the centre of putting its dealers in contact with the Treasury. So to suggest that I would have any knowledge of that at all is just indicative of how desperate those opposite have become. It is utterly desperate to say that some contact with a dealer somehow indicates some special benefit when all of the evidence indicates there was no special outcome and when these matters were dealt with entirely appropriately in the same way as other dealers were dealt with in the Treasury. That is what all the evidence indicates.But they have not let go of this, because they have to continue to exaggerate; they have to continue to misrepresent. Why do they have to do that? To continue the smear based in the very first instance on a false email to make the most damning allegation that can be made against a political leader in any country in the world: that somehow he and his Treasurer are corrupt. That is what this desperate man who sits opposite did. He went out and did that, and it all turned to smoke yesterday. So what we are seeing in the House today is some attempt to misrepresent, some attempt to exaggerate, some attempt to try and retrieve some lost political ground. - The question related to the grubby opportunism of those opposite. That is what it related to. We have an opposition leader who is in so much trouble and is so desperate he went out today and claimed I was responsible for the creation of a fake email. How desperate can you get? He has no integrity, he has absolutely no credibility and those opposite should really bury this grubby opportunist and get rid of him as soon as possible.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. The country at present is wrestling with many global challenges. The global economic recession is one of them. Here at home we are seeking to build the education revolution to make sure that our young people have the best chances for tomorrow. We are investing in our health and hospital system to make sure that we can build a better healthcare system against global standards. We are ensuring that we are acting to close the gap with Indigenous Australians. And we are also wrestling with the huge challenge of climate change, a challenge which I think all fair-minded Australians would agree was entirely ignored by those opposite in the 12 years in which they were in office. Those opposite refused even step 1, which was to ratify the Kyoto Protocol - the entry point in dealing with this matter internationally, and they could not bring themselves to the post.The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation is important, not only in terms of Australia playing its part in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, but also for business certainty and the economy. That is why you have statements from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Climate Institute, Pacific Hydro, the Ai Group, the Business Council of Australia, BP Australasia's president, as well as Shell's chairman all talking about the need for one core thing on climate change and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme - that is, certainty for the business environment. Calls for example that said, 'We call on the Australian parliament to ensure passage of both the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and RET this year to make sure it happens, to ensure also that we have certainty for business.'That is why the government have worked hard to have this legislation prepared for the parliament. That is why we have introduced legislation and why we are expecting this legislation to be dealt with in the Senate. But I am advised today that what has happened in the Senate is that the opposition have reordered government business in the Senate to push the CPRS back. They have such strength of leadership that they have now resolved to vote not to vote. It goes to the absolute shambles that the opposition now find themselves in. There is an absence of leadership on something as basic as alcopops: they cannot even present themselves to vote and they are disunited on that as well. There is an absolute lack of unity on the question of climate change and the CPRS and the RET. They cannot unite themselves even to bring on a vote, for the simple reason that they fear they will split right down the middle. There is an absence of leadership also in the handling of the matter which is before the parliament now. That matter before the parliament now goes to this email scandal.We have had I believe a debate in this place in recent days about honesty in public life. This is an important debate. It goes to the integrity of leadership. It is one which the entire parliament should be seized with and engaged in. It is basic to all of our engagements in public life. Mr Speaker, I would have thought -  - Mr Speaker, it might be challenging to some of those opposite, but the question actually went to the importance of honesty in national political life and national leadership. I would draw the acting manager of opposition business's attention to the actual text of the question. In terms of the honesty which is at stake in this debate on this fake email affair, I draw the House's attention to some of the things which have been said in pursuit of honesty in this House today by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition today has said he has never accused - he said it in public today, he may have said it in the House as well - myself or the Treasurer of corruption. Mr Speaker, let me read to you what he said in his press conference on 19 June. He said:The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have used their offices and taxpayers' resources to seek advantage for one of their mates and then lied about it to the Parliament.Mr Speaker, what form of language and interpretation can be used in relation to a statement like that, other than to say that it is an accusation of corruption? Any fair-minded person would reach that conclusion.Can I also say that on the question of the handling of this matter since the events of yesterday, again on the question of honesty, those opposite sought in recent times to say that Senator Abetz in the Senate only raised the question of the contents of this fake email after it appeared in the Daily Telegraph. Yesterday those opposite could not even get their stories straight. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - who intently avoids my gaze - said that in fact the only reason Senator Abetz raised this -  -  - Mr Speaker, what a tangled web they weave. Both the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that Senator Abetz raised this matter in the Senate because it was in the Daily Telegraph. They made those statements about Senator Abetz's testimony to the Senate, or his presentation to the Senate on Friday. These matters did not appear in the Telegraph until Saturday. On the question of honesty in public life, I would suggest that those opposite might reflect on that as well.Then, of course, we had this extraordinary concoction in the papers yesterday, with the Leader of the Opposition again using his journalist of choice from the Australian, Mr Milne, to reflect and to provide a briefing concerning the accuracy of the recorded conversation involving Dr Charlton. The core of it is this: the Leader of the Opposition in that briefing said as follows: he did not approach Dr Charlton; Dr Charlton approached him. Yet we had Malcolm Farr in the Daily Telegraph providing a simultaneous account of what occurred before adding, 'The Leader of the Opposition was seeking out Dr Charlton and approached him.' Again, what a tangled web those opposite weave on the question of honesty.Can I say also that the most extraordinary thing that I have seen so far in this debate is the accusation today that this entire false, fake, forged email affair is somehow the fault of the government. The silence on the part of those opposite sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition says it all - the stunned silence of his backbench. For this Leader of the Opposition to have mounted a campaign against my integrity and that of the Treasurer over recent times on the basis of a forged, fake, false email and then, when it is found out, to turn around and say that he has no responsibility for this but that it is the fault and responsibility of the government says how detached from reality he has become.I say to the honourable member for Bradfield and, in his absence, the member for Higgins - the senior statesmen of the Liberal Party: tap this man on the shoulder. He must resign. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. - </DOC>

 - I, as Prime Minister, have absolute confidence in the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia. I say that in the full confidence that those sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition today have passing and fading confidence in him. We have here a Leader of the Opposition who stands in this chamber in a state of denial, as if somehow the events of this week have simply not happened, they have just passed by, they are of no consequence whatsoever and it is all simply a bad dream that will go away. I have something to say to the Leader of the Opposition: this is not a bad dream that will just go away; it is a nightmare and it will not go away. It goes to the future of the Leader of the Opposition's tenuous hold on his position in this place.I say to the Leader of the Opposition as he continues on this particular matter that if he wants to look carefully at the consequences for himself they go to two matters: (1) his entire integrity has been shattered by this process and (2) his authority within his own party has been equally undermined and shattered as well - as seen by three sets of policy splits across the coalition. There have been three major matters before this parliament where he cannot even command the unity of his party.I also say to the Leader of the Opposition, who was asked about this matter this morning: if we need some sort of bellwether as to how things are going over that side of the House on this matter we need look no further than the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer. Let us look at what the member for North Sydney had to say when asked about the question of responsibility for this tawdry forged email affair. The member for North Sydney was asked last night by Tony Jones the following question:So, the buck does not stop with Malcolm Turnbull for what is being identified by many people as a tactical blunder and a disaster.Joe Hockey's response:Well, you know what, Tony, I'm part of a team. I mean you don't always agree with the individual decisions that are made by the individual players in the team.That is what I call 100 per cent loyalty! -  - He doth protest too much. Later in the interview, having given such an unqualified statement of loyalty to the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for North Sydney was asked by Tony Jones -  - The question I was asked concerned my confidence in the Treasurer. I affirmed that in my opening statement in response to this question. The member for North Sydney, who desperately does not want to hear this, was asked another question by Tony Jones last night. Jones said:This is what Mr Turnbull said on AM this morning: 'I've certainly spoken to Mr Grech, I know Mr Grech.'That is the attribution to the Leader of the Opposition. Jones asked:It is still unclear, though, what he spoke to him about. Do you, Mr Hockey, know what that was about?Joe Hockey's answer was this - another unqualified statement of solidarity and support:Well, that's a matter for Malcolm Turnbull and Godwin Grech, isn't it?That is what I would call 100 per cent loyalty! You know that if you are in a scrap you would want the member for North Sydney standing loyally behind you. What a rock solid wall of defence he represents!On this matter, not only has the integrity - that which remains - of the Leader of the Opposition been fundamentally shattered by this forged email affair; on top of that his authority within the Liberal Party has been destroyed. On three major matters before this parliament, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, alcopops and immigration policy, his authority is so undermined he cannot even unite his party and unite the coalition in a single vote - and they are so desperate on the CPRS that they voted in the Senate to avoid voting. I say to those opposite who raise these matters that the Leader of the Opposition's integrity has disappeared; his authority has disappeared. There is one reasonable thing for him to do under these circumstances: to stand, to apologise and to resign.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Franklin for her question because on the weekend I announced principles to assist many people who are borrowing who may be impacted upon by the global recession. As we know, the Australian economy is being hit by the global recession - the worst event in something like 75 years. In the middle of this, we are doing better than any other advanced economy and we are working hard to stimulate the economy and to support jobs. In fact, the impact of our stimulus means that up to 210,000 more Australians have a job than would have been the case without our economic stimulus. Regrettably, unemployment will increase, which is why we do need to take steps to support Australians who, through no fault of their own, may become unemployed as a result of the global recession. This is why I was so pleased on the weekend to announce that all of the 144 retail banks, building societies and credit unions who focus on the mortgage market have signed up to principles to assist borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty as a result of the global recession.These principles will ensure that families are treated fairly when they are finding it difficult to pay off their loan. Options for assisting borrowers in distress include postponement for up to 12 months of the dates on which payments are due under a mortgage contract, an extension of the period of the contract and a reduction in the amount of each payment due under the contract, interest-only breaks on loan repayments and, of course, fee waivers. If people do not think they are getting a fair go from their bank or their building society, they can seek assistance from the Financial Ombudsman Service.These are practical measures to support Australian families at a time when we are being impacted upon so savagely by a global recession. We on this side of the House understand the importance of supporting families and the importance of supporting businesses, unlike those on the other side of the House, who can only throw mud.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, this desperate Leader of the Opposition is grasping at straws. This is desperation with a capital D. It goes to a matter concerning not Mr Grant but another car dealer with whom I have no relationship whatsoever. Can I simply say to the honourable member that, at the time I answered his question, I was unaware of what outcome had occurred in relation to that car dealer, and I stand by the statement that I made at that time.Can I say to the honourable member, again in his state of continuing denial, that he seems to think that all that is going on in the national debate today about his integrity will just fade away, that it is of no continuing relevance. This entire debate has been about the truthfulness of the honourable gentleman opposite. It goes to the truthfulness of his handling not just of this affair before the events of last week; it goes also to something more fundamental - his handling of the events during this week.I ask honourable members to reflect on this - the whole question of truth. Is it true when he has claimed that he has made, for example, as he has said in recent days, no accusation of corruption in relation to me? That is false. Is it true when he says that he has never accused me of misleading the parliament? That is false. Mr Speaker, can I say to you: is it true when he says that he has never called for my resignation? Mr Speaker, that is false. Is it true when he claims that Senator Abetz only raised this matter in the Senate after the Daily Telegraph reported the contents of this forged email? That was false, as it was for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as well. Is it true when he says that he did not approach Dr Charlton but that Dr Charlton had approached him? That is false as well, as attested by a journalist who is of some respect and standing in the gallery - Mr Farr of the Daily Telegraph.What is the truth, therefore, about the content, the intensity and the appropriateness of the contact between this Leader of the Opposition and the public servants in question? He refuses to answer those questions. I believe, therefore, that these matters have yet to be fully established. What we do know, however, as an absolute fact is that the email upon which he has based his entire attack on my integrity is a forgery; it is false; it is simply a non basis in fact. Mr Speaker, can I say to those opposite, in particular to the Leader of the Opposition -  - Again, Mr Speaker, in the initial response to the question, I dealt with the matters which had been raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: this entire debate hangs on his credibility to continue in his position. I would say to the member for Bradfield and, in his absence, the member for Higgins: if the Leader of the Opposition does not have the integrity to stand and say that he accepts full responsibility for this entire debacle and to do the decent thing, which is to stand, to apologise and to resign, it is time that those behind him of seniority in the Liberal Party tapped him on the shoulder and told him to his face to do the honourable thing, which is to resign.</DOC>

 - The government, in dealing with the global challenges we face on the economy, on climate change and on other matters, has been active in prosecuting an activist agenda. Yesterday, I briefed the House on the implementation of the Building the Education Revolution program, visiting a school in Wanniassa here in Canberra and looking firsthand at what was happening with the building of new classrooms and the extension of the library to benefit an independent Christian school with a school population of about 1,100 or 1,200 young Australians. This is something of which this side of the House is proud. We are engaged with the real challenge which Australian families are facing right now, which is, 'How do we ensure that we have the best education facilities for our children for the future?'One of the other challenges for the future, of course, is climate change, and I would draw the attention of honourable members in the House to the Climate change: global risks, challenges and decisions report, which was released last week. This is a significant document. This was the most significant update of climate science since the 2007 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. This report underscores the urgency for action on climate change and it says:The newest evidence indicates that society faces serious risks even with a global temperature rise of only about 2 degrees. If society wants to minimize these risks, then action must be taken now. - I beg your pardon? - The interjection from the honourable member is that temperatures have dropped. There we have the climate change sceptics, represented by those opposite, again pointing to the absolute collapse in the authority of the Leader of the Opposition. We are engaged here in a debate about how you bring down greenhouse gas emissions and how you actually do that in a balanced way to support the economy. That is what we have incorporated in the principles of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. On the most basic science which causes us to act in this direction, we have an interjection from this extraordinary member of the opposition today - extraordinary in terms of, can I say, departure from any form of scientific fact. It is right up there with those members who want to put shadecloth in space or over the roof. -  - So undermined has the authority of the Leader of the Opposition become that, even in a debate on this matter today when the CPRS is before the Senate, we have an interjection from Liberal members opposite saying temperatures have gone down. Where is the basic consensus on the part of those opposite that we have a problem to deal with? They are still saying, as of 2009, there is not a problem. Does this not explain why for 12 years they failed to do anything? I return to the content -  - Oh, another interjection, from the member for Groom! - The interjection from the member for Groom, an old mate of mine from Queensland, was that they did act on climate change: they spent $3 million. Or did he say billion? I correct what I said; I did not quite hear him. I would draw the House's attention to this fact: in 12 years in office did they ever ratify the Kyoto protocol? Government members - No! - Did they ever develop an emissions trading scheme? Government members - No! - Did they ever legislate an emissions trading scheme? Government members - No! - Did they ever increase the renewable energy target? Government members - No! - Did they ever do anything of substance on climate change at all? 
Government members - No! - That is the record of the Liberal Party - oh, and the National Party. - Another climate change sceptic, the member for Goldstein, interjects. He is the leader of - what group on this? He seems to be flipping and flopping a bit. Is he with the climate change sceptics sitting on the fence or perhaps he is harbouring some form of leadership aspiration himself? You have to keep all camps in this debate under control. - I draw honourable members' attention to the content of this important new report - and again for the benefit of the honourable member up the back, who seems to dispute the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientists - which says as follows:The newest evidence indicates that society faces serious risks even with a global temperature rise of only about 2 degrees. If society wants to minimize these risks, then action must be taken now.The chair of the committee, Professor Richardson, said:Society has all the tools necessary to respond to climate change.And most poignantly, Professor Richardson -  - Mr Speaker, I find it remarkable that in this day and age they can still be disputing the basic science as to why we must act on climate change. What has happened to the authority of the Leader of the Opposition that, in a debate like this, there is simply open slather to those behind him to interject that it is all nonsense, that climate change is not a problem and that there should be no policy response. Most poignantly, Professor Richardson concludes her report by saying:The major ingredient missing is political will.Have we seen that in spades in terms of the participation by those opposite in this debate this morning? The business community in Australia is calling for action. The BCA said last week:The Liberal and National parties have never been totally clear with us about what their position was, and it's still not clear to us _ - Mr Speaker, is it any wonder that the acting Manager of Opposition Business is jumping up so much, because I understand around the corridors he is whispering of leadership aspirations still. In fact on 16 June - I think Tony likes this bit - the member said as follows:INTERVIEWER: And do you still have leadership aspirations down the track?TONY ABBOTT: Oh, down the track but a long, long way down the track.That is what I call a definitive response in politics. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I thank very much the member for Mosman for his interjection given that, I understand, that is currently his place of abode. - The member for the other part of Sydney he apparently seeks to represent in this place. That is fine, Mr Speaker. The business community -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I take the interjection from the acting Manager of Opposition Business, representing the interests of his constituent, who has just provided the intervention referred to. -  - Well, it is good to see honourable members doing their work. - The chairman of Xstrata, Mr Peter Coates, said the following in terms of climate change and the policy of those opposite. He said the coalition was:_ perceived to have no position on the ETS other than putting it off until next year _So said Peter Coates, chairman of Xstrata, on 19 June. What you have is the business community alert to what is occurring - that is, those opposite are so disunited on climate change that their one unifying call is this: whatever we do in the Senate, let's all agree on putting off the vote for as long as possible, because having such a vote will expose the absolute depths of the divisions which exist within our ranks.Again this comes back to the state of the leadership which exists within the opposition today. Australia wants business certainty and regulatory certainty on the future of climate change. What is impeding that? A failure of leadership on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to bring about unity on his side on which way they will vote. If they simply want to vote against it, have the vote - conduct it -  then we would at least know where they stand. But to have no vote at all is the ultimate demonstration of political cowardice, the ultimate demonstration of a lack of political ticker, the ultimate demonstration of a failure of leadership. We know why that is the case: because this leader's authority within his own ranks has collapsed, as has his credibility and integrity in the eyes of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - Thank you to the member for Braddon for the question. While the opposition have been preoccupied in recent days with a smear campaign about a fake email that has blown up in their face, the government have been endeavouring to get on with meeting the challenge of climate change. The legislation is in the Senate and we are being confronted by delay while the coalition have been obsessing about a fake email and engaging in a personal smear campaign against the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The fact of the matter is that, on this policy issue, the coalition are paralysed by division and by indecision. They cannot make their minds up and present a unified position on the issue of climate change and the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation. And it has to be recalled that, under 12 years of the Howard government, no action was taken on this issue despite countless reports. They refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Despite all of the evidence and the work that has been done by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the coalition are still divided.We only need to go to some of the comments on the record by the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the coalition on this important issue. The Leader of the Opposition, in his then capacity in the Howard government, said the following about the climate change science:This report - in reference to the fourth assessment report of the IPCC - presents a snapshot of the peer reviewed climate change science and confirms that human activity is causing global warming.This is an important recognition of the science in that report. We have heard an interjection from the member for Tangney in response to the answer given earlier by the Prime Minister. The member for Tangney said this year, in relation to this same issue, on the science:'Global warming' has been exposed as a massive fraud which the public has been duped into believing _The simple fact is that there is no 'global warming' of the kind claimed by the federal government and its cheerleaders in the green lobby _Now we have had the Leader of the Opposition acknowledge and respect the science of the IPCC report and the member for Tangney completely repudiate it and call it a fraud. Of course, Senator Abetz is still on the record; he has never repudiated the fact that he has claimed that weeds are a bigger threat than climate change. He is worried about Paterson's curse and lantana being a bigger threat than climate change. Senator Cash of the coalition also does not believe that the science is settled, and put it on the record in a minority report of a Senate committee. There are other members of the coalition on the record as sceptics about the climate science: the member for Dickson, a climate change sceptic; the member for Calare, a climate change sceptic; the member for Kalgoorlie, a climate change sceptic; the member for Cowper, a climate change sceptic. No denials; none of them accept the science.It is little wonder, in these circumstances, that not only are those opposite divided about the science and incapable of coming to a position but they also cannot agree on what to do about it. So it is little wonder that there is no unity in the coalition about the issue of emissions trading. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 31 May in relation to this issue:The world is moving very solidly in the direction of emissions trading schemes, most notably the Americans. So yes - said the Leader of the Opposition - I've got no doubt we will have an emissions trading scheme in Australia. That's my view.That is a very important statement from the Leader of the Opposition. Can he deliver on it? Can he deliver a position from the coalition on this issue? Take the commentary from Senator Bernardi, also in May of this year and representing the view of the coalition, in the light of this observation that the Leader of the Opposition has made. This is what Senator Bernardi said on radio in South Australia:The coalition's position is we will be opposing this emissions trading scheme.That is the statement of the -  - What is clearly in evidence is the division of the coalition over the greatest - the most important - economic and environmental reform that this country faces. We cannot get a united position from the coalition - not a single constructive proposal. Their division is holding the Australian community captive with respect to its ability to respond, through the Australian government, and to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to reduce our emissions and to play a constructive role in the strongest possible way in international negotiations late this year. The coalition are frustrating the Australian government's capacity to properly pursue what we were elected to pursue, and that is the taking of strong action on climate change. The coalition need to take responsibility on this important issue. The Leader of the Opposition needs to unify the coalition or stand aside on this issue. The Australian government must be able to go to Copenhagen this year upon the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and the business community, environmental groups and the Australian community demand that the coalition take responsibility.</DOC>

 - Every time the shadow Treasurer gets up and asks questions like that in this House, he just reminds the Australian people that the coalition has got no plans for jobs and no plans for the economy - none whatsoever. The emails that he is quoting from are emails that were released and which prove a very simple point: that Mr Grant received support, just like many other car dealers received support.But it is certainly the case that there are questions that do need to be asked and answered here. Those questions relate to the role of the Leader of the Opposition and the role of the shadow Treasurer in their relationship with Mr Grech and the pressure they may have put him under.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. In the entire time that I have been in this House, I have never seen a motion to suspend standing orders during question time greeted with such silence from the opposition leader's own side -  -  - because they know what he does not know himself. I understand that the member for Wentworth knows a dead cat when he sees one, but this one has got no bounce.On Monday, we interrupted the government's legislative agenda for 5½ hours. Those opposite did not seek to move, at 12 o'clock, when invited to by the government, a censure motion. That was at a time when they were still saying that the fake email was real. Two days later, when they know it is a fake, they come in here and move a suspension of standing and sessional orders for a censure motion. What an extraordinary position. I understand that their tactics committee met until 1.30 this morning. It has become a conference. When I turned on the television to watch Sky News this morning I had to check what I was watching. There was Kieran Gilbert in the studio, interviewing the Leader of the Opposition. But watching the Leader of the Opposition I could have sworn I was witnessing the ghost of Mark Latham. It was all there: the jaw jutting out, all the fake aggression, all the machismo, all the 'we're going well'! We used to hear it. We used to hear, 'It's all going well!' - There is someone who knows about boxing! The fact is that this government does have a big legislative agenda. I understand why those opposite want to move suspensions of standing orders - because they have no questions. They have no questions. Why else? When was the last time a suspension was moved after three questions? When was the last time?An opposition member - Four. - Three questions. They cannot even count. After three questions, they moved to shut question time down, because all they have got is a fake email - that is all they have got - and they have had a shocker of a week with this reincarnation of Mark Latham opposite here. Cab drivers are nervous! Lucky we have Comcar. Mr Speaker - </DOC>

 - I stand behind all of my previous statements to this House 100 per cent. I stand by all of those statements. What is going on here is a massive smear campaign against the Prime Minister and myself and there is a continuance of that in the House today. You know the Leader of the Opposition is going bad when the member for North Sydney cuts him loose. And of course that is what he did on Lateline last night. He was asked a question by Tony Jones -  - The Leader of the Opposition is just swinging in the breeze. This is what the shadow Treasurer said on Lateline last night:You know what, Tony? I'm part of a team. I mean, you don't always agree with individual decisions that are made by individual players in the team _Distancing himself from the Leader of the Opposition - swinging in the breeze! - The reason the Leader of the Opposition is swinging in the breeze, and the reason the shadow Treasurer will be swinging with him -  -  - The reason they are swinging in the breeze is that they have a lot of questions to answer about their relationship with the Treasury official and how much pressure they put him under.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Wakefield for the question, which goes to the point of whether anyone has prescience over the weather. Yesterday I referred to attempts that have been made with respect to government policy that would aim to manipulate the weather through cloud seeding. I referred to one of the problems being that the technological papers that were provided were all in Russian and the briefing to Australian officials was also given in Russian. So I went out and had a look and finally managed to find a Reuters article describing what the Russian cloud-seeding technology has been doing. Unfortunately, the article is a year old -  -  - I really think you want to hear it! I quote from Reuters:Russian air force planes dropped a 25-kg _ sack of cement on a suburban Moscow home last week while seeding clouds - An opposition member - So what? - So what? This is the technology we are talking about -  -  -  - I do understand why the Leader of the House made a reference to Mark Latham! The article goes on to say that the police in Naro-Fominsk said:A pack of cement used in creating _ good weather in the capital region _ failed to pulverize completely at high altitude and fell on the roof of a house, making a hole about 80-100 cm _The article continues:A spokesman for the Russian Air Force refused to comment.The homeowner was not injured - fortunately - but refused an offer of 50,000 roubles - </DOC>

 - The inquiry by the Australian Federal Police is made entirely independently of government. I have full and complete confidence in the conduct and the professionalism of the Australian Federal Police. I made a statement last Saturday as to why I requested the secretary of my department to in turn communicate a request to the Australian Federal Police. I did that subsequent to my receiving certain advice from my department as to potential offences under the Criminal Code. On receiving that request from the secretary of my department the Australian Federal Police, through their completely independent decision-making process, made a decision to commence an inquiry. I am aware, as we all are, that the Australian Federal Police issued a statement earlier this week, on Monday. That statement, I might note, was issued after a certain statement was made by the member for North Sydney in this House. The decision by the Australian Federal Police to make that statement was entirely a matter for the Australian Federal Police.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for this question. She is not just a new mum in the parliament but someone who has taken a great interest in our commitments to develop a new plan for maternity services. There are a number of midwives and nurses in her electorate who were very actively involved in our maternity services review. I know she takes a particular interest in it.I have to say that today is a very good day for nurses and midwives across the country. It is a very good day for mothers and a very good day for families because today we introduced into the parliament a piece of legislation of which the government is very proud, providing for the first time MBS, Medicare Benefits Schedule, and PBS, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, access for midwives and nurse practitioners. This means that patients will be able to access their services in a new way. It will be much more convenient for patients to have tests and referrals provided by qualified midwives and nurse practitioners.These reforms will change fundamentally and improve our maternity services across the country. This is a key plank of the $120 million Maternity Services Plan that was part of this year's budget. It is all about improving choices for women and recognising that we need to have access to high-quality, safe maternity care as close to people's homes as possible. I was very pleased to visit the Canberra birthing centre this morning to meet with some of our dedicated midwives, a new mother and an expectant mother to discuss how these reforms would help them now or in the future, if they choose to have more children. The midwives in particular were very excited about the recognition, at last, of their skills.The proposals that are included in our legislation, which I hope will be supported in the House and in the Senate, mean that our midwives and our nurses will be encouraged to use their skills to their fullest capacity. They will be encouraged to work collaboratively with GPs and with obstetricians. But we are fundamentally enhancing the role that they can play in providing services to patients across the country. We want to expand the level of health services and access to health services and, of course, have them as close as we can in our community to where people live.As I said, we are very proud of the changes that are being introduced. It is a key part of our health reform agenda. It is a key part of our primary care agenda, particularly for nurse practitioners. I know, for example, that the member for Brand has been very interested in working with nurse practitioners in Western Australia to ensure that some of the intense workforce shortages that we are still coping with as a legacy from the decisions of the previous government can be tackled by using our workforce more strategically. That means recognising midwives, recognising nurses, encouraging them to work collaboratively with doctors and making sure that better options are available for women and better choices are there. As I say, it is a very good day for nurses, a very good day for midwives, a good day for mums and a good day for Australian families.</DOC>

 - As the honourable member for New England knows, I take each of his questions in this place seriously because he seeks to represent the interests of his constituents. He asked me a question about the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program extension. Can I say to the honourable member that my advice is that the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program has fully committed its funding allocation and is now closed to new applications except in Western Australia, as he is aware.The RRPGP was initiated by the previous government in 2000-01 as an outcome of negotiations with the Australian Democrats following the passage of the GST legislation. To date the program has invested over $215 million supporting renewable remote power generation, with a further $85 million under construction or approved. In the last six months, more than 1,100 applications have been submitted. This compares with around 6,000 applications received in the previous seven years. The available funds have become fully committed and it is therefore necessary to stop accepting applications everywhere except Western Australia. Industry has been aware for some time that this program has finite funds and that the full commitment was imminent. Along with the Solar Homes and Communities Plan, this program has helped prepare the renewable energy industry for transition from the margins to the mainstream of Australia's energy mix.Can I say to the honourable member, on the representations he makes about remote communities, that I would like to have a further discussion with him about what further can be done in this area. That is the specific question he has asked. I know that his questions here are well motivated and well based, and he is actually seeking to reflect the interests of his constituents.He asked more broadly about the question of renewable energy. I say to those opposite and to the House at large, on the question of the renewable energy target, that this is a great question for all Australians out there at present. Namely, with the failure of the parliament to pass the renewable energy target legislation, we are placed in a situation where we do not have a replacement regime. The member for Flinders, who never gets permission to ask a question - The member for Flinders then left the chamber. - I take it, as the member for Flinders is absenting himself, that those opposite are now committed to supporting this legislation. Do they have a position on this legislation? Is it yes or is it no? We do not have any indication whatsoever either on this matter or on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The reason I raised this in response to the honourable member for New England's question is that it goes to the replacement regime for solar panels. It goes to the availability of renewable energy certificates. This is a matter I have raised several times in the parliament in the last week or so. Therefore, I would say to the honourable member and the House more broadly that the replacement regime which provides financial assistance to Australian families, so they can in the future access discounts on solar panels, hangs entirely on the decision by those opposite to pass this legislation through the Senate. Those opposite, in their internal division, stand between Australian households and their ability to access this replacement regime - thousands and thousands of dollars worth of discounts effectively based on the renewable energy certificate regime for those seeking to install solar panels in the future.That is why the second part of the question raised by the honourable member, more broadly on the question of renewable energy, of which solar panels and solar power represent such a large part, is of deep concern to the Australian community as they listen to this debate this afternoon. Those who are seeking to make decisions about solar panels for the future want to know whether the renewable energy certificates regime will be introduced or not. Therefore, it goes right back to the question of the disunity on the part of those opposite and not being able to frame a position. Because of their disunity on this, because the Leader of the Opposition's authority within his party has collapsed, they have postponed any vote on the CPRS. They have refused to indicate, I think, what their position is on the RET, although the National Party have said they are going to vote against it. Therefore, the whole question of disarray within the Liberal Party and the coalition more broadly, and the collapsing leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, is of direct consequence to Australian families seeking to access such basic programs as the future of renewable energy certificates. That is why the question raised by the member for New England is of such direct relevance. Again, I go back to what I have said earlier to members like the honourable member for Bradfield and the member for Higgins in his absence -  - that is, to attend to this matter, as the Leader of the Opposition fails to do, and take the right action himself.The member for North Sydney then left the chamber. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. We have established a strong and direct relationship with local government. Last November we invited every mayor and shire president in the country to Canberra, to Parliament House, to meet with the Prime Minister and the cabinet. As part of that partnership, we determined that we would have an ongoing steering committee of the ACLG. It has continued to meet, discussing microeconomic reform and the challenges confronted by local government - particularly those that have arisen recently as a result of the global economic recession.This year, in response to a request from ACLG, we have convened the second meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government here in Parliament House tomorrow morning. It will be opened by the Prime Minister and attended by cabinet members. The theme of this conference will be building resilience in local communities. Of course, communities have been affected by the global economic crisis, but particular communities have also had particular impacts - most notably the Victorian councils affected by the bushfire tragedy. The parliamentary secretary with responsibility for the Victorian bushfires has convened a special meeting this afternoon of all the councils to discuss responses to emergency situations such as that. My colleague the minister for Indigenous affairs has convened a meeting of councils with strong and large Indigenous communities, making sure as well that they are able to take the opportunity to inform government of their particular special needs.Indeed, out of last year's conference we had a number of very practical measures. We determined to establish a centre of excellence for local government - and an announcement is imminent as a result of a process whereby we asked for applications - so that we can get encouragement of best practice through local government. Tonight we have the Australian local government awards here in Parliament House as well. The centre of excellence for local government will be an important addition to local government in their ability to deal with the challenges, particularly the financial challenges, going forward. It will be about making sure that we learn from best practice and that we spread best practice in order to make sure that at the end of the day ratepayers receive best value for their contributions to local government.We also last year announced the Regional and Local Government Community Infrastructure Program. At the time, we announced it would be $300 million. It now is $800 million. It has two components. The first is a $250 million component, with a proportion going out to all local government areas - that is, not just some but every single council in Australia will benefit from this program - for small projects and making a difference in their local communities. We also had a strategic project section of this announcement, some $550 million, which funded some 137 projects with a total value of some $1.5 billion. Those projects were for over $2 million. There was a competitive assessment process. Out of that we have announced a number of extraordinarily good projects around the nation - projects such as the Einasleigh River Bridge in the electorate of the member for Kennedy - that will make a big difference. I have travelled around the nation, going to the electorates of the member for New England and the member for Lyne, who might like to pass on to the member for Kennedy that I mentioned this critical project. I also visited their electorates, it must be said, and these projects have been extraordinarily well received.The Wauchope Bonny Hills Surf Life Saving Club will now be rebuilt by that community. It is an important hub for community activity. In Tamworth we had a terrific day one Saturday with the member for New England. The member for New England organised for the local basketballers and the local kids to come along. They are going to get a sports centre. That will make a difference. It will bring economic activity to Tamworth. People from the region will be able to gather there. We were looking for projects that would be good for jobs immediately - particularly construction of libraries and sports facilities - but also good for the long term, with a lasting legacy.The message I gave to the Australian Local Government Association on Monday when I opened their conference was that local governments need to ensure that they fulfil the contracts they have been given, which is that work has to commence. We want this to be an important part of the economic stimulus, supporting jobs today and supporting local economies today but also making sure that we are building the local community infrastructure that we need for tomorrow.</DOC>

 - Curiously, this question is raised in this honest spirit of inquiry by the opposition when they have been hawking this around the press gallery for several days. That is point 1. So the honesty with which the honourable member puts this question is itself under some scrutiny and he knows it only to be true. Secondly, I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that on 1 August 2003 you have a statement from me to the pecuniary interests register, which says 'The payment of $28,000 to the Brisbane Airport Corporation by community group Ban Aircraft over Residential Brisbane on 13 June 2003 for a bill received by me by order of the Federal Court for legal costs' and associated details. It is on the pecuniary interests register and has been there for some time.Thirdly, I say to the honourable member in response to his question that he should understand the following, as I am best advised. A community group called Ban Aircraft over Residential Brisbane ran a community fundraiser in 2003 to help pay for the legal costs I incurred in my legal battle with the Brisbane Airport Corporation. Furthermore, as I have just indicated, I declared this assistance on the pecuniary interests register at the time, as is appropriate. I also spoke about it in the House. Furthermore, Mr John Grant, a resident of Brisbane's Southside and who also lives under the flight path, attended that community fundraiser. I say further to the honourable member that tickets for the fundraiser, I understand, were $85. - Furthermore, my understanding is that the tickets to the said dinner, which was attended by, I think, several hundred members of the local community who were affected by the plan of the Brisbane Airport Corporation to put a flight path over Brisbane's Southside, were in the vicinity of $85. Furthermore, there is some suggestion that Mr Grant would have bought an auction item. I do not know whether he did or whether he did not because the fundraiser was run by the community group in question.Therefore, I say to the honourable member to first of all consult the pecuniary interests register. That contribution to me is there from the community group called Ban Aircraft over Residential Brisbane, which I have been associated with for a long time acting as a local member to take a case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and, subsequently, to the Federal Court on behalf of my community in an attempt to stop a challenge by the Brisbane Airport Corporation to put a new parallel runway which would have had a direct impact on my community. Furthermore, when I subsequently lost that court case this community organisation - Ban Aircraft over Residential Brisbane - got together and decided to help raise some funds, about which I not only was transparent in this pecuniary interest declaration but also, as I am advised, made a statement to the parliament around that time about what had been done.Let us go to the absolute core of this continued campaign of political smear. All of this is based on a proposition that I have made a representation on behalf of Mr Grant. That rests in turn on the existence of an email which is now established to be beyond reasonable doubt a forgery, a fake and a false document. Despite that fact, and despite the fact we have been here all week, he stands up here again on the last day of the sitting of this parliament and asks a further question attempting to somehow establish that something improper has occurred here. Let us go to the absolute core of it. The forged document upon which this attack has been based to smear my own reputation and that of the Treasurer has been, shall I say, the subject of some significant engagement on the part of various of those opposite - that is, on how the contents of that email were in fact disseminated - and I notice it is the subject of further commentary in today's newspapers.Yet the core proposition in this politics of smear in which the honourable member has just engaged is that, by virtue of this individual being a participant in a community fundraising event for a declared activity on my part to support my community in a fight against the Brisbane Airport Corporation, is of itself somehow improper, he himself being a local resident. Secondly, it is based on a proposition, I assume that they are still arguing, that there is an improper connection between the individual and me, after having established all week, I thought, that the email which underpins this proposition is itself a forgery.I note further that the Leader of the Opposition, who has run this campaign against me and the Treasurer for some time now, did not have the courage to stand up and ask this question himself. We now have the delegation of a campaign of personal smear against me and others in this place. This local person, Mr Grant, is a member of the local community and runs a business out in Ipswich. I understand the former member for Blair, Mr Cameron Thompson, today said some positive things about him. I am not sure whether that is the case. I do not know exactly what his involvement in the Ipswich business community is. That is not an area in which I am personally resident. I do know, however, that as a local resident in my area he has been concerned about aircraft noise, like others, and therefore chose to come along to that event to support it.I just suggest to those opposite, as they continue to engage in the politics of smear of this individual - as well as the politics of smear in terms of a purported relationship which is improper between that individual and me - which in turn hangs on the existence of this document, that the honourable member should reflect on the fact that the document on which this entire campaign of personal smear has been based in the course of the last week or so is a forgery, a fake, a false document. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that he has many, many questions to answer. He has many questions to answer concerning this matter, some of which have been canvassed in today's newspapers and many of which have not.I say also to the honourable member the following: it is important at a time like this, when the nation is under grave economic challenge, that those opposite seem to regard the nature of the global recession as somehow irrelevant to their concerns and the concerns of working families across Australia. This government is engaged, with every ounce of effort and every ounce of energy it has, in dedicating its time to implementing our nation building for recovery plan. It seems that what the Leader of the Opposition is doing instead is wasting the nation's time in campaigns of continued personal smear and fear. In the case of both those campaigns, they are based on absolute falsehood.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question, because the Northern Territory and Darwin, being export oriented, are directly affected by the impacts of the global recession on growth and on jobs - therefore his community, like those across the entire nation, is deeply concerned by what actions can be taken to reduce the impact of this recession.The current global economic recession is the worst set of economic circumstances Australia has faced in three-quarters of a century. And Australia, despite this challenge, is doing better than most other economies. Last night two key international economic reports were released - firstly, the latest Economic Outlook from the OECD and, secondly, the IMF's Australia 2009 Article IV Consultation Concluding Statement. These reports indicate that the Australian government's early and decisive action concerning the economy helped cushion the Australian economy from the worst impacts of this global recession.Furthermore, what these reports and other data underpin are the following four propositions. We currently, among the major advanced economies, have the fastest growth. We also have the second lowest unemployment. We have the lowest debt. We also have the lowest deficit.That is where we stand - on the basis of this most recently released data - against the major advanced economies. On the fastest growth, the OECD still projects that Australia's economy will contract by 0.4 per cent in 2009. This is the mildest contraction of any of the 30 OECD economies and compares with contractions of 2.8 per cent in the US, 6.8 per cent in Japan and 4.8 per cent in the euro area. This confirms the information from Australia's own national accounts that Australia is the fastest growing economy in the OECD.We also have the second lowest unemployment. The OECD forecasts that unemployment in Australia will rise to 7.9 per cent by the end of 2010. This is substantially lower than the 9.9 per cent predicted for the OECD as a whole. This is the second lowest of any of the major advanced economies. I would say again that any job lost is one lost job too many. This government will continue to inject every effort into supporting employment at a time of grave global economic difficulty.In terms of the state of deficit across the major advanced economies, the OECD forecasts Australia's budget deficit for all levels of government to reach five per cent of GDP in 2010. This is nearly 60 per cent lower than the 8.8 per cent of GDP deficit for the OECD as a whole. Again, it is the lowest of all the major advanced economies. Also, we know from other data that Australia's debt is the lowest of all the major advanced economies. The OECD itself says:The infrastructure development program announced in the 2009-10 budget is welcome and should strengthen fiscal policy impact.The OECD report also notes that we are by no means out of the woods yet. The OECD warns that the ensuing recovery is likely to be both weak and fragile for some time and that the negative economic and social consequences of the crisis will be long lasting. Furthermore, it has stressed the importance of governments implementing stimulus measures promptly and fully. It says:Because of the weakness of the expected recovery, the OECD argues that governments need to implement announced stimulus measures promptly and fully. These tax breaks or spending measures should not be withdrawn at a pace which jeopardizes the recovery. Similarly, better regulation of financial markets to guard against future crises is now urgent.This is the government's strategy. It is nation-building for recovery. It has been shown by the data which has come in from the OECD, the IMF and, most recently, our national accounts that it is having an effect - that is, we have managed so far to avoid a technical recession. We are not out of the woods yet. We also have the fastest growth of the major advanced economies - and the fastest growth of all the advanced economies, as released most recently in other documents.Part of the reason this has been possible is that we the government, in partnership with state and local governments, believe that it is important for us all to act together, because we are all in this together. That is why I particularly welcome the representatives of most of our 565 councils and shires who are here in Canberra today for the second Australian Council of Local Government meeting.The reason I say this is that the councils represented here today have been in the business of nation building for recovery. Through initiatives announced by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government we have had an $800 million investment in community infrastructure projects. And I am advised that some 3,300 of these projects are rolling out across the country. More than 100 community projects have already been completed, thanks to the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. I am advised that this includes such projects as the new spectator facilities and change rooms at the Renmark oval in South Australia, which received investment of $374,000; the new kitchen that has been installed at the Conargo Memorial Hall, in regional New South Wales, with $40,000 from the government; and the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, in Western Australia, using part of its funding to upgrade the war memorial. These are just a few of the projects from the many thousands of projects in which 500 or so local governments are now participating with the Australian government in supporting across the nation.I formally today as Prime Minister of the country publicly salute the critical role of local government in being partners in Australia's nation building for recovery plan. Local government, together with other levels of government, are doing their bit to pitch in to make a difference. That is what is important here. They believe that governments should be in the business of performing a positive role, they should be in the business of performing a constructive role, they should be in the business of building the nation up, not talking it down. Whatever our politics may be, in each of the elected councils attending this conference here in Canberra today the unifying mission is this: what difference can we make to build this economy up when the global economic recession is seeking to tear it down? We are all in this together, and I salute the role of Australian local governments here in this building today.</DOC>

 - I have no idea what period of time the gentleman is referring to. I will check my records. I have no such recollection. I say to the honourable member that, when it comes to the continued politics of smear in this place, those opposite -  -  - I just say to those opposite: at a time when the nation, its families and its governments are wanting all people in this place to focus positively on how we lift the economy up, how we build up local communities and how we support local jobs, this government, in partnership with others, is in the business of implementing nation building for recovery. I say to those opposite who continue to engage in activities of this nature: we are using our time, our efforts and our energy as a government to support the economy, jobs and small business. What they are doing is wasting the nation's time and engaging in the activities of fear and smear, with one single objective: to talk the economy down, to try and bring a government down. On top of that, both these campaigns are based on an absolute falsehood in relation to the false, fake and forged email on which basis the Leader of the Opposition has so many, many questions to answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. Last night two very important and very significant reports were released on global economic conditions and the relationship between those global economic conditions and the Australian economy. Of course, both these reports provide further evidence that the government's efforts to stimulate the economy are working to position Australia as one of the strongest performing economies in the advanced world, and that is something that we on this side of the House celebrate. We certainly know that we have some very big challenges ahead, but what we also know is that if we all pull together, if we work together with the local governments of this country, with the state governments, with local communities, with the business community, we can do our best to cushion the Australian economy from the very savage impacts of this global recession.Last night the IMF had a few things to say. I think those opposite might be a little embarrassed when they hear what the IMF had to say, because the IMF commended the government on its three-stage stimulus strategy. You will recall that those opposite have been in this House, day in and day out, running down the stimulus strategy. This is what the IMF had to say in their report released overnight:We welcome the quick implementation of targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus.We certainly do, Mr Speaker! They go on:The stimulus provides a sizable boost to domestic demand in 2009 and 2010 that will cushion the impact of the global recession.But, get this statement:The transfers to households had an immediate impact on activity that helped underpin confidence.This is a complete repudiation of the position taken by the opposition in this House as well as in the Senate. The IMF went on to say that they recognised the important role our bank guarantee has played in bolstering confidence and in securing the flow of credit. Who opposed that? The opposition did. They opposed the bank guarantee all the way and they opposed economic stimulus all the way. The IMF went on to say more. They said:Timely and appropriate policy intervention also helped the Australian financial sector. Wholesale funding guarantees allowed for continued access to international capital markets.The IMF made the very obvious point that the impact of our stimulus is the reason that Australia's downturn has been milder than those of most other advanced economies. They also highlighted the importance of infrastructure investment. These reports demonstrate why the government's strategy of investing in infrastructure that leaves a lasting legacy is so important to employment. They are positive assessments. We have a long way to go, but these reports and the outcomes that have come to this country stand in stark contrast to the negative approach of those opposite, who have opposed us every step of the way.</DOC>

 - It is pretty clear they are going to get right down in the gutter today - again. Yesterday they ran out of questions in the House. It was so embarrassing. They tried to shut themselves up four times. It was so embarrassing - they ran out of questions.I made it very clear that I have spoken to Mr Grant. I spoke to him for about two minutes. It is very clear from all of the evidence that other car dealers received treatment the same as, if not better than, him. That is the story. But every time the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer gets up in this House and asks those sorts of gutter questions with the intent of smearing the Prime Minister and me, it absolutely shows that the opposition has no credible leadership, no plan for the economy and no plan for jobs in our community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question and note that he was with the mayors from his local community last night. He had a better evening later on than I did, so we will get that out of the way early - as a Queenslander, he had a better end of the evening than I did.Everyone last night at the Australian Council of Local Government dinner and today at the forum had a very productive second plenary meeting. This is the next step in the new partnership that we are forging between the national government and local government. Local communities rely increasingly upon local government to deliver the services that they need. Every one of the ministers along the front bench participated in the ACLG forums that we held and the subgroups that were held today and yesterday. We heard that increasingly local government is providing much more than rates and rubbish. They are increasingly providing a great number of services critical to the quality of life in local communities.They are rolling out the $800 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, which is so important in supporting jobs in local communities and stimulating local economies. It will provide a long-term legacy for these communities. The Prime Minister announced a measure today, included in our budget, of an additional $220 million for local government through this program. This brings our investment since last November to over $1 billion.We know that at a time when the government is committed to cushioning the impact of the global economic recession, local capital works that can be got going quickly - which are shovel ready - are ideal as a measure to support jobs in communities. Indeed, every single local government area - regardless of political leadership, city or country or state, big or small - has benefited from this important program. Some 3,300 projects have been funded already, with many of those projects already completed. Work is progressing. I am advised that some 88 per cent of projects around the country have work underway right now.I conclude by paying particular tribute to the two national awards for excellence that were presented by the Prime Minister at the Australian local government awards dinner last night. The large council award went to Newcastle City Council for their ClimateCam International Test Laboratory, a world-leading program which has now been copied around the world. The great city of Newcastle is represented by my colleague the member for Newcastle. It takes that regional city to the globe and shows once again that it is, as it is in so many areas, an innovative world leader as a regional city.I want to pay particular tribute to the Carpentaria Shire Council, which is in the electorate of Kennedy. They received the small council award. Their program was entitled 'Domestic violence - it's not our game'. What has occurred there is that the local NRL football team has received sponsorship and support through the local council - this was certainly supported, I am sure, by the member for Kennedy - under the theme 'Domestic violence - it's not our game'. It was found that this community had the worst rates of domestic violence in Queensland and that a very effective way of getting that message out to the community is with this sponsorship. The key outcomes include a 55 per cent drop in domestic violence incidents, a 64 per cent drop in breaches of domestic violence orders and a cultural shift whereby domestic violence is unacceptable. That is a critical example.The young Indigenous men who play for this NRL team were so proud to receive this award from the Prime Minister. These proud Indigenous men will be on The Footy Show tonight. That is a great thing - getting that message about domestic violence out there to communities. Local government has played a critical role in this and so many other community activities. I pay tribute to them. I thank the local government mayors and shire presidents for the way that they participated in what was a very successful second meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government.</DOC>

 - At a time like this, Australians expect us to be working our butts off to support jobs and to support families and not be wasting our time with juvenile misrepresentations of propositions like they have been doing all week. All week they have been doing that. The shadow Treasurer is a world champion at it, but he is very sloppy, our Joe, because he misrepresents what is said all of the time. I think it is the case that Australians are fed up with the behaviour of the opposition in this House and up in the Senate. They are fed up with it. I can see today from the doorstops that so are some of the backbench over there. This is what the member for Bowman had to say on the doors today. He said: 'It's been a bit disappointing that the entire week has been consumed by an affair that isn't making a great deal of difference around the kitchen table.' I will tell you who is focused on the kitchen table: everybody on this side of the House. That is what we were doing back in February: supporting car dealers right around the country, trying to address the situation that had been brought about by the global recession. We were concerned about problems in the auto supply chain. That is what we were concerned about and genuine about. - There is more than one, because we also had the member for Canning on the doors:They - constituents - are more interested in what's happening to them on a daily basis - what's happening to, you know, their jobs, what's happening to their mortgages. They're more interested in that than this, what I consider somewhat of a sideshow.'What have his leader and the shadow Treasurer been doing all week? It is a sideshow! We are in the middle of a global recession. This economy is performing the best -  - This economy is performing the best of any advanced economy in the OECD, but there are big challenges ahead. The biggest roadblock to recovery in this country is the focus of the opposition on fear campaigns on debt and smear campaigns against me and the Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question. While much public commentary has been focused on the global recession and the financial crisis that triggered it and the Liberal Party remains obsessed with ludicrous conspiracy theories that are swirling around their feet and minds, the government is focused firmly on the longer term, particularly the longer term economic challenges facing Australia. At the heart of those challenges lies one word, a simple concept, and that is productivity. That is at the centre of the economic challenge facing Australia in the longer term.If you look at the mechanisms through which the global financial crisis has been transmitted into Australia and how it has impacted on the Australian economy and how the global recession is impacting on the Australian economy, at the core of that lies poor export performance, a very large current account deficit - it was over six per cent of GDP when we took office - and long-term dependence on foreign borrowing by our banking system. All of those are factors which ultimately are symptoms of inadequate productivity performance. We have to improve our productivity performance in Australia.If you look at the long-term trend, in the mid-nineties productivity was tracking over a five-year average at about 3.3 per cent. That has deteriorated to a point where in mid-2000 that average had gone down to 1.1 per cent. That is simply not good enough. It is not good enough for a modern nation like Australia that aspires to high living standards and to security for its people.The government does have a comprehensive strategy for a long-term approach to dealing with the productivity problems facing Australia. That strategy consists of, first, investing in long-term infrastructure, in economic infrastructure through the Building Australia Fund, and of course Infrastructure Australia. Examples that were announced in the budget include the Oakajee Port project in Western Australia, the Hunter Expressway in New South Wales, the regional rail project in Victoria and of course the big equity injection for the Australian Rail Track Corporation.Second, there is the National Broadband Network, which is transforming our economy and our productive capacity. Once it is implemented, it will completely alter the business environment with opportunities for innovation, the creation of new applications and new business models in the Australian economy. Third, there is investment in the development of skills all the way from early childhood through to university and beyond, investment both in capital and buildings, whether for schools or universities, through the education infrastructure fund, or indeed in more university places.Fourth, we have investment in renewable energy with investment in the transition that our economy has to make from a high-carbon economy to a low-carbon economy through things like the Renewables Institute and Solar Institute. Fifth, we are reforming the structure of assistance for research and development in the Australian economy, particularly the transformation of the old R&amp;D tax concession into a R&amp;D tax credit which will make for much greater opportunities for smaller, newer companies to access the effective assistance that that credit will provide. And sixth - and certainly by no means least - there will be regulatory reform, developing a seamless national economy for Australia so that antiquated state boundaries and state and territory regulatory regimes can be harmonised across the country and we have a single national economic framework within which business can function.The Liberal Party display little interest in these issues. When they do display some interest, their sole involvement is to snipe, to attack, to undermine. Sadly, that lack of interest has been a characteristic of their behaviour and not just recently in their opposition mode of opportunistically talking down the economy; it has also been characteristic of their role in government. Australia has endured a lost decade in productivity, a lost decade in export performance, a lost decade in investment in infrastructure, a lost decade in investment in skills and a lost decade in regulatory reform - all at the hands of the previous government. There is no interest in the hard yards that need to be done to lift Australia's productivity performance. They inherited a strong productivity economy from the previous Labor government and they handed over to this Labor government a low-productivity economy. It turns to the Labor Party, the Rudd government, yet again to lift the productivity performance of Australia back to where it needs to be.All week we have had this trivial, juvenile nonsense that has been dreamed up in their own conspiratorial minds - and we are hearing it again today - about issues that the vast majority of Australians do not care about. The government are getting on with the tough business of governing Australia, of lifting our productivity performance, of investing for the long-term, future prosperity of this nation. The opposition is not fit to lead Australia and, most importantly, the Leader of the Opposition is not fit to lead this nation.</DOC>

 - I stand by everything that I have said earlier in this place and I have full confidence in the Treasurer. That is the first point. The second thing I would say to those opposite is that the Leader of the Opposition, as this week has unfolded, has fundamentally holed his integrity. He has fundamentally undermined his authority. We have seen it day in, day out through this debate in this chamber. When the nation is expecting us to be engaged in a debate about the economy, about climate change and about jobs, instead, after 36 hours of the House sitting this week, those opposite have not asked a single question on the economy, not a single question on families, not a single question on education, not a single question on health, not a single question, least of all, on climate change. There has not been a single question on any matter other than what we have seen, which is the rolling politics of fear and smear.Can I simply say to those opposite that throughout the course of this week what we have had is a government getting on with the business of cushioning Australia from the worst impacts of the global economic recession in contrast with a Liberal Party wasting the nation's time rather than getting on with the business of government. What we in the government have is a positive economic strategy to cushion Australia from the recession. Those opposite have a negative strategy with the objective of talking the economy down based on the politics of fear and smear and based, in the end, on the falsehood of a forged document. Above all, what we have demonstrated this week is that this Leader of the Opposition is no longer sustainable in his current position.We saw the member for North Sydney walk away from him only the other night. We saw the member for North Sydney, in response to the question 'Whose idea was this?' say, 'Ah, his.' He said it did not have anything to do with him. As I said yesterday to the House, when you are in a scrap the last person you want to have behind you is the member for North Sydney. The member for North Sydney demonstrated such robust qualities of loyalty and solidarity to his leader when placed under pressure in an interview only yesterday! Instead, he ran a million miles away. But he is not the only one. Various writers in today's papers have reflected the observations of others. In other words, when asked the common question on the part of all those opposite: 'Whose strategy was this?' the general answer on the part of those opposite was: 'It was this fellow's strategy.' In fact, it was: 'Don't look at me, just look at him.'Where we have got to in this debate, which has lasted the entire week when the entire nation would have had us focus instead on jobs, on small business, on getting ahead with the economy and on making sure that we make a difference in the midst of the worst economic recession in three-quarters of a century, is a Leader of the Opposition slowly sinking beneath the waves in the eyes of his colleagues. What we have now, through his own efforts this week and his own efforts alone, is a Leader of the Opposition no longer fit for office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, because I think all fair-minded Australians and all fair-minded peoples in the world are observing events in Iran at present with great concern at this rolling travesty of democracy. The Australian government deplores the brutality, the repression and the violence against peaceful protesters. There are clear doubts about the integrity of the election process and result - doubts made even clearer by the announcement of a review of the results by the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei.Preliminary findings are that there were electoral irregularities. Two days ago, Khamenei agreed to extend the review - but for a mere five days. We call on this review to be full, fair and thorough with the results made available for all to see. Frankly, we do not hold much hope. The Iranian authorities have pre-empted the review by rolling out an annulment of the election results. This is genuinely a disgrace. Worse, they have undertaken a severe crackdown on their own people. Voters and ordinary citizens are so concerned by the election results they risk their lives to speak up for their vote. They are peaceful protestors facing violent reprisals and growing arrests. People are shouting their protest from the rooftops in the dark because they are so afraid of what would happen to them were they to say so during the daylight. There is an increased media blackout making it harder for the world to see the true extent of what is going on in Iran today. But we see enough to discern the truth. We have condemned the reported arrest of journalists and remain deeply concerned about foreign journalists being told to leave Iran.This behaviour is in stark contrast to the political enthusiasm shown by the people of Iran in the lead-up to the elections. Expressing our concern and outrage at the brutalisation of peaceful protesters is not, as Iran's leadership has claimed, interference in its internal affairs; it is an obligation. The Australian government calls on Iran to halt violence against protesters, to ensure that all Iranians have the right to peaceful protest and the free expression of their political views, to release those who have been detained for expressing their political views, to allow media freedom as part of that free expression and to review the electoral process thoroughly, dispassionately and fairly so that the will of the Iranian people can be seen to be expressed.The Australian government has registered its deep concerns with the government of Iran and will continue to do so in partnership with our friends and allies around the world. The government will also continue to urge Iran, and will continue to press action on Iran, to meet its international obligations related to concerns about its nuclear program. Iran continues to reject sustained international efforts to work with it to resolve this problem. It continues to reject the generous package offered for a resolution of this problem. As we know, President Obama has made a historic decision to reach out his hand to Iran. We support his diplomacy and his action unreservedly. Iran now has an opportunity to offer its own hand back. As I have said before, Iran therefore has a clear choice: it can take a responsible path and take concrete steps to engage with the international community or it can continue down its current path, which will only lead to further international isolation. I believe I speak on behalf of all members in this place when we condemn the repression of human rights in Iran and this appalling travesty of democracy unfolding before our eyes.</DOC>

 - First of all, that car dealer never contacted my office. That car dealer did contact the member for Flynn, who did assist that car dealer. As I said to the member the other day, if he has any further information, I am more than happy to follow it up with the Treasury. I have no evidence that that car dealer did speak to Treasury but, if that exists, I will be happy to follow it up. These matters are being dealt with by the Treasury secretary. You would appreciate that in these circumstances it is somewhat more difficult at the moment, given the circumstances of one of the officers in the department.It is also the case that many car dealers may not have been eligible for assistance. It depends on the circumstances. If the member is serious, I am happy to look at all of those details, and I will follow them up, as I have done whenever I have been approached by anybody.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Corangamite. I know he is very concerned about employment in the construction industry in his area in particular. In October the government established the first home owner boost because we knew that increased activity in the housing and construction area would support jobs, not just in the construction industry itself but also in the material supply, retail, banking and other associated industries. I am very pleased to inform the House that, by the end of May this year, 97,761 households had taken up the first home owner boost. That means that by now well over 100,000 households have benefited from the first home owner boost. That is nation building for our future.The member for Corangamite has been telling me about how successful this boost has been in the area he represents - in suburbs like Grovedale, Torquay and Colac. It is a story I have been hearing around the country. For months the official data has been telling us that record numbers of first home buyers are entering the market. Housing finance data shows that, and ABS data on employment by industry shows that employment in the construction industry was up by 10,000 jobs in the three months to May 2009.Two months ago I visited a first home buyers show in Brisbane. There I saw the number of people getting information about entering the housing market. I also met Rob Lyndon, the Managing Director of Adenbrook Homes. He said to me that, whereas once upon a time first home buyers accounted for about 10 per cent of Adenbrook's business, they now account for about 40 per cent of Adenbrook's business. That means that they are bringing a different type of product to the market - smaller and more modest homes. Theirs start at $125,900, plus land costs. They are also expanding into three additional regions because of the extra demand generated by this government's first home owner boost.Of course, our support for housing and construction reaches beyond first home buyers to the $6.4 billion we have set aside to build 20,000 new public housing dwellings across the country. The great news is that we are well ahead of schedule with this building. With the $400 million we have set aside for repairs and maintenance, we had originally planned for about 2,500 homes to be saved from the wrecker's ball. Instead, 10,648 dwellings will be saved from the wrecker's ball and another 38,000 homes will have other work done to them. In stage 1 of new construction, which is under way, we are building 2,690 dwellings, which is 400 more than we anticipated, and 500 of these homes are being built as we speak. The first one is complete and a family has already moved in - well ahead of the time we expected.This government has a plan for nation building for recovery. It would be terrific if the opposition focused, as we have been focusing, on jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - I am interested that the honourable member raises the question of inquiries. I am interested that the honourable member raises the question which therefore goes to what is happening with an AFP inquiry. It goes to the question of an undertaking that he gave across the chamber two days ago to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation that he would cooperate fully with the AFP investigation, yet I heard in the last 24 hours - I thought - the Leader of the Opposition saying he would not provide his computer records to this inquiry. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to reflect on that.The government has in place an AFP inquiry. We have in place an Auditor-General's inquiry. We believe these measures are sufficient. I say to the honourable member opposite that there are so many questions which now hang over his head concerning his dealings with this individual. It is time that he gave a full account of these matters. - Yes.</DOC>

 - Can I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. Unlike our friends opposite, who on this subject are led by a cabal of sceptics and fakers, the member for Leichhardt along with his colleagues on this side of the House understand only too well the impact of climate change on their communities.It is worth while reflecting for just a moment on the likely health effects of climate change. They are likely to include deaths, illness and injury from heatwaves affecting, in particular, children, the elderly, people from lower socioeconomic groups, people with pre-existing medical conditions, people employed outdoors, such as construction workers; and from more frequent and intense extreme weather events, including bushfires, floods, storms, coastal storm surges and cyclones. And these may of course also trigger mental health problems. I make the observation, despite the protests from those opposite, that during the course of the debate earlier this week on the issue of rural adjustment members of the National Party sitting in this place spoke about the importance of looking after the mental health of their constituents. They said this because of the duress they were under as a result of climatic events.Unlike those opposite, we understand that we need to do something about climate change. I know that the member for Leichhardt, for example, is acutely aware of the impacts of climate change on his electorate. In his electorate he can expect the spread of vector-borne, water-borne and food-borne disease. He can expect dengue fever to spread, possibly getting down as far as Rockhampton by 2050. He can expect increasingly extreme storm events. He can expect that the Great Barrier Reef is likely to experience significant annual bleaching by 2030.The member for Mallee - someone who, I understand, thinks carefully about these issues - can expect that in his electorate the average annual number of days over 35 degrees will increase significantly. In Victoria the decline in annual rainfall and increased evaporation is likely to reduce run-off into rivers by up to 45 per cent in 29 catchments by 2030. The member for Kalgoorlie can expect that by 2030 the annual average number of days in Broome over 35 degrees will grow from the current 54 days to between 64 and 119 days. - It just demonstrates the truth of what I said at the outset: they are led by a cabal of sceptics and fakers. We are about to start the show season in the Northern Territory. You can understand what we are about to see. We could have this cabal of fakers standing around the parade ring being led by the Leader of the Opposition followed by his conga line - these people who are sceptics who are not prepared to act on the issue of climate change and are stalling the government's CPRS legislation in the Senate. This is a demonstration yet again not only of their lack of understanding of their own communities or their understanding of the regional impacts of climate change or their care for their communities but of how unfit they are to govern.</DOC>

 - I am genuinely puzzled by the member for Curtin's question, because I have here a media statement by the Australian Federal Police which tends to suggest that she has not been keeping up with events. So I would suggest that it is long overdue for the opposition to get onto the real issues that concern people in this nation; to give up on what has become a desperately embarrassing effort that now has absolutely not the slightest thread of credibility. So, I am afraid that there is no basis for the -  - In conclusion, I would point out to the member for Curtin that, if she scrutinises Hansard for Monday, 22 June - in particular, statements from the member for North Sydney - she might find that in fact her question could be better addressed to him.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for the question. A good part of the positive economic story that has been coming out in various reports of late has been the success of Australian agricultural exports. The government has been determined through the process following the Beale review to continue to advance that. Members would be aware that, previously, questions have been asked by the opposition on the cost impact that would come about as a result of the abolition of the 40 per cent export subsidy. Following that first being announced, representations were made to me by industry to seek out ways that we could perhaps kick off a reform process which would allow a whole lot of efficiencies to be driven so that, instead of a cost-recovery process which demanded that the public servants would have to make themselves more efficient directly and then industry would just have to wear whatever cost the outcome was, industry would have the potential to take control of some of those efficiencies on a more direct basis.Those discussions have been continuing with industry, and last Friday I was able to jointly announce with industry a $40 million package, all of which was extra money being made available to deliver those reforms over the next 12 months.In the days that have followed, there have been very constructive conversations with all sides of parliament and all sides of the Senate, which came to a head today in a discussion as to whether or not the Senate would pursue issues that had already been flagged with respect to disallowance of the fees that have come through as a result of the abolition of the 40 per cent export subsidy. All members of the Senate have been involved in constructive conversations. I want to particularly acknowledge the work of and the discussions that we had with the Greens on particular undertakings that they sought with respect to the horticulture sector and making sure that the refund process could actually be done across the entire 12 months, taking account of the seasonal nature of those exports. I also acknowledge the discussions with both the shadow minister for agriculture, fisheries and forestry here and his representative in the Senate in terms of particular guarantees that they have sought on both a 12-month review and a review that would take account of the impact on small abattoirs in the lead-up between now and August.I am pleased to say that the Senate ended up determining to defer that disallowance resolution. What that allows now is for the reform process to go ahead. Had that disallowance been carried, there would have been a $40 million hole in the quarantine budget, and the quarantine services would not have been in a position to continue to fund themselves throughout the whole financial year.It has been a situation where a lot of constructive work has been done during the course of the week, and Australian agricultural exporters have an opportunity now to be the long-term beneficiaries of a long-overdue reform.</DOC>

 - I go to his 'Kennedyesque' preamble to his question. I noted them all down. They go to renewable energy, the future of coal fired generation and other forms of generation, a national transmission system, peak load stations and also a national electricity market - and the role within all that of a feed-in tariff regime, as I understand it.In terms of our commitment, first of all, to action on climate change, the government's strategy is clear. We are proceeding on at least three separate fronts. Firstly, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, as honourable members would be aware, has been introduced by the government to the parliament. We await with active interest what those opposite will do in terms of a critical vote which must occur on it. We know that those opposite have voted so far to do one thing, which is to vote not to vote on it.But we, the government, have decided that the way ahead is for Australia to have a legislative regime in place because of the needs of business certainty and because of the impending meeting in Copenhagen, which affects us all. The decisions taken there will affect what happens with greenhouse gas emissions globally and, critically, the roll-in of the big economies.The second front that we are operating on, of course, is what we are doing on energy efficiency. We have particular measures on that already advanced, not least of which is the $4 billion investment that we have underway at present for energy efficiency measures for homes - namely, to have as an objective for the nation energy efficiency measures including ceiling insulation in all of Australia's owner occupied dwellings. That is a good objective for the nation - and good for jobs also, on the way through - but very good in terms of taking 50 million tonnes equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions out of the atmosphere.The third front that we are operating on is the renewable energy target, and of course that goes to the question of legislation as well. We wait with interest as to the posture that will be adopted by those opposite. This is also important, as honourable members would be aware, to the matters I raised earlier in the week about creating the legislative regime to provide discounts effectively for consumers wanting to install solar panels in the future. It is critical that this legislation is passed because it goes to how in fact we are going to provide renewable energy certificates -  - I do love it when the Liberal Party interject on the delay of legislation. The member for Flinders - in on queue. When it comes to the delay in legislation, when those opposite boast of filibustering, there is something to be answered by those opposite: who is in the business of delaying legislation? We know why these things are occurring. It goes to a collapse of authority, a collapse of leadership. The Leader of the Opposition cannot unite his party, cannot unite the Liberal Party -  - or the coalition on these critical questions which are before the parliament.On the renewable energy target, it also goes to a question which was raised by the honourable member about how we dovetail those arrangements and other arrangements with the whole proposition of feed-in tariffs. This will be the subject of continuing discussion between ourselves and the states. As the honourable member will be familiar with, states have different arrangements on this matter. I can understand, therefore, some of the concerns that are raised in the community on this. We, through our officials, are consulting with the states on a range of matters and will continue to do so. As these consultations come to a conclusion and produce a particular outcome for the nation on feed-in tariffs, if we are able to get to that outcome, then I will of course answer further to the honourable member's question. We understand the logic of what has been put behind it, we understand the difficulties we currently face given the different regimes which exist in various other states and we understand the complexities which arise as a result, but I can assure the honourable member that we are working through each of those challenges and we are doing so with officials from all of the states and territories.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question and for her very hard work on behalf of more than 26,500 pensioners in her electorate of Shortland.I can inform the House and the 3.3 million pensioners around Australia - age pensioners, disability support pensioners, carers and veterans service pensioners - that we expect and hope that this afternoon in the Senate this government's historic reforms to the pension will become law. These laws will deliver a historic level of pension increase and historic reforms to the pension from September this year. These reforms are long overdue. A new report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reveals that the government's reforms are certainly essential. The Pensions at a glance report shows that the poverty rate for older Australians is double the OECD average. The report bases its figures on 2006 figures. Only Ireland, Korea and Mexico have higher rates of old-aged poverty than Australia. The OECD makes it clear that Australia's pension system has been inadequate for some time. It says:The high risk of old-age poverty in Australia is mainly due to the relatively low level of the age pension.Page after page in this report shows how the former government ignored the plight of pensioners for 12 long years. For 12 years they did nothing, despite knowing just how tough it has been for pensioners in this country. The previous cabinet even rejected a proposal brought by the previous minister to their cabinet to increase the pension. I say to the current Leader of the Opposition: shame on him and shame on every single member of the former Howard government that ignored the plight of our pensioners.By contrast, of course, this government is delivering the biggest pension reform for 100 years. For 100 years we have seen the pension as such a critical part of our social security system, and these reforms are long overdue. We know that these reforms have also needed some very tough, very difficult decisions made that the previous government did not have the bottle to make. They did not have the decency to increase the pension and they certainly did not have the bottle to do some of the difficult things that needed to be done - decisions like increasing the age pension age. Of course now that they are in opposition, they say that they support some of these tough decisions. Here is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say in relation to the age pension age on ABC radio back in May:_ I think a modest increase in the age is a structural reform that is worthwhile.But of course we have got very used to the Leader of the Opposition saying one thing and his members of the coalition rushing out there and saying the exact opposite. We know he cannot control his party on climate change or on alcopops legislation and he certainly cannot control his party on pension reform. What I have here is something from yet another member of the Liberal opposition. This is from the South Australian senator Simon Birmingham. He is out there in his latest newsletter saying:The Labor government has once again shown its mean and tricky colours by raising the retirement age.That is the exact opposite -  - That is exactly right; the Prime Minister reminds me. The member for Warringah says we should increase the age pension age more quickly, the Leader of the Opposition says we should do it and Simon Birmingham said it is somehow 'mean and tricky'. Of course, we know who was the best at mean and tricky statements. What we would hope to see from a real leader is the capacity to get behind these tough decisions, to pull his party together and to make sure that we get these tough decisions through the parliament. But what we know, in fact, is that he has completely lost control and the opposition is now a total rabble.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for the question. It is a further statement of her interest not only in the energy debate but in the all-important issue of clean energy. On 17 May the Prime Minister announced that Australia would join the International Renewable Energy Agency. It is on that basis that I will be travelling to Egypt on the weekend for the purposes of signing on behalf of Australia at the formation of the international institute and participating in a debate about the work of the International Renewable Energy Agency.Historically, Australia's participation internationally in the energy debate has gone to the work of the International Energy Agency, and for years that debate has been on the question of energy security. Given the challenge of climate change and the need to move to a low-emissions global community, the debate about energy has become far more complex. It is no longer just about energy security; it is also about energy security in the context of moving towards clean energy. Our participation in IRENA is very much part of that. It is about Australia leading internationally, in the same way in which we are leading domestically, on the clean energy debate.I have already referred to the fact that it was Australia's leadership that has now led to the formation of the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, which is about making sure that we maintain energy security in Australia whilst guaranteeing the future of our coal fired power stations because, as we all appreciate, they supply 82 per cent of Australia's energy. In terms of the international energy debate, it is also our responsibility not only to invest in technology domestically but also to participate in the international technology debate. I say that because technology has created this challenge of climate change, and technology will be the solution. The role of IRENA is to promote the sustainable use of renewable energy on a global scale. It is also its responsibility, as it is Australia's responsibility, to devolve that technology to developing nations. If we are to make a contribution globally, then one of our responsibilities is to invest internationally in research and development and to assist less developed countries to pick up and use that technology on a commercial scale.The question also went to our responsibilities domestically on the climate change front. I remind the House that the budget actually provided for an investment of $2 billion by the Australian government in accelerating the demonstration on a commercial base of renewable energy in Australia. That commitment included $1.6 billion for the Solar Flagships Program and an additional $465 million to the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. That raises the issue of certainty. It goes to the heart of our requirement as a nation to put a price in place on carbon and also to establish once and for all a set target on renewable energy. I say that because the energy security debate requires investment horizons that enable the private sector to make investment decisions in Australia. As we all appreciate -  - It has been a year of hard work. The member for Flinders needs to be reminded of a comparison with the work we put in place over the last four months. We put in place the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and we also put in place the renewable energy target that will facilitate investment in Australia, but he was part of a government that had 12 years to do something and actually did nothing on the climate change debate.That also raises the nature of question time today. This government has actually focused on a serious debate throughout the course of question time this afternoon, and I compare that with the other side of the House. Just think about the issues that we have confronted this afternoon, and not only this afternoon but over the course of the whole week, while the opposition has continued to wallow in the gutter. Let us go to the nature of those questions: the all-important issue of jobs and the state of the Australian economy - an issue that never confronted the previous government over 12 long years. - Mr Speaker, I was going to the issue of climate change and the importance of the economy. Our investment in climate change actually goes to the issue of the future of the Australian economy, because unless we invest in clean energy we do not have energy security in Australia. And energy security goes to the heart of the debate in the House this afternoon in question time: the strength of the Australian economy, our capacity to invest in infrastructure and our capacity to create new jobs in Australia and to skill Australia in new challenges with respect to job growth and investment by the private sector in Australia. It also goes to the issue of productivity - just like climate change, another issue that the former government never confronted over 12 years. So, as we leave question time this afternoon, at the end of a long parliamentary session, just think about this comparison. - Yes, the truth does hurt. This side of the House will continue to solve the problems the Australian community expects us to solve to invest in our future, while the opposition continues to wallow in the gutter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his comments concerning the ministerial statement on forestry that was made yesterday. One of the important things for people in any form of business, including the farming business, is to have certainty. It is important to provide certainty for them so that they are able to make business decisions now, plan for themselves and then act into the future. That is the reason the government made sure that it put out for discussion the green paper on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, made sure it put out the white paper and made sure it put out the draft legislation and introduced the legislation into the parliament using a very clear timetable.That capacity for certainty is entirely limited by the incapacity of the opposition to deliver on providing a position. Whether it be on the alcopops legislation, on the immigration vote that we had today or on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the only thing they have been unable to agree on is to not vote at all. The sceptics have gradually won the argument and the person who badged himself as believing passionately in action on this issue was even willing to abandon that. Of all the things that business will ask for on any policy issue, the one they ask for most often is certainty, yet we find ourselves in a situation where even that is not able to be delivered because of the state of the current opposition. The fact is that they are in the situation now of having more factions and groups than they have members.I also deal with the importance of certainty in animal welfare in my role in the agriculture portfolio. The differences from state to state and the different sets of rules regarding animal welfare are seen as being a major problem, which is often raised in the ministerial council. My responsibilities do not go only to production animals; they also extend to domestic pets. The Leader of the House used the line a couple of days ago, in passing, that a dead cat can not bounce. Annabel Crabb has revealed a story of the very sad passing of a cat, in the Quarterly Essay, which raises serious -  - As part of that protection of fauna, it is important that we know that when someone is in a bad mood you do have to take extra care of domestic pets.</DOC>

 - On the impact of electricity prices flowing from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, I would draw the opposition's attention to the government's white paper of the end of last year and also to the provisions contained within it for compensation for lower income households when it comes to the impact of higher electricity prices for households. It follows quite plainly that, if you adjust the carbon price in a country, it flows through to the general economy. That is why the government's response to this through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme deals with the need to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. That is the first principle. The second principle is to provide adjustment arrangements for industry, who are most likely to be directly affected by this change in the carbon price. The third principle is a set of arrangements detailed in the government's arrangements for providing assistance to households - in particular, pensioners, carers, seniors and other low-income households - as well as support for middle-income households and for motorists.The question that the honourable member poses is: how do we deal with the impact on electricity prices for Australian households? The honourable member has also referred to a publication, which was apparently released yesterday, which goes to what might or might not currently constitute the opposition's policy on climate change. When asked yesterday whether in fact the release of this document represented coalition policy, the Leader of the Opposition said no, it did not. Therefore we are left in the position - in this critical week when the Senate is due to vote on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, Australia's response to the challenge of climate change - where the opposition, as of Tuesday of this week, two days before the vote is due in the Senate, has produced a document which it then, on the next breath, says is not coalition policy.For 12 years those opposite stood in this place and did nothing when it came to emissions trading. -  - There are interjections from those opposite that that is an incorrect claim on my part. Perhaps someone could direct me as to where the emissions trading scheme is. Perhaps we have lost it somewhere. Perhaps it is simply in someone's top drawer. Perhaps it is out there and no-one has yet discovered it. For 12 years there was no action from those opposite on climate change through the introduction of an emissions trading scheme.The second point is that prior to the last election the opposition put their hand on their heart and said they would introduce an emissions trading scheme. That was their promise, and they said it would be a cap-and-trade scheme. Suddenly, we have produced yesterday something which is not a cap-and-trade scheme. That I find remarkable of itself. There has not only been a 12-year inaction record as far as the introduction of an ETS. Secondly, they promised to introduce a cap-and-trade scheme, yet yesterday they put out a document - a policy document which is not their policy - which says they are no longer going to have a cap-and-trade scheme.Having got through the last election, we have identified seven sets of different reasons those opposite have put forward for not having a policy on an emissions trading scheme. And it goes on and on and on. Yet we get to today and, in the week that the parliament is required to vote on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme - despite 12 years of inaction, despite seven sets of excuses as to why they needed one document or another to be publicly produced to have the basis for putting out their own policy on an emissions trading scheme - we have nothing.The Leader of the Opposition poses a question about what I will not say is his 'alternative proposal', because it is a nonproposal. It is a nonpolicy, but he has nonetheless made reference to it. What is its core proposition? Its core proposition is along these lines: that you can increase your emissions target while requiring the electricity and emissions-intensive sectors of the economy to do less. These together represent some 56 per cent of total emissions in the Australian economy, so he says that on the one hand you can increase Australia's emissions targets while requiring these two critical sectors of the Australian economy, representing 56 per cent of total emissions, to do less. That is the first proposition.The second proposition is on the cost of the regime. That is that they will produce a scheme based on this model - perhaps, depending on what the policy ultimately is - which will actually cost less than a carbon pollution reduction scheme, and they say it will cost less than a carbon pollution reduction scheme despite the fact that they are going to provide more by way of financial assistance to the emissions-intensive trade-exposed sector and more by way of financial assistance to the coal industry as well. So it will cost less while paying more. This does not represent a policy on climate change. This is the Liberal Party's magic pudding - that is, you can actually claim to increase your targets while requiring the key sectors in the economy generating emissions to do less and saying at the same time that you can produce a system which will cost less while providing more direct financial assistance to two of the directly affected and most important sectors of the economy.This is an absolute rolled gold, unreconstructed Liberal Party magic pudding from central casting. The reason why we do not have a policy, of course, is transparent. That is because there is no unity behind policy on their part, as far as the Liberal Party and the National Party are concerned. What we have had, therefore, is not an exercise in policy for the long term. It is an exercise in short-term politics aimed at one single objective: to paper over the enormous divide which exists between the Liberal Party and the National Party within the coalition on an alternative approach to carbon pollution reduction.The government's policy is clear. We have a white paper. We have legislation. It is in the Senate. It is waiting for a vote. Those opposite have run out of excuses. The national interest demands that you come clean and put forward your policy once and for all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Last week the House may recall that I delivered the nation's first National Security Statement to the parliament. In that statement I spoke about national security in terms of freedom from attack or the threat of attack, the maintenance of our territorial integrity and political sovereignty, the preservation of our hard won freedoms and the maintenance of our fundamental capacity to advance economic prosperity for all Australians.Events of recent weeks demonstrate that threats to our national security are real and remain significant. We must therefore continue to be vigilant to ensure the safety of Australians and Australian citizens both at home and abroad. There is no greater responsibility on the part of an Australian government than to protect Australians from threats to our national security. In the current age, this becomes a more difficult proposition as time goes on.Last week in Melbourne a number of people were arrested and charged with terrorism offences. This action was a culmination of an operation which I am advised commenced in January of this year. The operation involved extensive collaboration and the dedication of around 150 officers from the Australian Federal Police, the Victorian and New South Wales police forces, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the New South Wales Crime Commission and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Nineteen search warrants were executed in and around Melbourne and several items, including computers and removable data storage, were seized. Five men have been charged with terrorism offences and remanded in custody.I am advised that the charges against the five men relate to offences against the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Two of the men have also been charged with offences against the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. Now that arrests have been made and charges laid, it is inappropriate to comment further on the individuals or the ongoing investigation. Those charged are entitled to the presumption of innocence. I would, however, like to acknowledge the work of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies in conducting this operation. The joint operation in Melbourne is testimony to the current levels of cooperation between the intelligence and law enforcement agencies of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments.The national counterterrorism level remains at medium. It has been at that level since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. The Australian government is committed to the task of combating terrorism. This requires a combination of an appropriate security response to individual incidents while broader strategies are also implemented to enhance community cohesion and lessen the appeal of radical ideology.The government has a number of initiatives currently underway. First, the government is committed to ensuring the focus of Australia's national security and counterterrorism laws remains on preventing a terrorist attack from occurring in the first place. As I have said, this is a difficult challenge. We cannot adopt a position which involves us simply waiting to punish those who commit terrorist acts and related crimes after they occur. We must do whatever we can to prevent such attacks from occurring. The government will therefore shortly be releasing a discussion paper on amendments to the Australian national security and counterterrorism laws. The discussion paper will help to establish an effective legal framework, which is fundamental to our ability to manage and respond to the challenges we now confront in our increasingly complex security environment.Second, the Attorney-General has recently announced measures directed at dealing with counterterrorism. The measures are designed to deepen our engagement with at-risk communities to support them in resisting extremism. In addition to influencing individuals who may be affected by radical ideology, a national approach to countering extremism is critical and will form an integral prevention mechanism in Australia's national counterterrorism strategy.Third, the Special Minister of State has introduced legislation to establish a national security legislation monitor. The monitor will review the practical operation, effectiveness and implications for national security of our counterterrorism legislation on an annual basis. The monitor will be independent and consider whether legislation adequately protects public safety without reducing public freedoms.Furthermore, in last year's National Security Statement I commented that the government would be developing a counterterrorism white paper. The white paper will respond to the continuing threat to Australia from terrorism. The white paper will include recommendations to adjust our current policy arrangements where required, with consideration to arrangements both at home and abroad. I expect to release the white paper later this year.Beyond these measures it is of critical importance, of course, to maintain proper provisioning of resources for our security, police and intelligence agencies to ensure that the work that they confront on a weekly basis can be properly discharged. On that basis, the government maintains a close and continuing dialogue with our services about their future resourcing needs.The events of recent weeks both in Melbourne and the tragic bombings in Jakarta are yet another reminder to us all that we face an enduring threat from terrorism both here in Australia and abroad. All Australians are rightly concerned. I wish to reassure Australians that the government and our law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies will continue to work hard to exert every effort to combat terrorism and to respond to new threats as they arise in our security environment at home and abroad.</DOC>

 - Again I would note in my response to this question what I said in response to the last question, which was that the government finds itself two days before a vote in the Senate responding to a non-policy. Those opposite were asked yesterday, 'Was the document produced by Frontier Economics representative of coalition policy?' The answer was, 'No, it is not coalition policy.' We seem to be again having this debate in a policy vacuum.The honourable member raises a question about the impact on employment. Treasury modelling shows that Australia can continue to achieve strong trend economic growth while making deep cuts in emissions through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and that almost all industry sectors across the Australian economy will continue to grow. I would also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that, consistent with this, national employment is projected to increase by 1.7 million jobs from 2008 to 2020 and by 4.7 million jobs by 2050 while carbon pollution allocation levels are projected to fall by at least 60 per cent from 2000 levels in 2050. Furthermore, average income is projected to increase by at least $4,300 per person over the 12 years from 2008 to 2020 with strong real trend GDP and GNP growth.The Treasury modelling also points out that by 2050 the renewable energy sector will be 30 times larger than it is today. Furthermore, a 2009 study by the Climate Institute shows that there are some $31 billion worth of clean energy projects already underway or planned in response to the government's climate change policies. This will generate around 26,000 new jobs, mostly in regional areas: 2,500 permanent jobs, 15,000 construction jobs and 8,600 indirect jobs in supporting sectors.I would also draw to the honourable member's attention - given his recent interest in climate change, because I cannot recall many questions from the honourable member up until now on this matter - to what Treasury modelling also said in October 2008: that economies that defer action on climate change face long-term costs around 15 per cent higher than those that take action now. The honourable member will be familiar with the impact of climate change on critical regions like North and Far North Queensland vis-a-vis the amount of employment which is generated out of the Great Barrier Reef. There are 50,000 people whose employment derives from the Great Barrier Reef with $5 billion in tourism revenue, not to mention the 90,000 people who are employed in agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin. Therefore, in terms of the employment impacts, I would draw the honourable member's attention to what we have said through the Treasury's modelling of the employment impact of the CPRS. Furthermore, can I draw the honourable member's attention to what would happen if we simply continued the policy of those opposite for the previous 12 years, which was to do nothing. That is the consequence of inaction and the cost to the economy and to jobs and income.The honourable member also in his question again makes reference to this document produced by Frontier Economics. I would draw the honourable member's attention and the House's attention to the fact that the BCA, the Business Council of Australia, through its spokesman has said:The BCA is concerned that a baseline and credit model will bring additional uncertainty over time as such an approach may require changes to the baselines to achieve emissions targets and quantum and timing of such changes is unknown.I would also draw the honourable member's attention, given he has raised the question of Frontier Economics and their report - which is their report but not opposition policy - to the Energy Supply Association of Australia, which also says:A baseline and credits scheme would also be enormously administratively complex.That is the response of the Business Council of Australia and the Energy Supply Association of Australia. Can I also say that when you look at other analyses which have been put forward in relation to this proposed alternative there is not an enormous chorus line of support for it. - The comments from the BCA are dated 10 August. I just draw that to the honourable gentleman's attention. Can I also say that there is a wider problem which those opposite have - if it is their policy, depending on what day of the week it is - because they would be embarking upon a model which has not been embraced by the G8 economies. The G8 leaders in July specifically endorsed cap-and-trade schemes and committed to increasing cooperation to expand carbon markets and to align trading schemes.I also say to those opposite that they would be embarking upon a course of action whereby you have this Liberal Party magic pudding scheme on the one hand and then Australia, the United States, New Zealand, the European Union all moving in the other direction when it comes to a cap and trade. So you have the G8 come out and specifically endorse a cap-and-trade approach. You have the major economies of Europe, the United States, Australia and New Zealand - our part of the world - moving in the direction of a cap and trade, and this is of vital importance because you need international connectedness between systems. Those opposite perhaps have not thought about that as well.I go back to a fundamental point, which is called consistency of policy. Those opposite are now embarking upon this alternative model, it seems, if in fact it is their policy, but prior to the last election we had this statement from the Leader of the Opposition:Speaking on behalf of the Liberal Party - and I assume he was the Liberal Party environment minister at the time - we have committed to a cap and trade emissions trading scheme.That is what the Liberal Party committed to prior to the last election and then the gentleman who has just asked the question, the member for Goldstein, said on 9 November 2008:We support a cap and trade scheme.Member for Goldstein, if you said on 9 November 2008, 'We support a cap-and-trade scheme,' how could you therefore stand up in the House today and support a non-cap-and-trade scheme? - I see. They are saying it is a sort of cap-and-trade scheme - maybe - except that no-one else actually embraces that. I also quote the member for North Sydney, who said in July 2009:The Liberals in Parliament today are ready to sit down with the Prime Minister and negotiate a cap and trade scheme that delivers the best outcomes for Australian jobs _So you have the Liberal Party prior to the election and subsequent to the election saying that they are going to have a cap-and-trade scheme. You have the rest of the world as far as the developed economies are concerned adopting cap-and-trade schemes, but now in an attempt to paper over the massive divisions which exist on their part we have instead those opposite pretending that they have an alternative model of sorts which, if you subject it to any analysis, is nothing more than a massive magic pudding.Can I say to the member for Goldstein, who now it seems has some responsibility in this area, given that we have not seen a lot of him at the dispatch box on debates on climate change so far, that there are two days to go before the Senate votes on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It would be wonderful for the nation if two days before that vote we actually saw the final detail of Liberal-National Party policy on an emissions trading scheme. Instead, we have a continued excuse for inaction. The country deserves better.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I would report to the House today the NAB's monthly business survey shows a strong increase in business confidence. Business confidence increased by six points to a reading of plus 10. This is the best reading since August '07. The National Australia Bank also noted the importance of the second phase of the government's stimulus package, medium-term infrastructure and improving confidence in a number of sectors. To quote the NAB business survey:It was notable that particularly strong gains were made in manufacturing and construction. These sectors have previously lagged and - I draw the attention of members of the House to this point - are now benefiting from the infrastructure phase of the Government's stimulus package.This comes on the back of strong results in the June quarter. The NAB's business survey recorded business confidence rising sharply - in fact, up 20 points. In particular, the NAB noted that confidence in retail, property and the construction sectors was supported by the government stimulus. Again, I quote the NAB in its survey produced then. It said:Retail, reflecting government stimulus packages reported confidence readings as did property and construction with the latter two sectors benefiting specifically from the first home owners package and low interest rates.Furthermore, today's D&amp;B business confidence survey presents a positive picture of business confidence and expectations. Sales and profit expectations have recorded their biggest one quarter increase since the survey began in 1988. Forty-four per cent of businesses expect an increase in sales and 31 per cent expect an increase in profits.This is in response to the government's nation building for recovery plan but also in response to the actions and decisions taken by individual businesses large and small across the country and the great efforts made by Australian employees in what has been an extraordinarily difficult time for the Australian and the global economy. The government's nation building for recovery plan is built on three phases: initially, cash payments for pensioners, carers, veterans and families to provide that much needed injection into the economy in the last quarter of last year and the first two quarters of this year when, frankly, the global economy was falling through the floor; secondly, the phase which is now underway through the investment in medium-term infrastructure, in particular the largest school modernisation program the country has ever seen; and, thirdly, the long-term infrastructure investment which will include also the rollout of the National Broadband Network. On that point, I note with some pride, as I was recently in the great state of Tasmania, having played a part in the ceremony which saw the beginnings of that rollout happening across Tasmania, and it was good to see the response from those individual local communities who will be connected first through this particular rollout.That is the government's nation building for recovery plan. It is underway. We are implementing it systematically, but it is important also to note for the House and for the country at large that we are by no means out of the woods yet. The global economy is still taking an enormous battering from the impact of the global financial crisis and, therefore, the road to recovery for Australia and the global economy will have many twists and turns and it will be a road where we experience many bumps along the way. The challenge for us all is to make sure that we are laying down the building blocks for the future, the foundation stones for long-term, sustainable growth for the Australian economy. Nation building for recovery is important for the here and now.I acknowledge the fact that there are going to be bumps in the road, as the path to recovery, including rising unemployment, as employment is a lagging indicator, will be with us for quite a while yet, but also it is important to lay in place the building blocks for long-term economic growth, and that means productivity growth. We cannot simply afford to return to the boom and bust economic cycle of the past. We must instead build an alternative model for economic growth for Australia's future. That means investing radically in the long-term drivers of productivity growth. If you dovetail so many of the measures that we have taken - investing in our schools, investing in our universities, investing in our research institutes as well as the other initiatives contained in education, skills and training, the other investments in infrastructure all designed to lift productivity growth and the other work being done by the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy and others in reducing over time the regulatory burden faced by Australian business as we draw together the different regulatory environments of the Commonwealth, the state and the territories - this is part and parcel of building a strategy of long-term sustainable economic growth for Australia which is anchored in raising productivity growth for the long term. The global economy, I believe, faces a very rough period ahead. We cannot simply assume a return to the growth models of the past. Therefore, Australia is going to have to work harder and more effectively and with greater productivity growth to carve a greater slice out of what may be -  -  - I gather that outside this place there is currently storm and tempest. Can I just say that it pales into insignificance compared with the storm and tempest which rages within the ranks of the Liberal Party and the National Party - and, Mr Speaker, there is more light in this chamber now than is currently being brought to bear on the policy on climate change on the part of those opposite.The question I was asked dealt with the confidence data which was out today and its impact on our nation building for recovery plan. My point to the House was this: nation building for recovery is being implemented; we intend to get on with the job of doing that. Secondly, we have to be prepared as a nation and as an economy for the fact that it will be a rough and difficult road ahead and, thirdly, if we are being responsible about it we will also put in place the long-term building blocks for a sustainable economic growth model for Australia for the future.The reality we confront with the global economy is this: we cannot assume that the world will continue to grow for the next decade as it has for the last, because so many of the underpinning assumptions in the global economy for the previous decade will no longer be present in the future - in particular, the global financial imbalances which have underpinned so much of the activity that we have seen over the last decade. Therefore, how do you build a new model of economic growth for the future? The responsible course of action for Australia, the only sure answer to that, is productivity, productivity, productivity. That is the cornerstone of this government's long-term economic development strategy. It is the one we went with to the last election, it is the one we have continued to implement since the election and it is the one that we will now embrace with full vigour going forward to the future as well. It is the right strategy for Australia. We are encouraged by the data which has been released today, but this country is by no means out of the woods yet.</DOC>

 - If we are going to deal with the challenge of climate change it means we have to deal with the price of carbon. Dealing with the price of carbon affects the price of electricity. I draw the attention of those opposite to a statement by my predecessor, the former member for Bennelong and former Prime Minister, who said as much when standing at this dispatch box about the introduction of an emissions trading scheme. For those opposite to pretend that those consequences do not flow frankly suggests they are engaged in politics rather than a real debate about policy. -  - Those opposite scoff at the notion that they may be engaged in a debate about politics at the moment. When it comes to climate change, we have been in this House for a long time now and we have not received a single question from those opposite on climate change. Why? Because they could not organise themselves in a unity ticket in a brown paper bag, let alone come to the dispatch box with an agreed position on climate change. Therefore, for the honourable member to stand at the dispatch box and say that there will be no impact when it comes to electricity prices as a consequence of a CPRS simply is a flight from economic reality which the former Prime Minister of Australia himself embraced when he spoke about the need for this country to move in the direction of an emissions trading scheme - also, I would have thought, a position which those opposite embraced when they themselves, at least it seemed, embraced the need for action on climate change through a cap-and-trade scheme.But those opposite again have intervened on the question of politics. Again, the climate change deniers and the climate change sceptics of the Liberal Party and the National Party are running policy. That is why they cannot reach a concluded position on climate change. For example, remember that one of the leadership aspirants on the part of those opposite, the shadow minister for health - I refer to Mr Abbott - said on 27 July:The point I made about an emissions trading scheme is that I don't like it one little bit.I would have thought that the shadow minister in question -  - Can I just say 'Mr Abbott', because we do lose track of what portfolios those opposite are responsible for. Can I say in relation to -  - I am reliably informed it is the shadow minister for families. But I do recall him recently standing up and launching a book about his future leadership aspirations, among other things. On 27 July he said:The point I made about an emissions trading scheme is that I don't like it one little bit.One would have thought that the shadow minister for families speaks with some authority in terms of the shadow cabinet - but it seems not. And then, of course, we have the member for Goldstein, who has been on his feet this morning. He said that, instead, we should be putting more into proving up the science on climate change. This is the shadow minister whom I thought responsible for bringing forth policy on climate change. His response is that we should be putting more money into proving up the science. - And then we have that extraordinary statement to the Sydney Morning Herald, which is one of my favourites. On 28 July, when asked about an emissions trading scheme, a Liberal source said to Phil Coorey:We were staring at an electoral abyss. We had to pretend we cared.And then, of course, we have the member for Tangney's real position. He says global warming has been exposed as a massive fraud which the public has been duped into believing. His ultimate solution is: 'Why don't we put a shade cloth into orbit?' I believe that says it all.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I do thank the member for Longman for his question. We have had two important reports out in the past week. We have had a report from the International Monetary Fund and we have had the Reserve Bank's Statement on monetary policy. Both of those reports acknowledge and point to the impact of our economic stimulus strategy, which has helped cushion this economy from the worst global recession in over 75 years. The IMF notes:The authorities' timely and significant macro-policy response cushioned the domestic impact of the global financial crisis.They went on to say this:Quick implementation of targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus is providing a sizable boost to domestic demand in 2009 and 2010.Indeed, IMF staff estimate that the government stimulus will raise GDP by about three per cent in 2009 and 2010 relative to what would have happened if the country had sat around and done nothing.The RBA points not only to the government's stimulus as a key factor in supporting the economy and jobs but also to the strong state of our financial system, monetary policy stimulus and the strong recovery in China. The RBA goes on to make a number of very important points about the impact of our stimulus measures. It says household consumption in Australia has been stronger than in a number of other countries, with disposable incomes boosted by government transfer and tax payments. They have been very important in supporting employment and keeping customers going through the door to small businesses, particularly in places like Longman. The RBA says that recently there has been a pickup in spending on some types of plant and equipment, partly in response to temporary tax incentives.And might I say that, as I have moved around the country, those investment allowances have been particularly appreciated by small business, particularly in Lismore, Grafton and a number of other places I visited during the break. They understand the importance of those allowances, even if those opposite do not. Of course, there has also been the impact on housing. Dwelling activity and increased public sector infrastructure spending are also supporting private demand, given the impact of the global recession. You can see it in retail sales, which are up 5.2 per cent since November last year. Finance approvals for new houses are up 55 per cent since last October and public investment expenditure in the pipeline is now at record levels.The IMF goes on to make a very important point. It says that shift into deficit was justified in current circumstances and that Commonwealth government debt is projected to remain low compared with other advanced economies, leaving Australia in an enviable fiscal position by international standards. They go on to say that the government's commitment to return to surpluses and achieve a positive budget balance on average over the medium term is commendable. That is the conclusion of the IMF. Of course, this knocks down the argument, particularly mounted by those opposite, that because the stimulus has been so successful it should be withdrawn. An early withdrawal of stimulus would pull the rug right out from underneath recovery.Both of these reports and their growth estimates are calculated on putting forward the fiscal stimulus that this government has put out there through phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3. The outcome of this is that we have the strongest growth and the second lowest unemployment and lower debt and deficit than any other major advanced economy. As the Prime Minister was saying earlier, this has been possible not just because of economic stimulus but because the country has pulled together - employers and employees. The outcome of that is the strongest growth of any advanced major economy in the world, and we should all take great pride in that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. He asks me about the government's response to this report produced by Frontier Economics. The first response to his question is: those opposite have not adopted it as policy - and they have not adopted it as policy 18 to 20 months into this government's term, having set already some seven precedents as to that which needed to be met before those opposite would frame a policy. In December 2007 they said they had to wait for the Garnaut report to come down before releasing their policy. Then in September 2008 they said they would wait for the Treasury modelling. In September 2008 they then said they would wait for the white paper. In December 2008 they said they would wait for the Pearce report - I wonder what happened to that one. In April 2009 they said they would wait for the Senate inquiry. In May 2009 they said they would wait for the Productivity Commission, forgetting that the Productivity Commission had already made a submission on emissions trading to the Howard government's Shergold report - and remember it dealt with the matter in the previous government. Now they say they have got to wait for Copenhagen and for President Obama's scheme. That is seven separate delaying tactics, and now we have an eighth. Of course, it actually goes to the core politics of those opposite. The reason they are not engaged in long-term policy for the nation is they cannot organise their short-term politics for the Liberal Party.The second answer I would give to the member for North Sydney in response to his question goes back to this proposal, this non proposal, from the Liberal Party - this Liberal Party magic pudding which says you can produce a scheme which costs less than the CPRS while at the same time providing more by way of financial assistance to the emissions-intensive trade-exposed sectors and to the coal industry. That is the magic pudding economics which underpins those opposite - and they ask this parliament why we fail to take their propositions seriously! I believe that those opposite might command some respect if they could organise a position, act in the long-term national economic interest of Australia, provide the Australian business community with the certainty that they ask for and vote for the legislation which currently languishes in the Senate, where they left it to languish as of the last sitting week of the last session of the parliament.</DOC>

 - Australia's national interest is tied to taking strong global action on climate change and taking effective domestic action to reduce greenhouse emissions. The government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme does just that. It serves the national interest. As the Prime Minister has indicated, in two days time it will be voted upon in the Senate. That time is approaching very rapidly for the coalition. The CPRS is underpinned by the compelling international scientific evidence, by numerous reports, by reports produced by the previous government and produced by this government, by the white paper, by the Garnaut review and by the enormously detailed work that has been carried out in developing the CPRS legislation. Two days out from the vote, the coalition are still looking for a miracle solution. They are still peppered with climate change sceptics. The member for O'Connor has been very vocal about this issue in recent days. They are still disunited on the policy and they are still grasping at straws.Only several weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition issued nine very vague principles on the opposition's approach to dealing with climate change. The opposition then urged the government to mimic the steps being undertaken in the United States in the Waxman-Markey legislation. Now, several weeks later, a completely different position emerges. The nine vague principles have been replaced by the presentation of another report, one in which, importantly, the electricity generation sector, which produces about 40 per cent of Australian greenhouse gas emissions, is exempted from the scheme and would operate under a different emissions-intensive scheme. That is as we understand the position. The proposal is riddled with problems and complexity. It is not transparent modelling. The assumptions are not made available. But most telling of all, in the one-hour-and-five-minute press conference that took place yesterday conducted by the Leader of the Opposition, there was one telling moment, and that was the moment when the question came: 'Is this coalition policy?' - and the answer was no.The report is not coalition policy. That is because no unity can be achieved on that side of the parliament about the approach to be taken to deal with climate change. The fact is that, with the vote two days away in the Senate, we are on the cusp of voting on the most significant environmental and economic reform ever undertaken in this country by any government. That side of politics does not know what its position is. It does not have a policy response and it cannot present detailed amendments. It cannot do so. There is chaos and confusion on the Liberal Party side of politics on this issue. Not an iota of policy emerged from the coalition party room meeting today, and we are two days out from the vote. The fact of the matter is: they are too weak, they are divided, they are disunited on this important public policy challenge, and the Leader of the Opposition lacks the authority and lacks the judgment to deal with this issue.The report they released yesterday does not add up. Just consider some of the key elements of it. They say it can deliver 100 per cent free permits to the emissions-intensive trade-exposed sector of the economy - 100 per cent for the EITE industries, 100 per cent protection for all coalmines for their methane emissions - and twice the level of assistance proposed under the CPRS for electricity generators. They propose also to exclude emissions from the energy sector from the scheme and to exclude emissions from agriculture for an indefinite period of time. Those two together are over 50 per cent of our greenhouse gas emissions. They can do all of this while electricity prices are lower and while they double the unconditional target to 10 per cent by 2020.It is not a credible proposition, it is not transparent, it is fundamentally flawed and, importantly, it shifts the risk for achieving Australia's target reductions in emissions onto households, small businesses and taxpayers to meet the targeted cuts through the purchase of international permits. Just this morning, the member for Goldstein conceded that, even were the government to adopt the Frontier report, the Liberal Party could not guarantee that they could vote for it. That is what he said on radio this morning. It is time, two days out from the vote, that the coalition took responsibility for this position and voted for the CPRS in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, because never has an opposition been so exposed on their inability to deliver a consistent position on climate change. Here we are in the very week that the Australian public is waiting for this coalition to bring forward a consistent position on climate change in relation to an emissions trading scheme, and the best that the shadow minister can come up with is a question about a renewable energy target. - How ludicrous is it for the shadow minister to put a question about delaying passage of legislation when they themselves cannot bring themselves to even have a policy about this particular issue? All the failures and the weaknesses of the Leader of the Opposition and the chaos and confusion of the Liberal Party have been in evidence in this past week and are in evidence in this parliament today. They do not even have a policy position on an emissions trading scheme. The predominant public policy debate in this parliament for the last decade about how to deal with climate change has been to have a price in the marketplace through an emissions trading scheme which will enable industries to get on with investing in low-emissions technology, drive the jobs and employment and bring emissions down. They did that work on that side of the House, and the Leader of the Opposition was a part of the process of doing that work when he came into this parliament. Yet, despite all of that, there is no authority whatsoever -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am actually doing just that. I make the point to the House that the member for Flinders on 1 May said that the coalition would announce a more ambitious renewable energy policy than the government's 20 per cent target by 2020. We never saw that. Then on 4 February, as they lined up to oppose the government's energy efficient homes package, the largest rollout of energy efficiency in Australia's history, he said:_ we will come back with more details of an energy efficiency package.We have not seen that one either. So the opposition has not got a policy on renewable energy, which is what this question was about, it has not got a policy on energy efficiency and it has not got a policy on an emissions trading scheme. We have got the ETS; they have got the MPS - the magic pudding scheme. - Mr Speaker, the fact is that this government had a mandate to take comprehensive action on climate change, which included an emissions trading scheme and a renewable energy target, which have been brought into this parliament to be debated and voted on. It is time that the opposition stopped being the flat-earthers of the 21st century and got on with the job of supporting these policies.</DOC>

 - Last week Australia successfully hosted the 40th Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting in Cairns. Can I thank the member for his question and thank him for joining with the mayor of Cairns to welcome delegates to that conference in Cairns, the capital of tropical North Queensland. I thank him for the hospitality he displayed to delegates from the Pacific region.There were important outcomes achieved at the successful forum in economic resilience and development assistance so far as coordination and effectiveness are concerned. Progress was also made on regional economic growth and trade with the agreement to start negotiations on PACER Plus, and Fiji's continuing suspension from the forum was reaffirmed unanimously.A key feature of the forum, of course, was climate change. Pacific island countries have contributed little to the causes of climate change but are amongst the most vulnerable to the worst adverse effects of climate change. Any sea level rise or increase in extreme weather poses real threats to our colleagues in the Pacific islands. If anyone still needed a reason to be concerned and to be urged to act so far as climate change is concerned, then the potential adverse circumstances for our neighbours and the adverse implications for Australia as a consequence of that should be more than a sufficient spur. The forum issued the Pacific leaders' call for action on climate change - and I table that. Consistent with Australia's policy, the Pacific leaders' call for action on climate change called upon world leaders:_ to urgently increase their level of ambition and to give their negotiators fresh mandates to secure a truly effective global agreement _Pacific leaders also called on developed economies to:_ strengthen the seriousness and credibility of their claims at Copenhagen by putting in place domestic policies and legislation now to achieve emission reduction targets.The Leader of the Opposition could learn a few things from the Pacific leaders and their call to action on climate change. He could learn about putting in place domestic policies, he could learn about the importance of having legislation in advance of Copenhagen and he could take a lead from the Pacific island leaders. He does not need more advice from us. Follow our colleagues in the Pacific. - We also heard plenty of free advice to the Leader of the Opposition at the forum not just from Pacific leaders but from other distinguished gentleman there. For example, the Executive Director of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat, Yvo de Boer, said:I think it helps Australia's credibility to say this is the target Australia is willing to commit to and this is how we are going to achieve it. That would be good for the country's credibility.You could learn a bit from Yvo de Boer as well. You could also learn a lot from your conservative colleague - and I choose my words carefully, Malcolm - John Key, the New Zealand Prime Minister. - The Leader of the Opposition could learn a lot from his conservative colleague John Key, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who said, 'In respect of targets and legislation, I think it helps. I think it shows that you're serious.' So the message from our part of the world, the message from the leaders of the Pacific to the Leader of the Opposition is: have a domestic policy and legislate to set targets before Copenhagen. Stop standing in the way of much needed action on climate change. That might actually make a substantial contribution to the Pacific islands.</DOC>

 - The honourable member will be familiar with the arrangements which are outlined in the government's white paper and the statements made since the introduction of the government's legislation. In the government's legislation concerning agriculture, one question goes specifically to our treatment of agriculture, which is that after a period of review we will consider the introduction of agriculture into the scheme in a few years time - I think 2015 is the option we have laid on the table. Secondly, the honourable member asks about the contrast between the Waxman-Markey bill and its treatment of agriculture and other matters and what we have done here. They have constantly said across the board that the US scheme offers greater benefits for industry. Can I simply draw the honourable member's attention to this: the Waxman bill caps free permits at 15 per cent of total permits and the share of free permits will decline over time and, secondly, under the CPRS we will give around 25 per cent of total permits free to emissions-intensive trade-exposed and that share will rise as the sector grows. That is the first point.The second is that those opposite constantly talk about the relative generosity of the Waxman-Markey scheme. The thresholds for assistance are substantially higher under that scheme than they are for the CPRS - 2,500 tonnes per US$1 million of revenue - meaning assistance in the Waxman bill is concentrated to a narrow range of industries and is actually contemplated under the Australian legislation. He should really know what he is talking about when he phrases these questions. -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question, because I know in the complexity of his seat, both the urban parts and the rural parts, that health is a top order issue for him on many occasions and that he and his electorate will have welcomed the final report of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, which was released on 27 July 2009. Members will remember that the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission was established by the Rudd government because we knew that the health system was really struggling after a decade of neglect from the previous government. We inherited from the Howard government a legacy of bed shortages, doctor shortages, nurse shortages and long surgery and dental waiting lists, and we tasked Dr Christine Bennett and her team of experts with conducting a root-and-branch review of our health system and gathering evidence.But we did not just sit back and put up our feet while this work was being done by the commission. We actually rolled up our sleeves and got to work straightaway, investing $64 billion into our public hospitals, an increase of 50 per cent from the previous government's funding. Our work includes $275 million for 31 superclinics across the country - 24 of those contracts have been signed and construction is underway on many of those sites; $600 million for an elective surgery waiting list blitz, with 41,000 procedures delivered in the first year - and we now have 109 hospitals across the country with construction and new equipment being put in place to deliver on long-term improvements for elective surgery; $750 million for our public hospitals in emergency departments, relieving pressure; particular works going on in more than 35 hospitals across the country; and, of course, $3.2 billion from the Health and Hospitals Fund for 32 projects across the country.After 18 months of hard work, the Health Reform Commission has made clear that our health system is now at a tipping point, something that I know many members will be acutely aware of in their electorates, and that the health system is struggling to adapt to the needs of an ageing population and a community which is becoming more prone to chronic disease. So the report makes clear that business as usual is no longer an option for the way we deliver health care into the future. We need to reshape our health system to put more effort into keeping people healthy, stabilising and managing illnesses in the community and strengthening our hospitals for those who need acute care.The report made 123 recommendations; the House will be pleased that I do not intend to read each of them to you. However, there were some key recommendations. They include recommendations such as the Commonwealth takeover of all primary care services, the introduction of an electronic health record for individuals, the strengthening of subacute care, the greater separation of elective and emergency services, national access targets for clinical service delivery and recommendations such as Denticare to completely reform the way dental services are provided in this country.Taken together, the report's recommendations are an opportunity for us to introduce the most fundamental reform to our health system since the introduction of Medicare by Labor 25 years ago. That is why the Prime Minister and I and the government's health team have been crossing the country to consult with health professionals, stakeholders and members of the community and to get their feedback on these recommendations. Six consultations have been held so far, with more to come. The Commonwealth then intends to convene a special COAG meeting to deal with health issues by the end of the year and to report to the states and territories and will then present a reform plan to the states and territories by early 2010. Our preference, of course, is that the states and territories will join us in this work, but, if they do not, we will go to the people seeking a mandate to take over full funding control of our health system.So the scale, scope and importance of this reform underline why we are not going to rush decisions in this health reform debate. We must get these decisions right. It is useful to ask the question: does the Liberal Party, the opposition, have anything to contribute to this health debate? Let us just look very briefly at the evidence we have about the Liberal Party's health policy. Firstly, we know that $64 billion would not have been put into our public hospitals, according to the member for North Sydney, who thought that that was a waste of money. There is no support in the Senate for dental health, which is being blocked by the Liberal Party, and the shadow health minister has made clear that he does not support Denticare, improving access for people to dental services. We have seen flip-flopping, of course, all over the place on prevention issues like our alcopops measure, which the opposition still has not allowed to come on for a vote in the Senate. And, of course, they are opposing the very reasonable positions that we have put to ask those who have more resources to contribute more to their own health care via sensible changes to the Medicare levy surcharge and the private health insurance changes. So not much has changed since 2007, when the Liberal Party went to the election without a health policy; it still does not have one.There is, however, one thing that the member for Dickson has recently said which makes sense. I know it is unusual for me to say there is anything that the member for Dickson has said that makes sense, but there is one thing which, in fairness, I think I should repeat to the House. He, in his modest contributions to the health reform debate, has called on the government not to:_ repeat the same mistakes over the next decade that we've repeated over the last decade.Indeed, and on that point we actually agree. We have a blueprint for reform -  - I think that, when the member for Dickson is big enough to admit - and I am quoting from his interview with Lateline - that they did indeed make many mistakes over the last decades and that they are calling on us not to repeat their mistakes, we can agree on that point. We are going to make sure that we get the decisions right and that we implement health reforms that will improve things not only now and for the next decade but for generations to come. That is what the Rudd government have committed to doing. We have a blueprint for reform. We are absolutely committed to taking and making the tough decisions that will be required. We believe that the public, the clinicians, the nurses and the doctors across this country should have an opportunity to give us their views on these recommendations, and we look forward to making sure that the decisions we make will not be committing the same mistakes as were committed in the decade before.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He comes from that party of renowned climate change believers, the National Party, led by Senator Barnaby Joyce, who was right out there in his full, wholehearted support for the current Leader of the Opposition! I will come back to the question of the impact for household goods and services in a minute. It must have been a doozy of a party meeting this morning. I am just reading from -  -  - As I said before, it must have been a doozy of a party meeting this morning, because I am just reading an online report about what actually transacted in the rolling saga of war and peace. It says:MALCOLM Turnbull has failed to convince doubters in the Coalition partyroom to support his plan for an emissions trading scheme.Then it says:The Opposition - but they are united in one thing. Remember what the member for North Sydney always said: 'One thing that unites the Liberal Party is their hatred of the Labor Party.' They are not united by a policy on climate change; they are united in their opposition to our policy on climate change. - The problem is that they are not internal matters of the Liberal Party; they are now external matters of the Liberal Party because they are canvassed extensively in a piece written by our friend from the Australian upstairs there. It says here:The Opposition will vote against the Rudd Government's ETS legislation in the Senate but it is no closer to finalising its policy position on an emissions trading scheme.It then goes on to say:The spokesman said Mr Turnbull's announcement of the vote was greeted by 'a gratifying grunt of approval'.Mr Speaker, the next time we have a division in this place, let us see how this 'gratifying grunt of approval' which is referred to by those opposite is manifested! The report says:There would be further discussion of the Frontier Economics paper by the Coalition, the spokesman said, but indicated 'general support' for its proposal.Did it have the general support of the National Party? Because that is what the spokesman for the Leader of the Opposition said. -  - It did not, apparently. And then the report goes on to say:This is despite a briefing at the start of a marathon meeting today and yesterday's big bang release by Mr Turnbull of the Frontier Economics modelling of -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. On the question of the impact of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme on the price of carbon and the flow-through impacts on fuel and on energy prices and therefore onto other goods and services in the economy, that is why the Australian government, in releasing its white paper on this, detailed a complete schedule of assistance for low-income families and for middle-income families to assist with adjustment prices for families impacted by the introduction of the scheme. Those opposite pretend that the scheme that they would support would not have an impact on prices in the economy. Is that really what those opposite are arguing, or is that simply a piece of opportunistic politics?The interpretation of 'relevant' has at times been very wide _However, it has been ruled that it must be 'relevant in some way' or 'in part' to the question - that is: how much will the price of a litre of milk go up? I would ask you to refer the Prime Minister back to the question. - I draw the honourable member's attention, as he is engaged on the policy dimensions of this, to what we said at the time that the white paper was released about what we would do to support households in general; pensioners, carers, seniors and other low-income households; middle-income households; as well as motorists. That was clearly outlined in our policy, which we put out in the white paper, a policy which is now legislated - and in a piece of legislation which currently languishes in the Senate.The honourable member also asked the question about the price of milk. I would have thought that, being from the National Party, he might appreciate the fact that, in recent times, we have seen the withdrawal also of the previous government's dairy industry adjustment levy. As a consequence, I am advised by the minister for primary industries, the impact on the price of milk is about 11c a litre, and that is in the other direction. I draw the honourable member's attention to what we have done in terms of our white paper.But what can I say about those opposite? We have seen more discipline in your average riot than we have on the part of the Liberal Party today. Frankly, the country deserves better. As the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Water said, rightly, in parliament today, we have before the Senate one of the most significant pieces of economic and environmental legislation that the parliament has had to engage in, as all sober minded legislatures are around the world. We have a policy; it is in legislation. Those opposite are simply looking for any excuse, any excuse whatsoever, to prevent them from taking a policy position in terms of what this nation needs for emissions trading for the future. Our policy is clear; those opposite have become a rabble.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question, which is the third question that she has asked me in this parliament on small business issues. I would contrast that with the time that has elapsed since the shadow small business minister last asked me a question. Not 100 days, not 200 days, not 300 days, not 400 days but 439 days - 439 days since I last had a question from the shadow minister for small business. Such is his disinterest in the fortunes of small business in this country.The fact is that recent surveys are showing some positive signs, and those signs are emerging in our economy for business in general but for small business especially. I draw the attention of the House to three surveys; one has been mentioned by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer today - the Dun and Bradstreet survey. Christine Christian, the CEO of Dun and Bradstreet, says:The improvement in key indices such as employment and sales expectations is a sign that the economic stimulus has been successful in encouraging household spending.What she is referring to are the sales and profits expectations, which have recorded their greatest increase in the survey's 21-year history. So that is good news - good news for business confidence, good news for small business.There is another survey out today also: the National Australia Bank's Monthly Business Survey and Economic Outlook for July. It says, in part, that business confidence jumped to what is actually the best since August 2007 and is now approaching long-run average levels. So that is good news too - that is very good news.Another survey on small business particularly was released on 6 August, just a few days ago, and was headed 'Small business profitability outlook moves into positive territory for the first time since September 2008'. It says that SMEs are faring better than their larger counterparts, and goes on to say:It's clear that the recent improvement in consumer confidence and actions taken by Federal and State governments has aided the economy and in turn had a flow on benefit to SMEs.That is all good news and, as the Treasurer has indicated, the International Monetary Fund has endorsed the nation-building stimulus package of this government, 70 per cent of which is investment in nation-building infrastructure.As I have said before, confidence is absolutely paramount to our economic recovery. Yet, time and time again, the opposition continues to talk down the economy; indeed, going so far as to claim falsely 154,000 job losses. But since the government was elected total employment has grown by 146,000. So that, too, is good news.We know that there are challenges. We know that the unemployment rate is likely to rise; but the fact is that small businesses are doing a great job in Australia in this respect. They are saying to their staff: 'We want to hold on to you as staff members because you are being loyal to us. You have been loyal to us in the past and we are being loyal to you. When the recovery comes we think that loyalty will be repaid.' That is a great social achievement - and a great economic achievement - for the four million Australians who work in small businesses.We know that the road to recovery will be long and bumpy, but the journey is not helped by the opposition constantly talking down the economy. The government will continue to support small business on the road to recovery and into the building decade. We are all in this together: small business, larger businesses, everyday Australians and the Rudd government. That is everyone - well, almost everyone; the coalition is not in it. The coalition talks the economy down, day in and day out. Get on side, join the Australian people: everyday Australians, large business, small businesses and the Rudd government, and stop the whinging, carping negativity that has characterised every day in opposition by this miserable mob.</DOC>

 - Those opposite, at least up until recently - and based on interjections today, perhaps still - support an emissions trading scheme. In response to my earlier statements that they had backed away from a cap-and-trade, those opposite said that no, they had not.What is the feature of a cap-and-trade? It is that the carbon price changes, and if the carbon price changes - set by the market - accordingly the flow-through impact to the economy changes over time as well. That is the first point, which the honourable member should be familiar with, as I know he is a critical contributor to these deliberations in the shadow cabinet.The second point I would make is that if the honourable member were serious about the measures that we put in place to compensate households, particularly those at the lower end of the income spectrum, for the flow-through impact on goods and services, I would draw his attention to what we have said for the lowest income earners and for middle-income earners and for motorists. It is made explicit in our policy on this matter, and I would draw his attention to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute has, as we would expect of them, published a very solid piece of work and it will make a significant contribution to emergency management policies and practice in Australia. What the report does at the outset is highlight in no uncertain terms that climate change poses a clear and present danger to the national security interests of Australia and Australians. It indicates the extent to which Australians will be exposed to risks to their personal safety and, of course, the risks to the infrastructure of our nation. The report specifically notes that, in his National Security Statement of December 2008, the Prime Minister mentioned that climate change represents a most fundamental risk to national security. Indeed, in large part, that was the basis of the government, in that National Security Statement, adopting an all-hazards approach to national security - an approach which, regrettably, has been shown to be valid because of recent tragedies that we have seen unfold late last year and this year.To deliver on that long-term strategic focus the emergency management sector in my department has been restructured into three divisions. The first division will focus on long-term planning and policy development; the second will focus on training and equipment acquisitions; and the third, the traditional Emergency Management Australia, responds to an immediate crisis. The new structures are assisting in moving beyond what has been described in that report - I believe validly, at least in part, when I took office - as something of a reactive capability to emergency management situations rather than a long-term planning and forward-thinking approach. Many of the other recommendations in the report are also being addressed. For instance, the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management is currently developing a climate change action plan, and that is going to be considered at the November meeting of the council. Also, in April of this year, the Council of Australian Governments, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, agreed on an urgent need for governments around Australia to re-examine Australia's arrangements for managing national disasters. The task force charged with improving oversight and coordination of that natural disaster policy and response arrangements will report to the September 2009 meeting.In the meantime, the Commonwealth and state governments have agreed to implement a national emergency warning system. That was the subject of some deliberation, of course, during the recent royal commission into the Victorian bushfires, again, under the leadership of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has contributed $26 million to establish that national emergency warning system, which we are hoping will be in place in October-November for the start of the bushfire season. At this stage it will focus on the capability of sending messages to billing addresses and to fixed lines, but we have allocated funds to improve that capability in due course and to have it specific-location based. We are also working with Telstra and other interested groups to look at what we can do to show national leadership in the area of triple-0 response capability. Telstra is under an obligation to provide that capability to link those suffering distress to state emergency responders. Also, the Commonwealth and state governments are currently in the process of developing a national catastrophic disaster plan, and indeed a national exercise will be conducted next month as part of the development of that plan. Also, the Attorney-General's Department have been negotiating a national partnership agreement on the disaster resilience program. For the 2009-10 year we have allocated $79.3 million for that purpose.A considerable amount has been undertaken to engage in national security reform at a government level, but in addition we are engaging with the private sector by expanding the role of the trusted information-sharing networks which were developed under the period of the former government, primarily to focus on engaging the private sector to assist in protecting private infrastructure. We are expanding the role of those trusted information-sharing networks to specifically focus, again, on an all-hazards approach and specifically on emergency management. Finally, the report notes the crucial importance of volunteers and that a lot of work is being undertaken at a federal and state level to look at what we can do to encourage, to train and to retain our volunteers. We will shortly be having something to say about that.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It is my sad duty to inform the House that we have some very bad news from Papua New Guinea about this plane crash. At a little before 1 pm today, Australia's High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea advised the foreign minister that he had been informed by Papua New Guinea officials on the ground at the crash site that they had concluded that there were no survivors from the crash. This is distressing news for the families of those concerned. Just before question time, the foreign minister advised me that all eight families have been contacted by Australian government officials to inform them of this tragic turn of events. There were nine Australians killed in this crash. Two of them, a father and daughter, came from the same family.I am sure I speak on behalf of all members when I say that there is a horrible tragedy involved when families send off their loved ones for what they expect to be the experience of a lifetime only for it to turn into a tragedy such as this. I am sure I speak on behalf of all members of the House when I say that our thoughts and our prayers go to the families, friends and loved ones of those who tragically lost their lives in this disaster in Papua New Guinea. Honourable members having stood in their places -

 - I thank the member for her question. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing our deep sympathy and condolences to the families of the nine Australian victims.On a number of occasions at this dispatch box, I have said that, when Australians find themselves in trouble overseas, there is often a limit to what the Australian government can do for them. On this occasion we were able, in our view, to do a lot to assist the Papua New Guinea search and rescue effort. Unfortunately, on this occasion it was with a terrible and tragic outcome. From the moment that we received advice of this terrible accident, our officials in Papua New Guinea at our High Commission in Port Moresby and our officials in our consulate division in Canberra have worked around the clock to seek to ascertain the state of circumstances in Papua New Guinea and to render as much assistance as possible to families in terrible circumstances.I have to advise the House that I have had a number of conversations in my time as foreign minister with our High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Chris Moraitis, and I have had a number over the last 24 hours. It was with a very heavy heart that he advised me shortly before one o'clock that he had received information from Papua New Guinea authorities that PNG police on the ground had confirmed at about 12.30 today that there were no survivors. I indicated to the House earlier today that, when we came into receipt of further information, once the families were advised of that we would advise the House, and I was in a position shortly before question time to advise the Prime Minister of the terrible news.Our officials in Canberra have worked effectively around the clock. The head of our consular section told me he got less than an hour's sleep last night. I spoke to him on the last occasion last night sometime after 10 and spoke to and saw him on the first occasion this morning before 6 am. That reflects the dedication of our officers in the face of these difficulties. In the face of this tragedy, I want to pay a great compliment to the high commissioner and his officers in Papua New Guinea and to the department and its consular staff in Canberra. They have now had to perform the very difficult task of advising eight families on four separate occasions of worsening news and now the worst news possible.Can I just take this opportunity to thank the shadow minister for foreign affairs for her cooperation in this matter, and can I thank the House for the indulgence that they have given on more than one occasion over the last 24 hours.</DOC>

 - The government's concern has not been to provide additional compliance burdens for business. Hence the regimes to support, by way of adjustment, affected industries under both the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the renewable energy target are complementary, and that is why we have embarked upon this process in the way in which we have. If those opposite intend to vote against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in the Senate - I would ask them not to, but if they propose so to do - could I suggest to those opposite that they therefore have an obligation to advance what alternative scheme they have by way of compensation regimes under the renewable energy target. We do not have those before us at the moment. Those which are contained in our legislation are in fact complementary to that of the CPRS, and we have done so with a view to ensuring that the regimes minimise the compliance burden for business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. The Australian government is providing all possible support to the PNG authorities in responding to the accident, and our transport safety agencies are playing an important role. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority's coordination centre has worked with the coordination centre in Port Moresby to provide assistance with search planning. AMSA yesterday deployed a Dornier specialist search and rescue aircraft from Cairns to Port Moresby. This aircraft, of course, undertook some of the searches that were undertaken late yesterday and this morning. It will continue to be involved in operations in PNG today.The Australian Transport Safety Bureau will be deploying four specialist investigators this afternoon at 3 pm on a Defence aircraft from Richmond. The ATSB investigators will include two aircraft engineers, a materials failure specialist and an operations pilot specialist. Under international arrangements, they will act as accredited representatives to the investigation and will provide assistance to the local investigation personal both at the accident site and in relation to the collection and analysis of other relevant evidence. As this situation develops, of course, Australia's transport safety agencies stand ready to offer any further assistance whatsoever as requested by the Papua New Guinea government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The first part of the answer lies with the need for the business community to have business certainty. I would draw the honourable member's attention to comments from the BCA, the Australian Industry Group, and Shell Australia and a range of other businesses calling for certainty on the CPRS so that they can plan their investments. The chairman of Shell Australia has said:_ we believe a far greater risk is that Australia misses the opportunity to put a policy framework in place to deal with this issue. This would create a climate of continuing uncertainty for industry and potentially delay the massive investments _ required _I would also refer to comments by the Australian Industry Group, who have said:Business also needs to be making some very big decisions if we're going to be able to make the transition to the CPRS, and to do so they need certainty. Uncertainty is death for business.Furthermore, I refer to a comment from the Business Council of Australia:To drag on the debate whilst we have got this global financial crisis is just one more complexity that business has got to factor into its planning cycle, and for some businesses it could be the straw that breaks the camel's backAnd furthermore, I would draw the honourable member's attention to comments just the other day by the executive director of the UNFCCC secretariat, who stated, 'I think it helps Australia's credibility to say that this is the target Australia is willing to commit to and this is how we are going to achieve it. And that will be good for the country's credibility.'I would also say to the honourable member that the Leader of the Opposition had earlier said the following:_'our first-hand experience in implementing _ an emissions trading system' would be of considerable assistance in our international discussions and negotiations aimed at achieving an effective global climate change agreement.I would also note that the previous position of the opposition was that they should move to the implementation of such a regime irrespective of what international action was being contemplated.Again, I would refer to an earlier statement by the Leader of the Opposition, where he said:_ the Howard Government's policy last year, was that we would establish an emissions trading system not later than 2012. It was not conditional on international action. _ John Howard decided and the Cabinet decided last year that we would move on an emissions trading scheme come what may.Therefore, in response to the honourable member's questions, there are two sets of considerations here. One is business certainty, and I have referred to three principal spokesmen of business. The business community is looking for certainty on what is an important set of reforms for the economy for the future. Secondly, I draw the honourable member's attention both to the previous government's and the current Leader of the Opposition's statements on the need to act as underpinning Australia's international credibility, and furthermore to the recent statement by Mr Yvo de Boer, the executive director of the UNFCCC secretariat.</DOC>

 - I can update the House in relation to this issue. The Australian Defence Force is making assets available under Operation Kokoda Assist to aid the Papua New Guinean authorities in relation to this tragedy. This assistance includes HMAS Success with an embarked Sea King helicopter that has been diverted from its current location near the Torres Strait. The Sea King helicopter arrived at Port Moresby this morning and HMAS Success will arrive this afternoon.I am informed that the Sea King departed Port Moresby for the accident site at 10.35 am this morning with a number of people on board, including two police officers and an Australian consul. A Caribou aircraft is currently available in Port Moresby for a separate activity, and was available for tasking from 7 am this morning. The Caribou departed for Kokoda village at 11 am today, carrying a PNG Defence Force infantry contingent and the Australian Deputy Head of Mission. Additionally, a C130 Hercules has departed RAAF Base Richmond this morning with the following capabilities: firstly, a command element led by Wing Commander David Howard; secondly, a medical team; and, thirdly, a six-person mobile air load team, which will be utilised as an incident site support party to assist. Three members of the Australian Federal Police are also on board from the disaster victim identification team.In addition, two Army Black Hawk helicopters from the Sydney area are currently being prepared for movement today by a C17 Globemaster. They are expected to depart Richmond this afternoon if the request is made. Also on this flight will be the remaining 10 members of the Australian Federal Police disaster victim identification team and four members of the Australian Transport Safety Board. Additional Australian Defence Force manpower, including engineering support, may be available if it is required from personnel who are currently deployed to Papua New Guinea. Obviously, the ADF will make every effort to assist the PNG authorities in relation to this tragedy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. In doing so, can I say that the issue of a balanced carbon pollution reduction scheme in association with the Renewable Energy Target has been subject to serious deliberation by the government and the broader community for a considerable period.I am pleased to note that the member for Groom has finally noticed the debate that is occurring in the community at the moment and the requirement for us to actually put in place a system which makes progress on the environmental front whilst also ensuring energy security for Australia. In that context, the operation of the electricity system is of primary importance to the government because energy security is the key to economic activity and growth in the future.I might also say that it is about time the opposition appreciated that they, in government, previously indicated that an introduction of an ETS involved a price on carbon and a rise in the price of electricity so as to change the behaviour of the Australian community, both in households and in the business community. It is for those very reasons that the government have been in detailed discussion with the generators for the purposes of ensuring that we can guarantee energy security in the future and putting in place compensation, which will assist in changing the behaviour of the broader community whilst also minimising the impact on families and people on fixed incomes, such as pensioners.In that context, can I say that if the honourable member for Groom is serious about getting the electricity system right in Australia in respect of the danger of lights going out in the future then he should be arguing in the coalition party room that it is time for us to end this debate so that we finally put in place a price on carbon in association with renewable energy targets. I say that because, as the previous minister, he understands that there are major decisions to be made in Australia in terms of future investment for the purpose of generation capacity which will guarantee energy security in Australia. At the moment, the business community is unable to make those decisions as it has no guarantee as to the investment horizons that will exist in the future because of the failure of the opposition to be serious about this debate. - Can I say in response to the honourable member that the cost of electricity in Australia is very much related to the security of energy, because we are fast approaching the position of peaking in respect of our energy capacity in Australia. That goes to the very requirement to finalise this debate this week. As Minister for Resources and Energy, I require a price on carbon to be determined sooner than later, and I also require a renewable energy target to be in place so as to bring on a further economic stimulus package for a potential huge investment in the renewable energy sector in Australia. By resolving those issues we will not only get security in place but also have a capacity to put in place the necessary compensation to assist low-income families and people on fixed incomes as part of enabling us to make this adjustment to a low-emissions economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question and for her interest in this matter, an interest which I know all members of the House share. As members would be aware, Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was convicted yesterday under the so-called Law Protecting the State Against the Dangers of Subversive Elements. She was sentenced to three years detention with labour, and that was reduced to 1½ years home detention. That sentence, of course, removes any prospect of her taking place in the proposed Burmese 2010 elections and will further detract from the credibility of those elections. Aung San Suu Kyi now faces a further period in detention, having spent almost 14 of the last 20 years in detention.Australia condemns this verdict and this sentence. Yesterday and today we have again called upon the Burmese regime to release Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as the 2,000 other political prisoners in Burma, from detention. That should be done unconditionally and immediately. I relayed these messages to Burmese Foreign Minister Win in person when I saw him in Phuket, Thailand recently for the ASEAN related meetings. I emphasised Australia's disappointment that Burma was again seeming to go down a path of further isolation from the international community. The Burmese foreign minister heard this message not just from me but from other ASEAN foreign ministers and from those foreign ministers who attended the ASEAN Regional Forum, some 26 foreign ministers, and the European Union.We welcome overnight the unanimous international condemnation of the decision. On my instruction today the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade called in the Burmese ambassador at lunchtime and relayed these strong messages on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian people. Our ambassador in Burma is doing likewise. When I met the Burmese foreign minister, I told him that Australia very much regretted Burma's continuing isolation because Australia and the international community wanted to assist Burma's economic and socially deleterious circumstances. But it is of course impossible to effect that unless Burma moves back to democracy. As a first step, I will contact my Thai counterpart, Thai Foreign Minister Kasit, in his capacity as ASEAN chair, to speak about the action which the international community can take.Australia, of course, in addition to supporting international measures, has for some time taken autonomous measures. Australia will soon renew its autonomous financial sanctions, introduced in 2007 and updated in 2008, that target senior members of the regime, their associates and their family members. As a result of Aung San Suu Kyi's trial, conviction and sentencing, when these sanctions are updated I will now give consideration to including senior members of the judiciary as being subject to these sanctions.Since 1991 Australia has maintained and supported a ban on defence exports to Burma. Australia would support any action before the Security Council to place a global arms embargo upon Burma, as urged by the United Kingdom Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. I am also considering other policy responses on behalf of Australia to place additional pressure on Burma.Last night the Prime Minister announced that, in solidarity with Aung San Suu Kyi and the Burmese people, the government and Radio Australia had agreed to establish a Burmese language service to open up a new channel of international contact for the people of Burma. This is a further demonstration that Australia, now and for a considerable period of time under governments of both political persuasions, has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Aung San Suu Kyi and has stood shoulder-to-shoulder for the restoration of democracy and respect for human rights in Burma.I commend the initiatives that I have outlined to the House and I know that they will have the support of all members of the House, all members of the House having for a long period of time supported Australia's efforts on this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question. He is right to point out that we currently do not allow offsets from agricultural soils into the CPRS. He is right to point that out. We have also indicated, I believe, through the minister for climate change, that we would consider this further when there were changes to the international carbon accounting rules which would allow these credits to contribute to our international obligations under the Kyoto protocol. They do not at present. That is the problem. And - if those opposite would understand the difference - we, the Australian government, have ratified the Kyoto protocol. The United States government has not; it is a different regime. That is, therefore, underpinning the difference between us in our treatment of agriculture. Furthermore, it underpins the position which we articulated clearly at the time of the climate change white paper: that these matters would be reviewed generally in 2013 with a view to including agriculture in 2015. The specific reason for the honourable gentleman's question lies with the fact that, under Kyoto, which we ratified, this is not currently counted. The United States have not actually ratified Kyoto and therefore they are, in that sense, outside the regime. That underpins our position and, as I said, the flexibility we have left ourselves for the future on that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question, because the Westpac and Melbourne Institute consumer confidence data today shows that consumer confidence rose again in August, up another 3.7 per cent. Over the past three months consumer confidence has increased by 27.8 per cent - the biggest three-month gain in the history of the series. So the government certainly welcomes this substantial lift in confidence and, of course, the impact it has had on our prospects for recovery. It is a heartening sign that, despite the massive global challenges we all face, Australians are pulling together and looking to the future with confidence. I will just quote some of the lines from the report this morning from the senior economist. He has this to say:The rise extends what had already been an extraordinary rally in confidence over the previous two months.He goes on to make this comment:The current surge _ has seen sentiment rise back into solidly optimistic territory. The Index is now up a staggering 43.6% from its 2008 low, to its highest level in nearly two years. Remarkably, sentiment is now just 1.6% below its 2007 average.If we look at some of the other data, I think we can see the impact of economic stimulus. Retail sales have increased by 5.2 per cent since November last year, and, of course, in other countries they have fallen. The first home owner boost is providing important support to the housing market. Finance for the construction of new houses has increased by 55 per cent since October. And in recent months first home buyers have made up a record share of the housing market. These are the direct impacts of the government's stimulus packages.But we know what makes the stimulus greater than the sum of its parts, and that is the indirect impact that it has on confidence, and I think that is what we are seeing today. As Westpac's Chief Economist, Bill Evans, said last month:The key is not the direct impact of increasing spending capacity _ The key is to restore confidence - and everybody has a role to play in building confidence and working together to meet all of the challenges that are imposed on our nation by this global recession. Ultimately, it is the confidence of Australian consumers and businesses that will provide the spark for the sustained economic recovery. That is why the second and third phases of the government's stimulus package will support this recovery, by providing much-needed infrastructure investment in health, education, transport and clean energy. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, it is pleasing to see the impacts of these investments on business confidence as well. That is particularly the case in the construction and manufacturing sectors.I have made the point before that we will receive much more news in the weeks ahead. There will be good news and there will be bad news before this crisis is behind us. There will be a bumpy road ahead. But it does remain the case that the lift in confidence we see today gives us some heart that Australians have the capacity - that Australians have the resilience - to withstand the worst that the world can throw at us.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question. The short answer to his question is yes. The Minister for Health and Ageing and I at some stage over the next couple of months will work our way to Port Macquarie and do as we have done most recently at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, the Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide, the Townsville Hospital and the Cairns Base Hospital - that is, sit down with the honourable member's local health and hospital community and road-test the recommendations which have been put forward by the Bennett commission of inquiry on the future of the health and hospital system.I noted in particular the contents of his question went in part to the state of accident and emergency and to the state of intensive care. I noted also his question went to the equitable provision of cancer care services and also to the need for better primary health care, and he raised in particular the point concerning GP related services and the possibility of GP superclinics. I am sure the honourable member is now familiar with the contents of the recommendations of the Bennett health reform commission report, and it goes to each of these categories. It goes to: how do we provide better primary health care across the country with more flexible hours and with more GP related services in order partly to take pressure off the acute hospital system, acute care beds and accident and emergency by having more of those concerns, which families legitimately encounter, dealt with in the community through the provision of those services? That is one aspect of it. The second, of course, goes to the proper provision of resources for accident and emergency.The health minister, as the honourable member may be familiar with, recently negotiated a new agreement with the states and territories of some $750 million to provide better access to accident and emergency across the country for the immediate period ahead. I am advised this is the first time that the Commonwealth has so engaged in a specific purpose payment with the states and territories specifically targeted at A&amp;E. We did so about 12 months ago in relation to elective surgery, the first time the Commonwealth has engaged in a specific purpose payment to increase the number of elective surgery treatments. I understand from the health minister that that agreement with the states and territories resulted in an additional 40,000 elective surgery procedures across the country. - She advises me that half a million dollars of that was invested into elective surgery arrangements at Port Macquarie.On cancer related services, the honourable member will be familiar with the fact that in the budget we announced some $1.2 billion worth of cancer related services, because we are deeply concerned about the proper provision of what are called comprehensive cancer care services not just in our large cities but across the country. The honourable member will be familiar with the support which the government has so far provided to what will become the Chris O'Brien centre in Sydney. In Melbourne there has been considerable investment also on our part - in partnership, I believe, with the government of Victoria - in the MacCallum centre, which is being built at Parkville. On top of that, there are investments of a more comprehensive nature in various other health regions across the nation. He is right to say: what is the proper provision of cancer related services in his part of New South Wales? I am sure the consultations which we will undertake in and around Port Macquarie hospital will help inform decisions which are taken in the future on the proper provision of those services as well.We fully understand, based on the advice provided to the government by Dr Bennett's health reform commission report and the 123 recommendations contained within it, that our health and hospital system across the nation is increasingly at a tipping point. The reason for that is that, firstly, we have an increasing population, particularly in the region where the honourable member lives but also in parts of Queensland where I have just been as well - in Far North Queensland, in North Queensland and elsewhere. Secondly, we have, of course, the ageing of the population. We have, thirdly, the increased cost associated with individual medical and hospital treatments and, fourthly, the increasing cost of pharmaceuticals. We therefore need to look at how we better design this system for the future for all Australians, wherever they live - in metropolitan Australia, in regional Australia and in rural Australia, and in remote Australia and our Indigenous communities as well.I commend to all honourable members the report delivered by Dr Bennett and the recommendations contained within it. We will be road-testing those across the country. We look forward to the opportunity to visit the honourable member's hospital at Port Macquarie to specifically get their responses, as we have done most recently in Cairns, Townsville, Adelaide and Sydney, to the recommendations contained in the report. I look forward to organising the details of that with the honourable member through the health minister's office.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question and, in particular, for the advocacy that he shows for the pensioners and families in his electorate. He certainly does understand the benefit that has gone to more than 43,700 pensioners and families through the payments that were made as part of the economic stimulus strategy back in December and the more than 17,000 payments that were made as part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan in March.Australia's pensioners, carers, veterans, people on the disability support pension and families have played a very important role in helping Australia during these very difficult economic times. The latest economic data does tell us that these direct cash payments have helped to cushion the Australian economy from the worst impacts of the global recession.In December the payments went not only to all of the pensioners, carers and families in Longman but to people in other parts of Australia, four million pensioners and around two million families. Then in March the stimulus payments went to around two million families. We certainly know that both pensioners and families did their bit to help people in the retail sector and in other parts of the economy.I have had many letters from and discussions with people about what they did with their stimulus payments. Many pensioners indicated that they were able to visit their families, particularly for Christmas. They were able to visit them interstate and I know that has helped somewhat with the local tourism industry. There were some wonderful pensioners that I met in Parramatta. One lady told me that she employed some local tradies to clean up her garden, fix her fence and do some landscaping. Plenty of other families have indicated to me that they spent the money on whitegoods, a washing machine or a drier, and it was particularly the case that I had many pensioners telling me that they were able to afford extra presents for the grandkids before Christmas.We are now seeing that flow through in the latest information from the Bureau of Statistics. That is telling us that between last November and June this year retail turnover has in fact increased by 5.2 per cent. While we are seeing our retail turnover increase by this substantial level in comparison with similar countries, many other advanced economies have seen their retail turnover fall over the same period. It does demonstrate to us that these direct cash payments have helped. They were timely as we have been told by the International Monetary Fund, but we do know that we have a long way to go. That is why it is very important that the next stage of our stimulus payments are being put into place and that is important for those low-income households who are now benefiting from the significant investment that we are making in social housing. It is important for the low-income families but it is also very significant for the building and construction sector.</DOC>

 - Thank you. It is nice to have a question about health from the shadow minister for health given he has been so absent in this debate. I do not have the precise quote that the minister is referring to; however, I can make absolutely clear to the member and to the House that we are committed to pursuing the measures that we announced in the budget. Some of those are tough measures which are seeking to -  - If the shadow minister would give me the courtesy of letting me finish the answer, he might get an answer. As I say, the government stands absolutely committed to the measures that were announced in the budget. Those measures include some tough decisions and this is one of the decisions that was tough because it changes some existing entitlements. The existing entitlements affected by this, however, are the incomes of the specialists not the benefits to consumers. We absolutely stand by our determination -  - I am answering the question and the point that I am making is that the measures that we stand by are those we announced in the budget. The reason that we stand by them and we seek the support of the Senate, of the opposition, is that these are changes that affect the income of specialists. If those opposite intend to defend the profits of specialists who are highly paid instead of supporting the patients who need services then we will be disagreeing.This is a matter that has been before a Senate committee. We are prepared to look at the recommendations that come from that Senate committee. These are matters, however, that we are determined to pursue because - and the Prime Minister has already commented in his answer to the member for Lyne that we are in a debate about long-term health reform - they do require choices to be made - one of which is whether we are going to defend benefits for patients or protect exorbitant incomes for specialists. We are intending to pursue this measure and, as I have previously said in this House, given that the opposition has committed to supporting all budget measures other than the private health insurance measures, we would expect them to back it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. Earlier this week, on Monday, I met with Dr Ken Boston, a former director-general of education in New South Wales and South Australia and head of England's Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Dr Boston is travelling around the country at the invitation of the Australian Primary Principals Association talking to primary principals about the national debate that is now underway - sparked by the Rudd government's education revolution - on school transparency.This nation has many excellent schools, but international comparisons show that we can do better. For too long, this nation has tolerated an assumption that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are somehow destined to do worse at school. I absolutely reject that assumption, and so should the nation. Every child in every family in this country has the right to achieve highly at school and to get a great education. To do that, we need great teaching, a great curriculum and great family and community support. We know these things can make a difference. But, if we are going to deliver on this potential as a nation, we have to have an honest, open and accurate picture of what is happening in our schools, which school students are in which schools and the differences in our school communities and their needs.Since the Prime Minister called for a new era of transparency late last year, state governments and the non-government school systems have shown that they are ready to take up the challenge. The Tasmanian government has published data about the performance of its schools. It is there for all to see. The Queensland government has published a school report card. The New South Wales government has taken a courageous stand against legislation banning the publication of this information by newspapers and media organisations. We are now in the midst of this, and we need to have an open and fierce debate about where disadvantage lies in our education system. Many Australians would be shocked to learn how little real information is currently available about disadvantage in our education system. To identify which schools are struggling, we need more detailed information about schools and the communities those schools serve.When we were elected, we inherited a system where the federal government did not have accurate data about state schools and disadvantage in those schools. There was information on non-government schools - the SES index - but no comparable information on state schools, even though two-thirds of Australian children are educated in state schools. We are determined to fix that problem. We need to be able to obtain and publish rich, accurate information about our schools - real data about resources, about the background of the student population, about parental income and about literacy and numeracy results. It should not be a matter of a guesstimate as to where disadvantage lies; it should be a matter of indisputable public record. It should not be a matter of convoluted demography and statistics; we should know for sure where we should be investing additional resources, if we care about disadvantage.We will build this transparency system, and new information will be available from 1 January next year. But, to quote Dr Boston, 'Kids only get one chance at school.' Disadvantaged kids have already waited too long for a better education, and we are not going to keep them waiting any longer. That is why we are determined to start delivering our $1.5 billion of new resources to disadvantaged schools. In order to be transparent about how low-SES schools are to be defined and selected to share in the funding of this program, it was agreed by governments to use the information we now have, which is the Australian Bureau of Statistics index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage. That was to be the basis of selecting the initial list of schools for inclusion in the low-SES national partnership. It was also agreed that states would have the flexibility to nominate schools from outside the list if they could provide more accurate information about the nature of schools and where disadvantage was.Using this ABS data, the best we have at this stage, the New South Wales government has published a preliminary list of schools selected to participate in this new partnership. The Rudd government has been clear that this is a list for consultation. Clearly, the limitation of the data available through the ABS is shown by the fact that schools like Claymore and Macquarie Fields are not on this list. It is obvious to everyone who has been to those schools and to those communities, as I have - and the member for Werriwa is intimately familiar with Macquarie Fields - that this data is not giving us the full picture and that these schools and communities need assistance, need our partnership and need our help.We can do better, and we must do better, by pushing ahead with the transparency reforms that are part of the Rudd government's education revolution. Every element of our reform agenda - from transparency to a national curriculum, national testing, teacher quality, literacy and numeracy - is interconnected and absolutely directed to addressing educational disadvantage. There has never been a government in this nation's history more concerned about and determined to address educational disadvantage than this government. Caring about educational disadvantage, and acting to correct it, is a revolution.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. I am very happy to welcome the Auditor-General's performance audit. I am very happy to welcome any level of scrutiny on the Building the Education Revolution program. What proper scrutiny of this program should show, and will show, is that schools around the country are welcoming this program, as schools have been limited in their teaching abilities because of poor school facilities. This is the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. When you speak to principals and school communities, they tell you not only of their level of excitement about the new facilities but also what a difference to teaching practice those new facilities will make. For example, during the winter recess I was able to travel to Western Australia and hold two principal forums over there - and they were not the only principal forums I held in that period. I will give you some examples from the Western Australia forums - and I can hear the member for Hasluck, who was in attendance at one of them. There was a principal who said he had been in teaching for 40 years and would always remember this as the most exciting time of his teaching career. A female principal who came to one of those forums said that, to date, her school has been 'a school in the community' but this money is going to mean that it can be 'a community school', as the new facilities will be used not only for educating students but also, under the community use obligations of the Building the Education Revolution guidelines, to teach parents as well.I welcome any level of scrutiny about this program. It has been my wish that a newspaper would interview all 9,500 principals in this country and publish every word they say. It has been my wish that a reporter from a TV station would go to every one of the 9,500 schools and interview the parents and the children and see what they say. It has been my wish that people would sit with teachers and actually talk to them about the difference in teaching practice these new resources are going to make. This is a part of our education revolution. Building the Education Revolution supports jobs today whilst we build the infrastructure we need for tomorrow.Of course, Building the Education Revolution comes with revolutionary changes throughout education. Transparency has been talked about for decades and is now being delivered. That new transparency is being used to drive new resources into disadvantaged schools. That new transparency and new resourcing for disadvantaged schools is a companion to our new initiatives in teacher quality to bring the best performing teachers to disadvantaged schools. Our new investments in literacy and numeracy will bring new resources - once again, this is driven by transparency so that we know where the biggest problems are - so that kids get the basics in life. This is allied with our agenda in early childhood so that kids come to school better prepared. It is allied with our agenda in vocational education and training and universities, with new money to drive enrolment and educational outcomes, particularly for the most disadvantaged. It is an education revolution throughout, and I welcome every minute of scrutiny of it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for the question. Providing certainty for business investment is a critical element of the government's response to climate change. In the Business Review Weekly just a week or so ago, on 6 August, the Chairman of Shell Australia, Mr Russell Caplan, said delays in putting in place the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme would 'create a climate of continuing uncertainty for industry and potentially delay the massive investments that are required'. The point there is that a delay in the implementation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will create uncertainty for business.The CPRS, as the House is aware, will be voted upon in the Senate tomorrow, and that is an opportunity for the opposition to take responsibility and support this important reform. Instead, as I think is evidenced by some of the questions in question time today, the opposition is still holding onto the report released earlier this week by Frontier Economics to justify further delay in its opposition to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. As we know, that report is not even coalition policy and it is flawed. I would like to draw the attention of the House to one particular example contained in the report, and that is its treatment of coal fugitive emissions. The member for Goldstein has been reported as saying that Frontier's scheme would give 100 per cent protection to coal for their emissions. We can only interpret that comment as implying that all emissions would receive 100 per cent free permits. But when one looks at the Frontier Economics report, it says that the 100 per cent protection is at a best-practice benchmark, and that is that all mines get the same rate of assistance at the best-practice benchmark - somewhat inconsistent with what the shadow minister has remarked.I think it is a safe assumption that best practice means the lowest level of methane emissions in a coalmine, but the report is unclear on this question. If best practice is the least gassy mine, that would represent a carbon liability of just 2c per tonne of saleable coal. The fact of the matter is that some mines have over $20 per tonne of saleable coal in their carbon liability. The question therefore posited is: is it being proposed by the opposition that a gassy mine facing a cost of over $20 per tonne of saleable coal would simply get the baseline 2c assistance? Of course, that would leave many coalmines with a substantial carbon liability. The alternative, if a higher benchmark were set, would be that there would be windfall gains for the least gassy mines.The fact of the matter is that the Frontier report is not transparent on these questions, costs are not provided and it will create more uncertainty. The government's position in relation to this issue delivers certainty for the coal industry. In these circumstances, it is little wonder that the Business Council of Australia is quoted in the Australian today as saying that the scheme proposed by Frontier Economics would 'bring with it a substantial cost that will impact on business operations and particularly government revenues'. Other businesspeople have been in the media today critical of the Frontier report for this reason - it generates further uncertainty in the investment environment.On the verge of the vote in the Senate, I urge the coalition once again to support the government's legislation to tackle climate change and to contribute to the generation of certainty for the business community in the investment environment by doing so.</DOC>

 - I presume the member is referring to some publicity about state government contracting obligations. Can I say in respect of that that various state governments do have obligations for people working on schools. They include things like doing the working with children check - and I presume the member would agree that people who are working in proximity to children ought to acquit such a check. They include checks about things like your occupational health and safety accreditation - once again, things that are appropriate.Can I say to the member, if he is in any doubt about the small business people who are working on schools under this program, I am very happy for him to come with me one day and meet some of them, because as I have gone to schools around the country I have found people from small businesses who are engaged in the rollout of our National School Pride program - of course hitting the ground first - and increasingly engaged in the delivery of rounds 1 and 2 of Primary Schools for the 21st Century, the construction of the major buildings in our primary schools, which are part of the biggest school modernisation program the country has ever seen.We want small business people to be able to access these opportunities. We are working with state governments and block grant authorities as this rolls out. Yes, there are levels of checks and credentials to make sure that people who are working in Australian schools come from reputable businesses and have acquitted necessary checks like the working with children check. I would have thought all members of the House support that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Can I also take this opportunity to acknowledge members of the Australian Youth Forum steering committee who join us in the gallery today. We thank them for their hard work.While I would like to take this opportunity to outline the importance of International Youth Day and this sector of policy, can I first, with some indulgence, just make some comments on why today is also a very sad day, with the news of the passing of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who was the founder and honorary chairperson of the Special Olympics. Eunice founded the Special Olympics in 1968 from her belief in and passion for sport. She understood the power of sport and the rewards that participating in sport could bring to those with an intellectual disability. I am sure that I join with all members of the House, and particularly the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, in giving our condolences to her husband, her five children and her 19 grandchildren, as well as those at Special Olympics Australia, who are grieving a lot today.On a happier note, it is International Youth Day and it is another opportunity for us to acknowledge that, if we are to govern in the long-term interest and prepare this nation for the challenges of the future, youth policy is particularly important. We recognise this. That is why we have acted for young people with issues like the youth compact and in areas like the economy, jobs, training, health and homelessness, just to name a few - because we get that investing in young people is part of our core business as a government.Today I was pleased to release a snapshot of some issues which are of particular relevance to young people, issues which have not traditionally got the attention within our parliaments that they warrant. I would like to briefly share with the House a couple of the findings in the report that I released today, the first ever State of Australia's young people. Specifically the report revealed that one in four young Australians aged 16 to 24 have a mental health disorder, with young people, especially girls, now highlighting self-harm and unhealthy body image as huge emerging issues amongst their generation. It may be very difficult for us to get a grasp on what sort of psychological distress must accompany this behaviour, but what we do know is that 25,000 Australians are admitted to hospital every year after conducting self-harm. We also know that the level of hospitalisation rates for intentional self-harm amongst young Australians increased by 43 per cent between 1996 and 2006, with this increase particularly noticeable amongst young women, with a 51 per cent increase.This is our young Australia. These are some of the real statistics that we have to pay attention to. They are so lost, so isolated, so frustrated that they take to slashing their own flesh or engaging in other forms of self harm and mutilation. These are calls to arms, if ever there were, that governments need to take very seriously the specific issues out there impacting upon young people. Amongst the other findings, we saw that more than a quarter of year 8 Australian students today report that they know somebody who has been cyberbullied, which was another reason why this government recently announced a $3 million pilot to address cyberbullying in our schools. Our report found that teenagers aged 15 to 19 years had the highest hospitalisation rates for acute intoxication from alcohol amongst all age groups, which is another important reason why this government is so committed to our binge-drinking strategy.It is not all doom and gloom. We have a remarkable generation of young people, but I think what these findings show is that it is important that governments make sure that they pay special attention to the new and emerging issues which may not have affected me and may not have affected other members of this House but which are playing a huge role in the lives of young Australians today. We on this side commit to being a government for all Australians, which means that we recommit on International Youth Day to addressing these important issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. No, I do not agree. What I do know is this: if we look at what happened with participation in higher education over the last decade, the percentage of kids from regional and rural Australia participating in uni went down. Anybody who is advocating the current student-financing model should recognise they are not advocating a system that supported regional and rural participation, because the statistics tell you the reverse. The statistics tell you that under that system regional and rural participation went down. When you see statistics like that, I think you have to ask: how can we do better? I think, too, that you have to ask how we can do better when the Bradley review into higher education found that 36 per cent of students who were living at home and receiving youth allowance and were considered independent from their families were in families with incomes of more than $100,000 and 10 per cent of them were in families with incomes of more than $200,000.I understand that the member shares my concern. I suspect he truly does share my concern, and in the face of statistics like that what we have to ask is: how do we get those dollars to students who need them more and for whom it would do more good? As he comes from the electorate of McMillan, I know that his concern is for those students who need to move away from home in order to access an education. What I can say to him in terms of these student-financing reforms, because I am also familiar with the income profile of his electorate, is that what we have done with the family income profile will mean that more families in his electorate will find that they are eligible for student income support for their young people than under the old system, and consequently the need to rely on the independent status is not the same. The independent status became all-important because the family income cut-off points were so low that hardly anybody qualified. We have changed those family income cut-off points. Can I say to the member opposite that for concerned constituents there is an estimator on our departmental website which enables people to put in their family income, and many find when they do that that they are eligible on the basis of family income without needing to worry about the independence criteria.Can I also say to the member opposite that the scholarship arrangements that we have engaged in mean a huge difference to the number of students that will get a scholarship. Let me give you just one figure. Our student start-up scholarship will go to 146,000 students. The old scholarship went to 12,700 students - that is, it was capped. The number of students who got it were capped and there were students who missed out and got nothing. We are talking about an increase of around 133,700 students getting our start-up scholarship. In addition to that, we are talking about new relocation scholarships. Under the old scholarship arrangements those scholarships too were capped, which meant that some students missed out on them, whereas under our scholarship arrangement people who need to relocate and have qualified for youth allowance will be able to access the relocation allowance. Working through these changes, it means tens of thousands of extra students will benefit, will get student income support for the first time and will get more income support than they would have under the old arrangements.Can I say to the member opposite that if he is concerned about these matters I am more than willing to sit down with him and work through the details. I have done that with other members opposite -  - and we have looked at individual circumstances from their electorate. Often when the debate is driven down to individual family circumstances of their constituents and we work through it, we find that, despite all the campaigning and imagery to the contrary, people will qualify under the new arrangements. More people are going to qualify, more people are going to get scholarships than before. This is a package that is there to deliver for the lower income parts of the country. We know the lower income parts of the country tend to be regional and rural Australia. I know that the member is concerned about his electorate and I would really open the door to him coming and working through individual examples, because this is a system that will be better for many of his constituents.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question and her ongoing concern in regard to terrorism and organised crime. I think everybody in the House would share the government's concern about tackling these very important challenges. Critical to our ability to disrupt terrorist activities and to tackle organised crime is our regime to prevent money laundering and indeed prevent financing of terrorism. This regime relies upon the goodwill and the good work of the private sector, especially the banks, the bullion dealers, the gambling sector and the remittance dealers, who have to ensure the integrity of their arrangements with clients. In reporting suspicious transactions they play a crucial role in identifying the people trying to launder money or indeed trying to finance terrorism. These businesses therefore have to be sure that they identify a customer accurately, that they identify but also verify that identity.I think we all know that identification and the verification of that identity is critical, particularly when this has been processed electronically. Everybody in this chamber and indeed everyone in the country knows that you cannot take an email at face value. Due diligence is required. With respect to business, to establish identity electronically a business must collect the customer's full name, residential address and birth details and then verify that information from separate data sources. It is therefore incumbent upon governments, and indeed this government, to make sure that the responsibilities we are asking of the private sector are not too onerous. But can I say that industry has been calling for access to credit reporting data for the purposes of identity verification. In its submission to the Australian Law Reform Commission review of the Australian privacy law, ING Bank has said that it provides a source to strengthen the match of customers' identity. Veda Advantage submitted that it has a clear public benefit in protecting consumers and businesses from harm. GE Money have suggested it will greatly enhance credit providers' ability to detect and prevent money laundering and fraudulent activities.The Australian Law Reform Commission has recommended that the law be amended to allow businesses to have access to credit reporting data for the purposes of identity verification for counterterrorism and for financing regimes. The government agrees with the commission's recommendation, and I am pleased to announce that we are taking the first steps to give it effect. We are now talking with the privacy groups because we need to get the balance right. We are talking with industry stakeholders to see how we can allow electronic verification whilst continuing to protect people's privacy.This is just another example of how the government takes terrorism and organised crime very seriously. It shows how we are concerned that the government is working with others, listening, taking advice and taking the time to ensure we get the electronic verification right, and then acting.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have listened very careful not only to his comments in the House today on this matter but to his comments over some time on this matter as well. It may be that the honourable member has forgotten the fact that in this place - or, in fact, in his public commentary on climate change - only one year ago he said the following:_ 'our first-hand experience in implementing _ an emissions trading system' would be of considerable assistance in our international discussions and negotiations aimed at achieving an effective global _ agreement.That is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say last year - in other words, that it would be an important stepping stone towards an international agreement. That was the statement last year. The statement as of today is that in fact the Australian action on this should postdate an international agreement at Copenhagen. When we are dealing with something as serious as climate change, I believe consistency is important. The honourable member also goes to another point, which is the basis for their engagement with possible changes to the legislation over time. Can I simply say to the honourable member that a precondition for that is for those opposite to have a policy, and can I say that here we are, 20 months into the history of this government, 12 years after those opposite were confronted with the same reality, and as of -  - 'Twelve years?' the member for North Sydney interjects incredulously. For 12 years those opposite were in power and did not act on an emissions trading scheme. Twenty months into the history of this government, we are therefore 13½ to 14 years on and, as of this day in August 2009, there is no policy from the Liberal Party and the National Party on an emissions trading scheme. Therefore, as we approach the debate - and we have encountered it today in the Senate - those opposite have in fact not had a basis to put forward amendments because they cannot agree on policy.I would say to the honourable member that it is a very disappointing day indeed for Australia when the Liberal Party and the National Party cannot even become united enough to have a single united voice on climate change, let alone a voice which could act in support of this nation's long-term interests on climate change by voting for the legislation in the Senate. Today they have chosen to do the reverse and, as a consequence, put Australia's future on climate change in grave jeopardy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. Yesterday I informed the House that there had been no survivors from Airlines PNG flight CG4684, which crashed in heavy weather and rugged terrain near Kokoda on Tuesday. The nation's shock at this grim news continues to reverberate today. A plane crash is always a tragedy. A plane crash which affects so many people, including so many of our young people embarking on what has become a national pilgrimage, is an even deeper tragedy.The task for the government and for our partners in Papua New Guinea has shifted from the intensive search efforts that took place yesterday, and today the focus is on the process of bringing loved ones back home. I spoke around noon today to Australia's High Commissioner in Papua New Guinea, Chris Moraitis, who briefed me on the efforts going on right now, and I bring them to the attention of the House. There are now seven Australian officials at the crash site, some 1½ kilometres from the village of Isurava on the Kokoda Track. The deputy high commissioner, John Feakes, our consul-general, David Poulter, and the ADF doctor, Lieutenant Commander Simon Winder, arrived at the site yesterday. These officials hiked into the site; they had no alternative. They got there late yesterday after a trek of three to four hours and camped there overnight. They were joined this morning by three AFP officers and one Defence officer. These Australians are assisting the recovery operation that is now underway, an operation that is made more difficult by the rugged terrain and changeable weather conditions of the Owen Stanley Range. Four more AFP officers will arrive at this site this afternoon. The high commissioner has told me they will be winched in from a Black Hawk helicopter, weather permitting. To assist in moving other personnel to the site, a helipad is being cleared by a team from the PNG police, assisted by local villagers.A large number of officials are now involved in the Australian effort in PNG dealing with this tragedy. Some 48 staff of the Australian High Commission are currently working on the crisis. The AFP has deployed 18 additional staff from Australia, and the ADF has deployed around 50 personnel. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has deployed four staff. Centrelink has deployed two counsellors. Emergency Management Australia has deployed an officer as well.The following Australian government assets have been deployed in support of this effort and are available to assist the recovery efforts that go on from day to day: the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Dornier 328 search and rescue plane which helped to locate the crash site yesterday; the ADF Caribou aircraft which carried a PNG Defence Force search and rescue contingent and high commission staff to Kokoda village yesterday afternoon; an RAAF C130, equipped with retrieval equipment, is in Port Moresby; and an RAAF C17 aircraft arrived in Papua New Guinea yesterday with ADF, AFP, air transport investigators and two Black Hawk helicopters on board. The Sea King helicopter aboard HMAS Success has now departed Port Moresby since the Black Hawk helicopters have arrived.In all that is going on we are working closely with our partners in Papua New Guinea. I spoke again yesterday afternoon with the Prime Minister, Sir Michael Somare, and we agreed to continue the close cooperation between the Australian and PNG governments during the recovery phase. He passed on his condolences to the families of the Australians who have been lost in this tragedy. We also pass on our condolences to the families and friends of those citizens from PNG and Japan who lost their lives on that flight.The deep emotion felt in this chamber yesterday - on both sides of the House, government and opposition - was palpable. That emotion is now felt right across the country as we are all touched by what has indeed been a national tragedy. Uppermost in our thoughts, still, are the families and friends of the nine Australians who have lost their lives. For them the days that lie ahead will be very hard indeed, and I am sure all Australians, particularly those who come from the communities from which they come, will be extending every possible and practical means of comfort and support to them at this most difficult time.</DOC>

And here we are, at this point of the process, where the government's legislation and its plan have been before the nation for such a long period of time, and those opposite have not had a united policy position and, therefore, are in no position to negotiate with the government on any matter of substance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Can I start by associating myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Our thoughts and prayers and our hearts go out to the families, who, of course, in the last 24 hours, have suffered a terrible shock and a terrible loss. But in very many respects now the most difficult period is ahead.As the Prime Minister indicated, we have now moved from a search and rescue operation to a recovery, identification and return of loved ones to Australia operation or process. And this presents very difficult moments for the families concerned and difficult moments for Australia's officials. Australian consular officials in Canberra have been in constant contact with the families. All of the families were contacted again this morning, and that close and regular contact will continue.In the meantime, of course, there is now a meticulous, complicated and complex process which will occur so far as recovery and identification is concerned before one can think of the return of loved ones to Australia. In addition to the legal requirements of Papua New Guinea, there are, of course, international protocols which need to be met. There are also Australian requirements and Japanese requirements. This process always takes much more time than the families would want - much more time than the families would want - and we understand that and should appreciate that from this moment. But this complicated and complex process is required, to meet international standards, so as to ensure that in the end there is no doubt about these circumstances when loved ones are returned to Australia. So our officials will continue to be in very close contact with the families. This morning, explaining the detail of this process to the families commenced.Some of the families have indicated that they may wish to travel to Papua New Guinea at some appropriate moment, and we will, of course, provide all of the necessary facilitation for that and provide every assistance on the ground in Papua New Guinea if they choose to do so. But we will continue to be, through our officers in Canberra and in Papua New Guinea, in close and regular contact with the families, as we do everything that we can to make this very difficult time for them as smooth as humanly possible, as they now are forced to wait some time before their loved ones are returned to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In terms of the projected impact on food and other prices of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, these matters were canvassed extensively in the government's white paper. We have said throughout this, as those opposite have said from time to time in the occasional outburst of candour, that when you introduce a carbon pollution reduction scheme or any other form of emissions trading scheme it will have an effect on the price of carbon and that will flow through into general prices in the economy. That was elementary to the position taken by the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, when he spoke in this place on an emissions trading scheme prior to the last election. That is the first point.The second point goes to how you therefore deal with the impacts which then flow to pensioners, carers, seniors and other low-income households, and to middle-income households as well. I would draw the honourable members' attention to the provisions which have been put forward by the government. Firstly, in the case of pensioners, seniors, carers and veterans, they will receive additional support above indexation to fully meet the expected overall cost of living flowing from the scheme. Furthermore, other low-income households will receive additional support above indexation to fully meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme. Furthermore, as for middle-income households, they will receive additional support above indexation to help meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme. Also, for middle-income earners receiving family tax benefit part A, the government will provide assistance to meet at least half of these costs.We were clear about these matters at the time when the government put forward its policy. If you are having an emissions trading scheme, you are bringing about as a result of that a higher price of carbon and that therefore flows through to the general economy. The responsible course of action then, both for households and for industry, is to create the adjustment mechanisms for them to soften the blow. I would ask those opposite to reflect on this further, given that they do not have a policy on emissions trading. When the Frontier Economics document was released only a couple of days ago, those opposite were asked whether this constituted their policy. They said no, it did not. But I would ask those opposite to tell us where their household compensation scheme is. I may have missed it in terms of the contents of that document. Or are those opposite in fact arguing that if their model which they put forward, but which they do not own, is implemented, it would have no consequences in terms of the price of carbon? I would have thought that if you looked at the proposition being put forward by those opposite, it flows through to the price of carbon and therefore to the price of food and to the price across the general economy as well. So here is the critical question: where is the alternative compensation scheme for households being put forward by those opposite? I cannot find it.</DOC>

 - Today, Australia had an opportunity to embrace the future on climate change and instead we find ourselves, courtesy of the Liberal and National parties, dangerously anchored in the past. The Australian parliament had an opportunity to embrace the future on climate change today and instead the Senate, instructed by the Liberal and National parties, chose to anchor us again in the past. Instead of the next generation of Australians being able to look back on this day in August 2009 as a turning point for the future, they will look back on this day instead as the time when the Liberal and National parties put their own internal disunity ahead of what is necessary for the nation and the next generation of Australians.As we listen to those opposite in recent times, we still hear debates reverberating about whether in fact the science underpinning climate change is valid. I find it remarkable in 2009 that those opposite, replete though they are with climate change sceptics, could still be engaging in such a debate. It is now more than 30 years since the first ever world climate conference called on governments to guard against potential climate change hazards. It has been 20 years since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was formed to produce its first report. It was 17 years ago, in 1992, that the international community acknowledged the importance of tackling climate change when it met at the Rio Earth Summit and created the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In the period in which those opposite were in government, it was in the year 2000 that the previous government released a public consultation paper encouraging early greenhouse abatement action. That was in the year 2000 - nine years ago. In 2003 -  -  - Those opposite interject that they did it. Where is the emissions trading scheme that they claim to have done? In 2003, the previous government released a review of the operation of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Nothing was done. In 2007, former Prime Minister Howard's group on emissions trading released the Shergold report, which recommended an emissions trading scheme for the future and, as we went into the last election, what did those opposite promise to introduce if they were to win? They promised an emissions trading scheme. They then said, through the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources but now Leader of the Opposition:_ to encourage the development of low-emission technologies and a more efficient use of energy. The best approach is through emissions trading; letting the market set the price so that the least cost abatement can be achieved.He went on to say:_ if you throw out a target and you cannot tell business what it's going to cost, what it's going to mean, they'll throw up their arms in dismay. So we have set up a scheme, an emissions trading scheme.That is the scheme against which they voted in the Senate earlier today.The other argument advanced by those opposite is that we need to wait for Copenhagen and see what the rest of the world has done. Could I remind those opposite what they had to say on these matters when they were in government? Again, these are the words of the now Leader of the Opposition. He said only last year:_ the Howard government's policy last year - referring to 2007 - was that we would establish an emissions trading system not later than 2012. It was not conditional on international action _That was the statement made by the now Leader of the Opposition only last year. He said further:_ John Howard decided and the Cabinet decided last year that we would move on an emissions trading scheme come what may.Again, this is the emissions trading scheme which they have voted against in the Senate today. In terms of whether this action should be conditional upon international action, the Howard government's own report, the Shergold report, said the following. I quote what their own report said, and they know it too well. The Shergold report said:_ waiting until a truly global consensus response emerges before imposing an emissions cap will place costs on Australia by increasing business uncertainty and delaying or losing investment. Already there is evidence that investment in key emissions intensive industries and energy infrastructure is being deferred.So, after 12 years, the Liberal Party undertook a promise finally at the last election, armed with the Shergold report, that they would act. What we have seen ever since the election is one rolling litany of excuses for inaction, for one reason alone: they cannot unite themselves to bless themselves, let alone to vote together on any position on climate change.I contrast that shoddy performance on climate change with the posture that we adopted since the last election and the commitments we took to the Australian people. We said to the Australian people prior to the last election that we as our first act in government would ratify the Kyoto protocol. We, the government of Australia, as our first act ratified the Kyoto protocol. It took them years and years and years to procrastinate and to avoid such a basic course of action, and we took it as our first action in government. We also set a target to cut Australia's greenhouse emissions by 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2050; to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply, the equivalent of all household electricity used, would be generated by renewable energy by 2020; that we would establish a national clean coal initiative; that we would establish an Australian solar institute, a geothermal initiative and introduce greenhouse rebates for solar power and solar hot water; and to provide low-interest loans for families to undertake water and energy efficiency improvements at home. We also undertook to introduce a national emissions trading scheme. - In the period since the last election, 18 or 20 months since then, we have been giving effect to each and every one of these commitments. In the last 18 months or so since the election we have acted methodically and comprehensively across this agenda. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme green paper was released way back in June 2008. The Garnaut climate change review was released in September 2008. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme white paper was released in December 2008. The draft Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation was released in March 2009. The renewable energy target legislation was introduced into the parliament, with 20 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. We have held numerous industry consultations. There have been numerous Senate inquiries -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The truth is that this is a very difficult story for those opposite to listen to, because it is 12 years of excuses for inaction and it is now 18 months of further excuses for inaction. What is going on here is very simple. It is not about policy; it is about the internal politics of the coalition. Everyone knows that. Everyone watching this debate knows that that is the truth.As of May 2009, the government had managed to build a wide coalition in support of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. On the side of business we had positive statements of support from both the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group. We also had broad community support from the Climate Institute, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the World Wildlife Fund and others. These are the product of hard work by hardworking ministers on a very difficult and contentious piece of legislation - difficult and contentious in any jurisdiction seeking to legislate in this manner across the world. But one force has held us back from achieving progress on climate change, and that is the old guard of the Liberal Party, now in control of the Liberal Party.Today after so many reports, reviews, consultations and even their election commitment and the aspiration of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people, the Liberal Party have once again chosen to turn their back on the future. Again let us put into absolutely clear and stark context the remarks made on this subject within the last year by the now Leader of the Opposition. He said that the emissions trading scheme is the central mechanism to decarbonise our economy. He said that the biggest element in the fight against climate change has to be an emissions trading scheme. He said that our firsthand experience in implementing an emissions trading scheme would be of considerable assistance for our international negotiations to achieve an effective global agreement. From all these statements of high courage, what has suddenly changed? What has changed between these statements of high principle from the now Leader of the Opposition last year to the absolute collapse in the authority of his leadership this year? It is to do with the fact that there is no authoritative leadership at all within the Liberal Party today, and the nation is suffering as a consequence. Today the Liberal Party of Australia is beholden to the climate change sceptics. Today they are absolutely demonstrating themselves as being prisoners of the past, prisoners of their own internal party disunity. The Liberal Party, prisoners of the past on climate change, prisoners of their own party disunity on climate change, are therefore placing the nation's future at risk. Rather than marking this day as one when the nation actually grasped its future, those opposite have chosen instead to consign Australia to the past.I would appeal to all those who lie within the ranks opposite, as women and men of conscience, to actually overcome the rancid nature of their disunity and to act for the first time in the national interest on climate change.</DOC>

 - Underpinning the position of the question just asked by the honourable member is this: the assumption that the position put out by Frontier Economics does not involve any adjustment to the carbon price. That is in fact the fallacy which is being advanced by those opposite. Will the Leader of the Opposition tell us whether in fact this policy which is not a policy will impact on the carbon price? The government has been upfront about the fact that the introduction of a carbon pollution reduction scheme will have an effect on prices in the economy, and that is why the government has detailed at some considerable length what it would provide by way of assistance for households in transition - and I answered that in response to an earlier question. When it comes to a range of industry sectors, including those which are emissions-intensive trade-exposed and the coal industry, they are also outlined in the government's policy. When it comes to the climate change adjustment fund, the honourable member would also be familiar with the fact that that fund has also been established, particularly to assist with adjustment costs for regions and for small businesses and the business community in adjusting to changes to the carbon price.I say to those opposite, as they now embark on their latest campaign of fear on this - because we know that there are two disciplines which those opposite are good at: fear and smear - that this will advance - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. It is the case that from day one of the Rudd government we announced our intention to introduce a cap-and-trade scheme. It is the case that we have had a green paper, that we have had a white paper and that we have had extensive modelling. It is the case that there is legislation that has been before the parliament for some time. And through all of that discussion with the Australian people, and most particularly with the business community, there has been one theme. What the country needs, what the business community requires, is certainty. They require certainty because they require certainty for investment. Investment, of course, goes to the very core of job creation in a low-pollution economy. What the government is doing is putting in place a scheme which will set this country up for the future. And what we get from those opposite is just a completely negative approach. What we have seen in here today is how divided and how delusional they are - completely divided, completely delusional and completely incapable of constructing an alternative policy which goes to the very core of future prosperity in this country and where our children and our grandchildren will get jobs.You would think, when there is such a big issue of such national importance, that those opposite could rise above their division and come to the table and do something constructive. But they have not done that. They have got the hide to come into this House and pretend that they have a policy when they do not. Just today in the House two of the questions have been from the National Party, who are absolutely opposed to any scheme at all. We have seen both sides of the argument already. Business want to move forward with confidence while those opposite want to leave them in the past. They want to chain business to the past by their refusal to discuss and put forward a positive alternative. That is the problem we have, because there can be no certainty when those opposite do not have any alternative amendments - and they do not. And, of course, there can be no certainty when there are no targets. It was made very clear when their shadow minister, Mr Danny Price, who does not sit in this House but who appeared with the Leader of the Opposition, said that there would be moving targets and that there could be fewer permits if things changed in the electricity industry. Of course, what that means is that, if things were to change in the electricity industry, the rest of the business community, the rest of the economy, would pay the price. This scheme that the government has put forward is in the national interest. Those opposite are voting against certainty, confidence and jobs - and for that they should be condemned.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. The government has been involved in detailed discussions over the last 20 months about ensuring that, as a result of the introduction of the CPRS and the renewable energy target, we ensure the competitiveness of our trade-exposed industries. Our coal industry is well placed for expansion and to seize major export opportunities not only in Japan and China but also in a range of other markets. In terms of the coal industry, there has been an engagement and there will continue to be engagement with respect to the final framework of both the CPRS and the renewable energy legislation. In the context of those discussions, we are about guaranteeing the continued competitiveness of Australian industry. -  - At least industry understands that, with respect to the government, there is something concrete to discuss and focus on. I compare that to the opposition, who had 12 years to get a low-emissions economy in place and failed to produce any practical proposal for consideration by industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. The government has an unequivocal mandate to take action on climate change. It is critical for our environment, it is critical for our society, it is critical for our economy and it is critical for future generations. Underpinning the government's commitment is respect for the overwhelming scientific evidence. The government, along with the other 191 countries that have ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, respects the science. Yesterday I updated the House on the available scientific evidence. Importantly, in that evidence it is overwhelming that human induced emissions are responsible for the observed warming. Without action, temperatures could rise by up to five or six degrees by the end of the century, which would obviously have extremely serious consequences. For that reason it is vital to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation so that we can begin to reduce emissions.But today in the Senate the opposition failed the Australian people, failed Australian business and failed the environment. They failed to stand up in the national interest and they failed to support the most significant economic and environmental reform ever undertaken in this country. They failed to support action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our economy. As a result, investment opportunities in renewable and clean energy will be lost. It is absolutely clear why those opposite do not support action on climate change. It is because they cannot agree on a policy. There is a foundational issue at the heart of the coalition's disunity, and that is the climate science. Many amongst the opposition do not respect the science. The coalition contributions to the Senate debate have been extremely instructive on this issue. Senators from the opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Minchin, and Senators Bernardi, Bushby, Joyce and others have proudly touted their refusal to respect the climate science. Senator Minchin had this to say:_ this whole extraordinary scheme _ is based on the as yet unproven assertion that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are the main driver of global warming.He has denied the climate science. What an extraordinary contribution! While the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Liberal Party in this chamber, is on the record accepting the climate science, the leader of the Liberals in the Senate refuses to respect it. And it is not only Senator Minchin who has made some extraordinary contributions in the last couple of days. None other than the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, yesterday on breakfast television said this:_ climate change is real _ whether it's made by human beings or not, that's open to dispute _Yet another one! -  - The member for North Sydney may be looking at the numbers, but I fancy he has been hanging out with Uncle Wilson! That is what has been going on. The opposition are the voice of the past; they cannot come to grips with the future. This government will take this country into the future. This is a reform that is vital for our environment, vital for our economy and vital for our communities. The determination of this government to make this reform should not be underestimated - and make it we will!</DOC>

 - It is a sad thing to watch a leader's credibility disappearing through the carpet. A leader's credibility disappearing through the carpet on something as important to the nation as climate change, and with profound consequences for the Senate, is a tragedy for us all, because it goes to whether or not we are going to have certainty for business and certainty for the economy for the future.What I say to the Leader of the Opposition, as he lifts the volume in order to camouflage the absence of substance in his contribution to this debate, because his leadership authority has collapsed on climate change and across the board, is as follows: if those opposite were serious about having a policy position to advance in the Senate debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, why did they not move an amendment? Where is the policy? If those opposite are serious about change to the legislation, where is the policy; where are the amendments? Neither of them exist, because this is one huge political fig leaf to cover up one core political fact - it is to paper over the terminal divisions within the Liberal Party. That is what it is all about. The fact that they cannot summon up a common position to take decisive action on climate change - 20 months into this government's life and through multiple reports in the public domain about our course of action for the future - demonstrates one thing and one thing alone: a collapsed leadership.What we have seen today, as I said in my earlier remarks, is the return of the Liberal Party old guard on climate change. We see a victory for Wilson Tuckey and all the voices of the past on climate change and we see the Liberal Party abandoning what this nation needs for the future on climate change. We will get on with the business of reforming for the future, as the Liberals languish in the debates of the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for the question and acknowledge her interest in the issue. There was a rally today, I know, from a group called the Climate Sceptics, a group calling itself the world's first political party to be upfront about its doubts on anthropogenic global warming. I presume the member for O'Connor attended. He seems to have gone strangely quiet.The concept that a price on carbon is something brand new in one sense is wrong. There has always been a price on carbon. The problem has been that people have been willing to forward that bill to the next generation. What we had today was an attempt from the government to change the way we deal with that in the future, while we have an opposition, with people like the member for O'Connor, willing to remain in the neglect of the past. The member for Higgins, on radio, has referred to the report that has been thrown about but not adopted by the opposition and said:Technically speaking, if you build in particular assumptions you can get any outcome you want.In the same way that he used to question modelling that he was provided with, he said:I would take the same caution in relation to Frontier Economics.One of the assumptions that is in that report is that you can easily include agricultural offsets at the moment. There are real challenges in the science of doing that at the moment, and Australia is in quite a different position to the United States on this, for a number of reasons. First of all, the fact that the United States have not ratified Kyoto means that they are not bothered by the concept that their agricultural offsets will not be internationally tradeable. We want to have a system where offsets are internationally tradeable. - I presume the Leader of the Nationals is referring to the Chicago Climate Exchange. Come in, spinner. We will get to that at the end.The nature of our landscape is that it has very different types of soils to what we find in the United States. Concepts that have been put out during this debate as being incredibly simple, as wonderful solutions that you can just immediately apply - such as biochar across the continent, such as looking at the size of our landscape and saying, 'That's an immediate sequestration opportunity' - are far more complex in a nation which has the amount of desert that we have. It is far more complex with the limitations on the science matching carbon sequestration in many of those soils. That is why the government are investing the way we are in the Climate Change Research Program, in making sure that we can improve the quality of that science.That is also why we are working to improve the international accounting mechanisms, which currently mean that, if we were to include our agricultural offsets in international trading, we would be including natural causes with man-made causes, which would mean we would be paying penalties following the Victorian bushfires for the loss of carbon from the soil. That is what it means under the current rules, and yet that is what the other side are saying you can do so simply already.While we do not agree on everything, that is why David Crombie, the head of the NFF, in his op-ed in the Land today, said, 'It's hard to trade what can't be measured.' There are massive limitations at the moment. The government are pursuing them and putting money on the table to improve research. It is now happening around the nation, in the electorates of many of the people around here, where we are now working at improving the number of options for farmers and improving the measurement processes that are there.But there are those who want to say it is simple and those who want to say, 'Just look at the model of the Chicago Climate Exchange; that shows how easily you can do it.' That is what the Leader of the Nationals just interjected. That is what the Leader of the Opposition himself said on 26 May. He said:_ the Coalition proposes the establishment of a Government-authorised voluntary carbon market from 1 January, 2010 based on the Chicago Climate Exchange.We hear fear campaigns around some of the modelling thrown around in this debate. When they want to raise fear levels, the modelling of the price per tonne of carbon goes all the way up. It goes well beyond $10, $20 or $25. I have heard figures of $45 and $50 per tonne thrown around. On the Chicago Climate Exchange today, the value of soil carbon - which is what they say will provide this great line of income for farmers - is trading at 40c a tonne. The voluntary market - which they are proposing should be put in and saying would provide a simple solution and an automatic line of credit for farmers - is, on the current science and with the limitations on international trading, delivering something in the order of 40c a tonne. There is a reason why their proposals sound too good to be true, and it is simply that they are.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for the question, and I think I can immediately refute his interpretation of the earlier answer by my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy. The government has had a very clear position in relation to the coal industry from the outset in the development of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. There is a wide variation across the industry in methane emissions, fugitive emissions, on a mine-by-mine basis for geological reasons. To take the sort of proposition that is suggested in the Frontier Economics report that somehow you can have some best practice baseline -  - To take, as is suggested in the Frontier Economics report - which, of course, is not coalition policy, we understand, but which has been vigorously advocated by the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition - the approach that there is some best practice baseline in the coal industry by which assistance can be allocated to coalmines in relation to their fugitive emissions is thoroughly erroneous. The government for that reason has taken the approach of targeting the assistance specifically at those mines which will incur under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme the most substantive carbon liability. - For this reason the government have been targeting the assistance that we have on the table, which is of a quantum of $750 million, to those mines that have the most significant fugitive emissions liability. If the coalition had some view, had a policy position, that was capable of adoption in their own party room, the opportunity has been available to them to articulate it and put it forward for months and months and months. And not one single amendment, not one single policy position, has come from those opposite. -  -  -  -  - The simple fact remains that if there is a concern on the opposition's part about the treatment of the coal industry under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a policy position could have been discussed and adopted in the coalition party room. It could have been put forward in the form of an amendment. The amendment could have been discussed in the context of the Senate considerations or at an earlier stage. But the fact is that they are disunited. They cannot agree on a single policy issue and today they have stood up in the Senate and voted against a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which is the only mechanism by which we are going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country, and they will be held to account for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question. I know she has a strong interest in this issue. The fact is that evidence based policy is important to the Rudd government, including when it comes to a comprehensive environmental and climate change agenda. I think it is worth while pointing out that there is a new approach afoot in the democracies of developing and developed countries which says that we will have a greater emphasis on rigorous public policymaking informed by available and credible evidence. It is a similar approach to that we have seen from the Obama administration in their environment and climate change agenda - guided by evidence, guided by the science.The government are committed to driving reforms based on evidence in tackling genuine priorities in our environment - for example, through targets identified under the Caring for our Country program. Under Caring for our Country we published a business plan last year and called for projects that would address clear evidence based targets. This year my colleague Minister Burke and I have approved over $400 million worth of projects to address these targets. We are driving reforms as well through the National Strategy on Energy Efficiency, which I detailed yesterday to the Built Environment Meets Parliament conference, laying out this government's energy efficiency agenda. - I am very pleased to hear the shadow minister commending me for that speech. Thank you, Shadow Minister; I am glad you were listening. It includes better energy efficiency standards for new homes and commercial buildings, sweeping reforms to minimum standards ratings and assessments for energy efficiency and buildings in the future, mandatory disclosure of energy use for commercial office buildings and national legislation for appliance energy efficiency standards and labels. This is an evidence based agenda. For example, energy efficiency appliances alone are projected to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by some 19.5 million tonnes per year in 2020, the equivalent of taking almost five million cars off the road permanently.Energy efficiency is a key plank in the government's approach to tackling climate change based on the evidence and centred around a price on carbon under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is important to note that this is evidence based because it is guided by the science - report after report peer reviewed by other scientists, and a consensus of the world's leading climate scientists, who have all urged the world to take action on climate change.There is another approach which is in evidence in the opposition and it has come to the fore today in the parliament as the opposition has voted down the government's CPRS. That approach is to discount and reinterpret evidence through an extreme ideological prism. The logical endpoint of that approach is to deny climate change, to delay taking any responsibilities for the challenges that we face. It is the approach of the climate change sceptics. This approach has seen the rejuvenation of some careers of prominent backbenchers and I am thinking of the member for O'Connor whose public pronouncements on this matter have been so evident. He is happy for us to know that his party is voting down climate change legislation in this House. These are the sceptics, the member for O'Connor and others, who are now dominating the Leader of the Opposition - a Leader of the Opposition who has gone from being the environment minister in the former government who wanted the world to know that he would have ratified Kyoto to the leader of a party who, on the very day of the vote on a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, cannot deliver a coherent position.These are the numerous coalition sceptics, too many to name, too many to mention, who we saw yesterday, the day before the CPRS vote would be voted on in the Senate, coming to a presentation on how to stick your heads back in the sand. This is an extraordinary approach when a matter of such importance is before the Australian parliament. Despite years of research and reports we have a coalition that can only present a report that is not their policy and who today have failed the people of Australia.Earlier today I was down at the National Library of Australia with the member for Curtin. We were admiring some relics of the past. Meanwhile, in the Senate, in this parliament, the relics of today were voting against the climate change legislation that we need in this country to satisfactorily address this most important of issues. We are voting for the national interest; they voted for their self-interest. In the face of the huge challenge that is represented by dangerous climate change, the Australian people deserve so much better.</DOC>

 - The government, of course, is extremely concerned to ensure that the coal industry has appropriate treatment in relation to the CPRS. We have been consulting, as my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy said, with the coal industry for some period of time. We are satisfied that the assistance that I referred to in my earlier answer appropriately addresses the assistance that is necessary for the coalmines with the highest methane intensity. Dialogue will continue with the coal industry, as it always does in relation to key policy matters.</DOC>

 - Yesterday the government released a discussion paper which sets out proposed reforms to Australia's national security and counterterrorism laws. The government's intentions, as has been stated, are to give our national security agencies the tools they need to protect the safety and security of Australians, while at the same time ensuring that these laws do not undermine the fundamental rights and freedoms that all citizens enjoy.While these laws were necessarily introduced in an expeditious way in response to immediate crises, it is clear that, regrettably, there is an ongoing need for our national security regime. While we properly equip and tool our national security agencies for the task that they need to do, it is also important to ensure that our laws have the support of the general community as being appropriate, reasonable and balanced. Therefore, I can assure the House that the measures that we have introduced are not motivated by politics. Indeed, I can assure members that a great bulk of the work that has been picked up is in fact work of two committees of the previous parliament, where those opposite had the majority.I will take the opportunity in answering the second part of the honourable member's question, concerning our challenges, to address some of the assertions that have been made by the opposition in relation to resourcing of our national security agencies. This year's budget increased resources to our border protection and national security agencies by $1.3 billion over six years, including $685 million specifically for law enforcement and counterterrorism measures. Within my portfolio alone, some $3.4 billion this financial year has been committed to funding our national security and border protection agencies. This represents an increase of $186 million this year - as I say, for my portfolio alone.It is no secret, however, that the government has insisted that all agencies other than our defence forces achieve efficiencies, without cutting back on front-line capabilities. In that context, I note that the shadow Attorney-General has referred to some efficiencies that have been achieved, for instance, within the budget of the Australian Federal Police. In the context of the Australian Federal Police's budget itself being in the order of just over $1.3 billion, he has referred to efficiencies of $3.2 million and $1.4 million. However, he has failed to mention that these relate to corporate allocations for staff leave liabilities and corporate expenditure in the areas of human resources and finance, not front-line capabilities.The shadow Attorney-General has also pointed to efficiencies totalling some $8.2 million in the economic and special operations portfolio. I am informed that these relate to terminating a program of $4.3 million with respect to intellectual property. I am informed that changes in the calculation of costs associated with the AFP's staff leave liabilities total $1.5 million in savings, and there are anticipated savings of $2.4 million due to the expected conclusion of the oil for food inquiry. I am not going to divert the attention of the House as to how that inquiry came about. By listing and responding to what has been identified by the shadow Attorney-General, it is quite clear that there has been no cutting of funding but indeed a substantial increase in funding to enable our agencies to undertake their front-line capabilities.I also assure members that the Prime Minister himself frequently asks those agencies whether they have the resources that they need to respond to the events that our nation needs them to confront and to properly undertake their duties. Those agencies have always been provided with the resources they need. They have performed and continue to perform an outstanding job. I certainly look forward to the opposition's constructive engagement with these important issues of national security.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is committed to fundamental health and hospital reform. We were elected with a mandate to establish the Health and Hospital Reform Commission. That, led ably by Dr Christine Bennett, reported in the middle of the year. The honourable member is right to reflect on the fact it has contained within it wide-ranging recommendations, 123 in all, which go across the totality of the health and hospital system. I referred to these, in part, in response to a question from the honourable member for Lyne yesterday in relation to the future of the Port Macquarie Base Hospital. These go to what we do for the future of preventative care, primary care, acute hospital beds, subacute care, aged care, dental care and mental health as well.The reasons that we have had to do this are twofold. Firstly, challenges are faced right across all OECD economies at the moment coming from population change, the ageing of the population and increasing costs of medical treatments. These are matters on which the previous government, I am sure, were comprehensively advised in their period in office, which brings me to the second reason: what we saw in 12 years was a big, fat zero in terms of health and hospital reform on the part of those opposite - absolutely zip. Instead, it was the old, old game of playing the blame game with the states. Furthermore, on top of that, not only did they embark upon no program of reform; they instead ripped out $1 billion from the public hospital system of Australia. They ignored the systemic challenges to health systems right across the world. Secondly, they did not even engage in one fundamental reform to the health system themselves despite 12 years in office, with public revenue awash off the back of the mining boom. Thirdly, instead, they ripped $1 billion out of the states. That is the system we have inherited.The honourable member's question also goes to the extent to which we now consult the community to road-test the commission's recommendations with key representatives of the health and hospital system across the country. We believe this is the right approach because the recommendations are far-reaching and, in many respects, quite radical. We would much rather hear from those working at the coalface. That is why the health minister and I have most recently been at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, which I think those opposite would agree has been the subject of some controversy in recent times; the Flinders Medical Centre, which is a major public hospital in Adelaide; most recently at Townsville General Hospital; and, again, at Cairns Base Hospital, which has also been struggling with the huge increase in population of Far North Queensland, the particular complexities which arise from a very large Indigenous community on the cape and the impact on accident and emergency. So we make no apologies for the fact that we will be road-testing these recommendations around the country. We have also said that we would then present proposals to the Commonwealth and states for their consideration. The health minister addressed the process relating to that in her answer to a question on health and hospitals only a day or two ago.I would say this to the honourable member: whether it is health and hospitals reform, whether it is climate change reform, whether it is building the education revolution or whether it is navigating Australia through the global economic recession, this is a government which is on about the task of preparing Australia for the future. Those opposite, for 12 years, languished in the past. Today, what we have seen on such a fundamental issue as climate change is the Liberal and National parties hauling up the white flag and saying, 'It is all too hard,' and pretending this is a serious debate about policy on their side of the House when the reality and the truth is that it is all about the internal politics of the Liberal Party. What we have had today is the most appalling collapse in the authority of the Liberal leadership I have seen in this place since I have been a member. The nation wants leadership for the future, not excuses for inertia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question and for the work that he does for the families in his electorate. The Rudd government are of course committed to doing everything we can to help families and particularly to make sure that we direct that help to those who are in the most need. We have recently announced major new initiatives to support families. For the first time, this country will have a national paid parental leave scheme, a new family support program and a national child protection framework. We have also, in the last two budgets, done some very difficult things to make sure that we are targeting our family payment system to those most in need to make sure that it is sustainable for the future. We on this side of the House know that we have to be, especially in these difficult economic times, responsible for making sure that that assistance is targeted.It does seem that this is not a view shared by those opposite. We know that they have been running around the country scaring the public about debt and deficit, but what they have not told us is that, if they were in government, the level of the deficit would be even higher.I am very pleased to see the member for Warringah back in the House. It is very nice to have him back. He has been out and about touting his book around the country. - This one is from the library. It is definitely from the library. - This is the library copy. It will not be defaced. -  10000 SPEAKER, TheThe SPEAKER - Order! Those on my left will hold their enthusiasm. -  10000 
SPEAKER, TheThe SPEAKER - Order! The House will return to a modicum of order. - It is very nice to see you back, Tony. I know you have been off in the Brisbane Polo Club, no less, selling the book. - I reassure the member for O'Connor that it is from the library.It is great to have the member for Warringah back. We know that this book not only reveals a little bit about their family policy, it does seem to be the member for Warringah's latest effort - I am sure there will be more - at his tilt for the leadership.This book has in it just another clue about how profligate this opposition would be if they ever got into government. He reveals in this book that he, the member for Warringah and the opposition shadow minister for families, wants to abolish the means test for family tax benefit A for children under five. He is nodding! I am glad to see he still agrees with the policy that he put in his book.This would mean an extra cost to the budget bottom line - I will just let the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance know - of $1.8 billion a year. So over the forward estimates that means around an extra $7 billion to the budget bottom line. The question really is -  - The real question is: is this Liberal Party policy? Does the current Leader of the Opposition support this policy? Does he support the government's approach, which is to make sure that family tax benefit is targeted to make sure it is sustainable for the future, or is he having to fall into line with his rival?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I reassure him that I, and this side of the House, take responsibility for lifting the educational standards of every child and I, and this side of the House, take responsibility for combating educational disadvantage. And why do we need to do that? Because under more than a decade of the Howard government no-one ever sat at a desk and thought about what they could do about educational disadvantage. The proof of that is that, on the day we were elected and sworn in as a front bench and as Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, if any of us had called on that day for a list of the thousand most disadvantaged schools in this country it could not have been produced. The Howard government did not care enough to even ask the question.In view of that -  - Faced with this track record of neglect, we stepped up to the plate to take responsibility for making a difference. And how are we making that difference? A new national partnership for disadvantaged schools is part of it. As the member who asked the question would have known if he had listened to my answer yesterday which he sought to misrepresent in this place, the list published about New South Wales is a list for consultation using ABS data - that is true - because what was available was ABS data. What we are doing with our transparency reforms, which are opposed by the Liberals in New South Wales - maybe you should speak to the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales about that - is to build the information we actually need to make sure that educational resources and efforts can be brought to bear, particularly in those schools that need them the most, where students are not getting an education that will serve them well for the rest of their lives and where the kids come from school bearing the disadvantages of a poor background. We are building that.But we were not going to stand by and see another generation of Australian children failed during their education in the way the Howard government failed. We were not going to stand by and say, 'Those kids, who only get one chance at school, can wait for us to build the transparency measures.' We were going to act immediately, and that is why we are acting on the ABS data available to us. Apart from the partnership for disadvantaged schools, we are already moving so that there will be better teachers in disadvantaged schools, better rewarded for being there - that reform is coming to New South Wales; literacy and numeracy money expended where it is needed the most to make a difference to children getting the building blocks of education; a national curriculum of quality right around the country; and early childhood reforms that make sure kids, particularly kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, come to school ready to learn. This is allied with our reforms in vocational education and training and in universities to make a difference for all but most particularly for the most disadvantaged.In the face of that, all we hear from the Liberal Party is whinging and moaning, and the only thing their shadow minister has ever done is put one speech from outside this parliament on his website this year - one speech as shadow minister for education published this year. If you want to be in the education debate, what you have to do is think about ideas that will make a difference, publish them and stand by them. That is what we are doing; that is called 'taking responsibility'. What you are doing is laziness and arrogance, and it shows. No-one is interested in a repeat of the failed Howard years. We are there making a difference with our education revolution, and caring about educational disadvantage in this country is revolutionary.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question, and I know that she cares about fairness and decency at work. On 1 July the government's Fair Work Act came into operation. This is, of course, the act that will make sure Work Choices is buried in a coffin, and the government wants to nail the lid of that coffin shut forever. The Fair Work Act ensures - I quote here one of its objects - that we have a 'guaranteed safety net' that:_ can no longer be undermined by the making of statutory individual employment agreements of any kind.I am asked about reactions to this. Of course, there have been a variety of reactions, but immediately following the promulgation and coming into effect of the Fair Work Act I would have to say the battlelines on fairness and decency at work were well and truly drawn. That is because this book I am holding was published by the member for Warringah - obviously not in the chamber now. But he is a man of uncommon frankness. -  - I would have to say to my colleague that I actually paid for this copy, because the copy was out of the library - Jenny was using the copy in the library. So I have contributed to the sales of this book. But what we see in this book and what we have seen from the member for Warringah is some honesty, finally, on the position of the Liberal Party about Work Choices.We know the present leader of the Liberal Party is cowering. He does not want to face the Work Choices debate, so he says Work Choices is dead. We know that the first alternative leader of the Liberal Party, the member for O'Connor, is making a run for the spot, because there is no-one else so uniquely qualified to lead a party of dinosaurs. He is unbeatable in that comparative advantage. If you want to lead dinosaurs then the member for O'Connor is definitely your man. The second alternative for the position of Leader of the Opposition, the member for Goldstein, is pretty much prepared to fight the Work Choices battle, and he is on the record as saying:Above all, WorkChoices is critical to a strong economy.So, if he stepped up to the plate, the cowering would be over and the Work Choices battle would be on. But you would have to say that the man with the most honesty and gumption when it comes to this debate is the third alternative Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah. When he was giving his round of publicity interviews trying to sell this book, he was asked by Kerry O'Brien on The 7.30 Report:So you do want to revisit WorkChoices?The member for Warringah said:Well, if we are going to have productive workplaces, we can never ring down the curtain on workplace reform.He then went on to say:But things, I suspect, will be a little different by the time the next polling day comes around _ I think people will be readier for reform from us _ than they were at the last election.Then he has added to the 7.30 Report comments today in this House, where he said that he claimed as an important part of productivity 'the ability to offer people a statutory non-union individual contract' - his words, not mine. - I well and truly understand the sensitivity of the member for Sturt about anything that promotes the member for Warringah, who is obviously after his job as Manager of Opposition Business. I have a position in that debate: the member for Warringah would be a lot better at the job. There is no doubt about that. But moving past the member for Sturt's sensitivity, obviously with these quotes from Tony Abbott we are well and truly seeing a return of the Work Choices debate. What I would ask the member for Warringah is: can he really say to the Australian people that Australian workplace agreements that strip away pay and conditions for working people are more appropriate during a global recession? Can he really say that during a global recession what Australians want is Australian workplace agreements that would enable their entitlement to redundancy to be stripped away, which would enable them to be dismissed for no reason at all? I thank the member for Warringah for his honesty, I thank him for the title of his book - Battlelines - because he is absolutely right. When it comes to the debate for fairness and decency at work the battlelines are drawn: this side of the House standing for decency and that side of the House standing, as always, for Work Choices, no matter who leads them and no matter how many of them the Liberal Party goes through.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I do not know whether she should have insulted the member for Macarthur's question, but there we have it. Can I say to the member for Gilmore that the force of our youth allowance reforms is that students will be under less pressure to find work in a gap year - less pressure because more of them will qualify through the parental income test. I absolutely acknowledge that the current system, set up by the Howard government, which saw regional and rural participation rates in higher education go down, is constructed so that young people who want to qualify for youth allowance basically receive the message that the only way they can do that is to take a gap year and work. That situation has come about because the parental income test is so low, people do not qualify on family income, so they take the gap year, find a job and qualify that way. As the member for Gilmore rightly pointed out, the problem with a system that is geared like that is, obviously, that there are parts of our economy where it is much harder for young people to find work, and many regional towns are like that. - The other great vice of that system, as statistics show, is that if young people take a gap year many of them actually do not then go on to do the university course. So what are we trying to do? We are trying through these reforms, through the changes to the parental income test, to enable people in the member for Gilmore's constituency who have family incomes in the low to middle range to qualify upfront for youth allowance. That means you could do year 12 this year and go to uni next year, having qualified - no gap year, no need to worry about getting work. More people will be qualifying that way because of the changes in parental income support.The member for Gilmore would be entitled to ask me: how many people will benefit from these changes? I can tell her: around 100,000 students will benefit from these changes - 68,000 more will qualify, will get money for the first time, and 35,000 will get more money. Then her constituents who would have to move away from home will, as youth allowance recipients, automatically get the benefit of the student start-up scholarship and, if they need to move away from home, get the relocation scholarship. For them, what is that worth in the first year? The relocation scholarship and the student start-up scholarship is worth $6,254, which will enable them to make that transition into the first year of university, plus they will get the youth allowance. That means more people qualifying, getting more money without having to do what the member for Gilmore is worried about and that is look for work in regional towns where it may not be available. Given our concerns, she should be out spruiking these reforms as better reforms for her constituency, because they are.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. He certainly understands that the great challenge of climate change requires a whole-of-government response. That is why this government is determined to deliver on just that. That is why we have delivered the largest ever investment in public transport. That is why we have put to the Senate today the legislation supporting the CPRS. But those opposite have today showed their zero unity by the fact that they could not move any amendments whatsoever and that they have no policy when it comes to climate change. They just do not understand the challenge that is before us. That is because, regardless of the Leader of the Opposition's position on a personal level on climate change, he has had to walk away from that because the dynamic that is leading the opposition is the dynamic of their internal divisions. This is a political coalition that simply cannot move forward. We have seen more discipline in a riot than we see from those opposite when it comes to climate change and these issues.The fact is that the member for O'Connor has had an enormous victory today. The dinosaurs in the opposition are leading the debate on climate change. Today we have seen the future of the Liberal Party and the answer is Wilson Tuckey. That is what we have seen with the actions of the opposition in the Senate - the dinosaurs completely taking over. Behind the Leader of the Opposition we see the triceratops - the three potential leaders. We have Andrew Robb over there, Robbosaurus rex, the climate sceptic, prepared to oppose, or at least be honest about his position. -  - The shadow minister, the great sceptic, said, 'We should be putting more into proving up the science.' That was his position. Then we have the member for North Sydney, who campaigns in his electorate in favour of action on climate change but does the opposite here. Then we have over there the great sceptic, 'People Skills', the member for Warringah, 'Monkosaurus', who has said:The point I made about an emissions trading scheme is that I don't like it one little bit.And that was when he was advocating they should vote for it when it comes back. That was the case for voting for it when it comes back. If you had said at the beginning of this term that Unclesaurus at the back there - as he has been described by the shadow Treasurer - would be leading the debate on climate change, people simply would not have believed you. But the fact is that their disunity is having an impact on Australia. That is the great tragedy. It is holding us back from the future. The Turnbull camp are at war with the Costello camp, the Hockey camp are battling it out with the Abbott camp, the Robb camp cannot work out if it is still in the Turnbull camp and, of course, the Bishop camp has been reduced to a single tent without a pole in a very, very far corner.</DOC>

 - I am unaware of any such request, but I notice that the Leader of the Opposition seems to have had, historically, very close connections with the Treasury - at least parts of it. I say to the honourable gentleman that the reason that the government has embarked upon the Henry review of taxation is so we can have a comprehensive set of options for long-term taxation reform.When the business community gathered in this building at the 2020 Summit last year in March, one of their first requirements of the newly elected government was that it was high time we had a comprehensive review of the future of the taxation system. That was their first ask. One hundred people from the business community from all sides of politics assembled in the Great Hall said, 'What we need is a root and branch review of the system.' That is what is underway. It is the right course of action, and we await the outcome of that report from the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Henry.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the honourable member for Hasluck for her question. I am pleased to advise the House that a number of major resource and energy proposals are being progressed despite the impact of the global economic recession. BHP Billiton continues with a phased expansion of its iron ore operations in the Pilbara and the Rapid Growth Project 4 all but complete. This $2.8 billion investment will enable production to expand by around 26 million tonnes per annum. Initial production is scheduled to commence in the first half of 2010, with the construction phase 90 per cent complete. This project has already generated 900 jobs. BHP's Rapid Growth Project 5 is also underway. This project will increase production of iron ore by about 50 million tonnes per annum at a cost of $7.4 billion. Production from this project is expected to come on stream in the second half of 2011.Woodside's $12 billion Pluto 1 project remains on budget and on schedule and is close to 70 per cent complete. The company expects the first LNG from this project by the end of 2010. Woodside advises that the on-site workforce is expected to peak at around 4,000 workers - 4,000 jobs being generated in our resources sector. The project is currently on course to deliver $6 billion in local content during the construction phase.As members would be aware, there are a number of other gas proposals being advanced in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and in Queensland. One of those is the Gorgon LNG proposal in WA.An opposition member - What do they have to do with you? - Right on cue, one of the members from over there says, 'What's it got to do with you?' Perhaps if the honourable member would sit back, relax and just pop a Mogadon for a minute, he would actually hear what we have got to say. This proposal is being developed by Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell. I understand that the Gorgon partners will consider a final investment decision shortly. This is the largest resource project ever proposed in Australia. Let me say that again: the largest resource project ever proposed in Australia. The total construction expenditure in today's dollars would be close to $50 billion, generating around 6,000 jobs during the construction phase. The project envisages a three-train, 15 million tonnes per annum LNG plant off Barrow Island, off the WA coast. It also proposes a domestic plant and pipeline to supply gas to the WA mainland.The Gorgon project will make an important contribution, assuming it proceeds, to the Australian economy and our energy security for many, many decades. The Gorgon joint venture partners estimate that, over the first 30 years of its life, the project would boost Australian GDP by $65 billion in net present value terms. It is expected that the project would return more than $33 billion to the economy through the use of Australian goods and services over that period. In advance of a final investment decision, the Gorgon project has already entered into contracts worth approximately $2 billion. Last Monday, one of the Gorgon partners, ExxonMobil, signed a sales and purchase agreement with Indian company Petronet LNG.. This is the first ever long-term LNG contract with India - again, something which the economy and the nation should celebrate. It is of itself worth $25 billion.In addition to the contribution this project would make to the Australian economy, to exports and to employment, it would also make an important contribution to the fight against dangerous climate change. As some of the gas fields in the Greater Gorgon gas fields have a high CO2 content, the joint venture partners propose to capture and store that CO2 by injecting it two kilometres into a saline aquifer under Barrow Island. The proposal is to sequester some three million tonnes of CO2 per year. That represents around 130 million tonnes over the life of the project. Gorgon would be the world's largest geological storage operation.Getting a project of this size off the ground involves a lot of hard work and a high level of cooperation not only between the companies involved but between government and the companies involved and between the government in Western Australia and the government in Canberra as well. This great Gorgon project is no exception.There have been three outstanding matters in relation to this project that we have been working on with the government of WA and the joint venture partners to resolve. Those problems are as follows: the finalisation of the necessary environmental assessments and approvals; the issuing of the necessary production licences for the project; and a commitment by government to indemnify the joint venture partners against third-party claims following the closure of the CO2 sequestration project.In relation to the necessary environmental assessments, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has been working closely with the Western Australian government to ensure that these assessments are progressed in both a proper and timely fashion. In relation to the production licences for this project, the Minister for Resources and Energy has been working closely and productively with the joint venture partners to ensure these matters are settled as quickly as possible. And I am pleased to advise the House that the matter relating to the indemnity of the project operator against third-party claims after the sequestration site has closed has now been settled. Both governments have agreed to share the long-term liability. The provision of the indemnity is subject to the Gorgon joint venture partners making a final investment decision this year. It is important that we build on the Commonwealth's existing regulatory framework and that we now develop a regulatory regime around this project that properly protects the interests of both the Commonwealth on the one hand and the Western Australian government on the other hand as well as the broader Australian community.It is appropriate that the Commonwealth government has a direct role in advancing this project given its scale and significance to the Australian economy. It is also appropriate that the Commonwealth has a direct role in advancing this project given the important contribution it will make to promoting carbon capture and storage technology. Finally, the Commonwealth has a direct interest in this project given the environmental significance of Barrow Island. This project would not only contribute to the WA economy; it is a testament to how important the WA economy is to the Australian national economy. The government looks forward to working with the government and people of Western Australia as we seek to bring this project into reality.This is a positive development of a highly complex and capital intensive project. It is a $50 billion investment. That is equivalent to something in the order of five per cent of GDP. This is a very large prospective project. That is why the government has been doing all it can in proper consultation with the joint venture partners. This sort of development is important news for the economy as we chart what is still an uncertain course of economic recovery ahead.I notice that those opposite find a project of magnitude, the single largest prospective resource project in Australia's history, a matter of amusement. I would draw their attention today also to a statement by Dr Henry, who was the subject of a question just before from the Leader of the Opposition. He said that the government's measures taken to date, both the monetary policy response and fiscal response, have had quite an impact in supporting aggregate demand in Australia. The fact is that, as a result of the early and decisive action of the Australian government, so far Australia has been weathering the global economic recession better than most economies. We have the strongest growth, the second lowest unemployment and the lowest net debt and deficit of all of the world's most advanced economies, and so far we are the only one of them not to have gone into recession.But this means that there is no cause for complacency for the future. That is why the Treasury secretary made his statement today. That is why the government will do all it can to support private sector development projects in the country of the type that I have referred to in WA. The Australian government, the Western Australian government and our major resource companies will be working together to proceed with Australia's economic development in what remains an uncertain period ahead and what will be for the nation and the world a rocky road to recovery.</DOC>

 - Can I draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the statement from the business community here a year or so ago. They said it is time to look at the totality of the Australian tax system. That is going to be an important consideration for the future when it comes to our long-term economic reform. The problem in the past has often been that as we engage in mature debates about the future of the taxation system they get derailed by partisan comment on the way through. Let us look at what options are presented and see what the right course of action is for the future.I say to the honourable gentleman when it comes to his contribution to taxation reform: whatever happened to the Ergas review, commissioned by those opposite as the blueprint for taxation reform for the alternative government of Australia? It seems to have disappeared down the same hole as the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition's leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flynn for his question. In doing so, I indicate that he, like I, understands the importance of the LNG sector to Australia not only from an export point of view but also from a clean energy point of view. Historically, the LNG sector has been confined to the west coast of Australia and a small operation in the Northern Territory. The potential in the foreseeable future is also for a real industry on the east coast of Australia - hence the interest of the member for Flynn in the development of the LNG sector.It is in that context that the Western Australian government has been working closely with the Australian government to secure the Gorgon LNG investment in Australia, a joint venture investment potentially of the order of $50 billion by Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell. As the Prime Minister has said this afternoon, it is potentially the biggest single investment ever made in Australia. Not only is it important from an economic point of view in terms of domestic jobs and investment; it is also potentially a major export earner which creates wealth not only for the private sector in Australia but also for the Australian government.On that note, I am pleased to say that the agreement between the Western Australian government and the Australian government also enables us to put in place the regulatory regime previously approved by this parliament which goes to the injection and storage of CO2, which is consistent with what we want to achieve in offshore waters. In that context, I express my appreciation for the opposition's support in enabling that legislation to have passage through the lower house and the Senate over the last 12 months.The project also represents a major step forward on clean energy. The House will recall that the Prime Minister has been responsible for putting in place the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, which was well represented and welcomed by the meeting of G20 leaders in Italy not long ago. The Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute has received considerable international support, with over 130 founding members and collaborating partners, including 23 national governments and over 100 companies. The reason it has received overwhelming support is the need for us, both domestically and internationally, to make real, practical progress on the clean energy front. Carbon capture and storage is central for Australia's endeavours to move to a low-emissions economy, because of the importance of coal in guaranteeing our energy security.I therefore remind the House that not only does the Gorgon project represent potentially one of the G8's targets of 20 CCS projects to be in place by 2020; it also represents potentially the biggest commercial deployment of carbon capture and storage in the world, consistent with our endeavours and consistent with the endeavours and objectives of the G20, as laid out in their recent meeting in Italy. It is not only important from a clean energy point of view; it is also of vital importance to Australia as we make progress with respect to the challenge of the global financial crisis. I will simply say that, if everything goes well for Australia over the next 12 to 18 months, we could secure something in the order of $100 billion in LNG investments in Australia which create a good platform for job creation and wealth for the broader Australian community and also key revenue opportunities for government to do what is necessary on key fronts such as education, health, child care and transport - all those services that the Australian community expects that we provide.This project represents practical endeavours to put in place jobs for the Australian community, investment revenue and exports. In essence, it is about wealth creation, something that the government often speaks about but that is little heard of on the other side of the House. Not only will the project itself deliver, domestically, something in the order of $300 billion worth of LNG to export markets in the form of export opportunities; it is also important for our energy security in Western Australia. It will deliver 150 terajoules per day of domestic gas into the Western Australian market no later than 2015, increasing competition and easing supply-side issues for the Western Australian community. On the jobs front, it represents about 6,000 jobs for Australians if we secure final investment before Christmas, with construction to start on Barrow Island prior to Christmas - an important stimulus not only for Western Australia but also for Australia at large. Take the Pluto project at the moment. One in four of those construction workers lives on the east coast. The Gorgon project not only represents, potentially, domestic construction jobs but also represents, potentially, major manufacturing opportunities and the capacity to increase Australian content in a major domestic investment.In conclusion, I say that from the Australian community's point of view it is right for the Australian government to work in cooperation with the Western Australian government and the private sector to secure one of the needs for this project going forward: resolving the issue of CO2 liability. It is also important in putting the project in place to have proper regard for the environmental considerations and the nature of Barrow Island. The project represents industrial scale technology of vital importance in taking forward the clean energy debate, and for Australia it is of fundamental importance for wealth creation, jobs and investment. It is a win-win on all fronts.</DOC>

 - I am glad that the member for North Sydney is spending so much time trawling through statements that were made 15 years ago. It is good that he is discovering some hard work habits, which do not, unfortunately, reveal themselves in other contributions that he makes to public debate. The member for North Sydney is the Billy Brownless of Australian politics, all joviality and jokes and buffoonery, but you would not put him in charge of anything. You would not actually put him in charge of anything serious, any responsibility. -  - If we go through the history, most of us in this place have said some things in the past that we may not necessarily stand by now. I remember in fact the member for O'Connor admitting to lying on TV. And in fact the Leader of the Opposition used to be a republican. So, Mr Speaker, whatever the views I expressed as an eager young backbencher 15 years ago on these issues, I stand by the government's position on the matters that the member for North Sydney has put forward. The government is reviewing all aspects of the taxation system in order to present a modernisation of the Australian taxation system to take our economy forward. If this is the best that the opposition can do in its economic assault on the government, we are going to sleep very easy tonight.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. He has taken a keen interest in the issue of renewable energy, and of course we have discussed a good deal of the government policy with him. Together the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the government's renewable energy legislation and the energy efficiency measures that the government has announced represent comprehensive action by the government to tackle the challenge of climate change.The renewable energy legislation of course is the subject of debate in the House today and is intended to help transform the Australian economy to a lower carbon future and to support investment in jobs in the renewable energy sector. The government's target in this respect is to ensure that, by the year 2020, 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply is generated from renewable energy sources. It is an extremely important piece of legislation before the House at the moment. It is projected that the CPRS and the renewable energy legislation combined will generate about $19 billion in investment in renewables - a very significant contribution to the economy and the renewables sector - and will result, on Treasury modelling, by the year 2050, in the renewables sector being no less than 30 times the size that it is today. All of this is complemented by other government measures, including $2.1 billion to support research, development and the deployment of renewable technologies under our Clean Energy InitiativeExternal organisations of course have a keen interest in this matter. Only recently the Climate Institute released a study demonstrating that about $31 billion worth of clean energy projects are already underway or planned in response to the government's climate change policies and, further, that these would generate around 26,000 new jobs, mostly in regional areas. Of course that does not include the employment that is going to be generated by the government's $4 billion energy efficiency programs and the over $2 billion the government has committed to the development of carbon capture and storage technology. The fact of the matter is that, taking all of that into account, this government has done more in 18 months to support the renewables sector than those opposite did in 12 long years. The fact of the matter is that there are now more solar panels going onto Australian rooftops than ever before. A commitment for 80,000 solar rebates has been achieved since we came to office - compared to 10,500 installations in 12 years under the Howard government.The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has statistics demonstrating that in fact renewables went backwards under the Howard government. In 1997 renewables contributed 10.5 per cent, compared to 9.5 per cent 12 years later. No serious attempt was made by those opposite to increase the mandatory renewable energy target, notwithstanding a 2003 review conducted by the Howard government which recommended that the target be lifted above five per cent. It is a welcome development that the opposition says it now supports the government's renewable energy target. That is a welcome development, and of course the shadow environment minister has put forward a number of amendments to the government's legislation - in stark contrast to the approach taken in relation to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation.But it is very important in this place that the sort of posturing that says that the coalition is now starting to 'green up' because it says that it supports changes in the renewable energy target should not be left without comment. We still have contradictions on the record. Less than one month ago Senator Joyce, the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, had this to say:My predisposition is to vote against the RET.Let us not forget that only last week the opposition voted against the most significant measure to bring about reductions in greenhouse gases - it voted against the CPRS in the Senate.The test of the coalition's position on Australia's action against climate change will not just be to support the government's renewable energy legislation in this House and in the Senate; it is going to be to support the CPRS, to develop a policy position and to put forward specific amendments, have discussion with the government and support these important measures. This is about taking strong action on climate change. That is what this government is doing. It is about bringing about reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, about playing a part in the international negotiations, about playing a constructive role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change and about supporting investment in the renewable energy sector. All of that is what this government is doing and it is time that those opposite took responsibility to support those measures comprehensively.</DOC>

 - Can I say that there are two constant thematics to the opposition's contribution to Australian public policy. One is fear and the second is smear, and beyond that they have nothing to contribute to the deliberations of the parliament. The honourable gentleman asked me about tax reform and the future of it, and I will come back to his question in a moment. I just draw his attention to what the then shadow Treasurer had to say about opposition tax policy - this is dated 7 April 2008, almost back in the Palaeolithic period. Dinosaurs have a particular attraction to that period and we have seen a few dinosaurs out on climate change recently. - The then shadow Treasurer, now the Leader of the Opposition, said in April last year:I have asked distinguished economist Henry Ergas to conduct an examination of the many taxes in Australia at various levels _I presume that might have incorporated various fuel taxes as well. Who would know?_ and to report to the Opposition on options for reforming the tax system.Then he went on to say:In undertaking this study, Professor Ergas will consult widely, and host a Conference to advance our understanding of the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for reform of the tax system.I don't see any particular exceptions from that Ergas review, other than this: it has simply disappeared without trace.Can I say to those opposite that, if they seriously engage in the business of tax reform, it is a bit like your engagement on climate change reform and it is a bit like your engagement on industrial relations reform. Put your policies on the table. We do not happen to see that, whether it comes to fiscal strategy or whether it comes to productivity reform. These matters, in terms of the totality of the tax system, will be considered by Henry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fremantle for her question. Can I say to the House that, if we are serious about tackling the challenge of climate change, we have to move on multiple fronts. We have to move on the proper price of carbon - hence the government's proposed legislation on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which those opposite chose to vote against last week. We as a government have also put forward a renewable energy target which will be a quadrupling of the number of gigawatt hours generated in this country through renewable energy sources by 2020.We are also moving, as the Minister for Resources and Energy indicated before, on the question of carbon capture and storage. It is not just the global institute which we have constructed - the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, which was launched conjointly with a number of leaders from around the world in L'Aquila at the G8 Plus summit only last month. It is our domestic initiatives as well in terms of our proposed investment at scale in large-scale carbon capture and storage. Fourthly, we are moving also on energy efficiency - hence the government's agreement with the state and territory governments on a new national energy efficiency strategy. As part of our economic stimulus strategy we are rolling out some $4 billion worth of investment in energy efficiency measures in people's homes. As the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts just indicated before, we are also embarking upon a new set of measures to make it more possible for people to install solar panels on the roof. All these measures are necessary in our combined efforts on climate change.On the question of renewable energy, we are dealing with the particular challenge which has been delivered to us by the fact that so much has not happened on renewable energies in this country for so long. Those opposite finally got around to setting a so-called mandatory renewable energy target of five per cent back in 2001. They then got together a report - led by, I think, then Senator Tambling, from memory - and decided in 2003, in the formal conclusions of that government-chaired report, that this was simply inadequate, that it was not going to give sufficient support to the renewable energy sector and it needed to be increased. The Tambling report, a bit like the Ergas review, fell off the edge of the table - gone, disappeared. It has gone into Davy Jones's locker. Then we come to the eve of the last election, and those opposite say, 'Finally, it's time to do a little bit about renewable energy - we'll have a 15 per cent target.' Of course, we have seen from them no concrete policy since. But what has happened in the real economy since then? - We particularly enjoy the interventions of the member for Flinders. As we know, he comes from a political party which constantly champions the cause of climate change. He has risen as a real leader amidst their ranks; hence the decisive policy they took on carbon pollution reduction last week and hence the decisive actions on boosting the renewable energy target when they had the opportunity to do so in government. In fact, his voice has counted for nothing.Let us look at what companies had to say during the period when those opposite were in office. Look at what Roaring 40s had to say, for example, when they announced in 2006 that they were stopping work at Heemskirk in Tasmania and Waterloo in South Australia because of poor government support and a failure to increase the MRET. In May 2007, they said:Without an increase in the initial [renewable energy] target level, electricity retailers are reluctant to commit to long-term REC deals which are crucial in financing renewable energy targets. Further substantial investment in the renewable energy industry is unlikely without an increase in the target.That is the Roaring 40s company. From Pacific Hydro, in February 2007, there was a similar statement. Furthermore, the Vestas Nacelle company's operations in Tasmania were affected by the absence of sufficient support by the previous government for renewable energy. But this one really gets me: Global Renewables, an Australian company, announced in March 2007 a $5 billion deal to cut greenhouse pollution in the UK because they could not get support for their technology here in Australia. The quote from them at the time is along the lines of:In Australia there is no incentive to invest in our technology compared to cheaper options _ which effectively allow polluting for free. We had to go to a jurisdiction that recognised our contribution to taking greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.The member for Flinders protesteth too much. This is what these companies had to say not about what the previous government said but about what the previous government did or failed to do. That is the record and it is not just in terms of the individual stories of those individual companies; it is what the cumulative effect of that was, as the honourable member indicated in his answer before, of the overall decline in actual renewable energy generation during the period in which they were in office between 1997 and 2007. Hence the course of action we have before us now with the renewable energy target legislation which we have put forward. - I have referred in my answer so far to what did not happen in the last decade or so on renewable energy. That is why the government has introduced its renewable energy target legislation - because we need to make a difference for the economy, for jobs and for the environment. And that is what we are getting on with the business of doing. Modelling produced for the Department of Climate Change in 2009 shows that the implementation of the expanded RET, together with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, if taken together, would lead to around $19 billion in investment in the renewable energy sector in the decade to 2020. Further, a 2009 Climate Institute study refers to the creation of 26,000 new jobs, primarily in regional areas. That is why we are getting on with the business of making sure that the renewable energy sector in this country has a future. That is why we are getting on with the business of ensuring that consumers have access to this scheme in order to provide support for the further installation of solar panels on their roofs. That is why we are getting on with the business of providing appropriate adjustment for businesses on the way through. But it all would have been that much simpler had those opposite instead risen to the challenge of leadership and put through legislation designed to create a proper carbon price, on the one hand through support for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and, on the other, supporting this particular means by which we provide further encouragement for the renewable energy sector - solar, wind and geothermal as well as wave and tidal and other forms of renewable energy. That is the way for the future.Those opposite, in voting against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, have made the business compliance task for the Australian economy much harder than it need otherwise have been. Nonetheless, we have articulated our approach to this and we look forward to receiving what those opposite may have to say by way of amendments. Why have we had to do this? We have had to do this because at the end of last week they voted down the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and we need to provide certainty for the renewable energy business for a scheme which will begin in January next year. Secondly, we also need to guard against the possibility that those opposite will again vote against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme come November, because, if we have seen this absolute explosion in party unity on the part of those opposite in their excitement to get behind the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme this time, what is going to happen next time given that they have no unity on this question at all? Thirdly, when it comes to the future of the renewable energy target regime, we need also to guard against the possibility that we are left in continued limbo into the future because of failed leadership on the part of those opposite.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to put the partisan divide behind us. We need the national interest to prevail on this question of the future of climate change. It is time for us to act in the national interest in this parliament on something as critical for the economy and for climate change as the legislation which is now before the House. As the Leader of the Opposition finds this amusing, he finds it a matter for smirking, he finds it a matter of great general comic performance, I appeal to those opposite: this is not a matter on which the Australian people are prepared to tolerate your continued internal divisions. The challenge for those opposite is not, as the Leader of the Opposition sought to do on the weekend, to proclaim victory for the defeat of the carbon pollution reduction scheme. That is not leadership; that is a substitute for leadership. Real leadership means looking beyond the horizon and doing something for the future of climate change, doing something real for the future of renewable energy, and actually showing leadership with your own ranks so you can bring a united position to this debate and the critical one which now lies ahead in November. Therein lies the future. I suggest that he opposite, the Leader of the Opposition, lies firmly anchored in the past.</DOC>

 - I sense a theme emerging on the part of those opposite. It has been prosecuted with subtlety, it has been prosecuted with finesse, it has been prosecuted with the back handle of an axe. I say to those opposite, when it comes to the future of tax reform: in response to the business community and the 2020 Summit last year, in response to the representations of the Business Council of Australia and many other peak industry groups, the government believes that the right thing to do is to have a root-and-branch review of the tax system. That is why we have commissioned the Secretary to the Treasury to do so. Furthermore, I say to the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney: when it comes to the future of health and hospital reform - I assume he has read the report produced by Commissioner Bennett - one of the recommendations which was put forward by the commission relates to an increase in the Medicare levy. Therefore, I would say to those opposite, before they go into 'ha-ha' mode - 'Here is a possible discussion about a further tax' - that the commission is quite upfront about the fact that there is one possible way of funding a future approach to the reform of dental care and their particular proposal for denticare. I say to those opposite, as they engage in a fear campaign on debt and deficit, a fear campaign on tax, a fear campaign on health and hospitals, a fear campaign on industrial relations, a fear campaign on climate change and a fear campaign on employment, that what the Australian public would like is a mature national discussion about the options which lie before us. - He interjects, 'Put it on the table' - like the Ergas review, the one which was put out there in April 2008 - but my attention has been drawn to a further proposal on tax reform, which was the subject of some discussion a year or two ago between the member for Higgins and the member for Wentworth. It is this thing here, called Taxation reform in Australia: some alternatives and indicative costings. But here is a really interesting interview -  - We are talking about tax options for the country's future. Our approach is clear-cut. We have the Secretary to the Treasury working through these things. Those opposite said last year that the approach was clear-cut; it is just that it has disappeared - that is, the Ergas review. Absent the Ergas review, we are left with the Turnbull proposals of 29 August 2005. In a great interview between Karl Stefanovic, of the Today program, and the then Treasurer about the status of this particular set of tax reforms as proposed by the member for Wentworth -  - The member for Sturt would be fully aware that questions containing health policy and possible taxation sources to fund future reform were canvassed earlier in my answer to the question. I say to the honourable member: Karl Stefanovic asked the then Treasurer about tax policy, and he said:Alright, Malcolm Turnbull came up with a tax plan as you know, as you are fully aware, what did you make of that plan?The Treasurer then said:Well, he didn't actually have a plan_ - The then Treasurer said, 'Well, he' - that is, the member for Wentworth - 'didn't actually have a plan.' Stefanovic said, 'Well, he had a model.' The Treasurer then said, 'He had, in fact, 280 or so.' Then he went on to say: 'I am sure if you didn't like one, there were another 279 that you could take a look at _ The point is when you actually have a tax plan you do you actually have to come up with an alternative.' Well said, Member for Higgins. The member for Higgins also contributed to the debate today, I am advised, in relation to this matter, so there is no -  - The point of the reference to the member for Wentworth's then contribution to Australia's national debate on tax reform and the absent debate since he has become shadow Treasurer, as Ergas did its disappearing act, is that, if we are going to have a mature national conversation about tax reform, we are going to put our ideas out there in due season - that is why we have the Secretary to the Treasury at work - and I would assume that those opposite would do so as well. But, instead, what we had on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme last week was them standing up time and time again saying they could not support the legislation we put forward, because they had an alternative view. When asked what their alternative view was, they could not find one or agree on one. Frankly, the nation deserves better.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. He knows, like everyone on this side of the House, that the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will help create a low-pollution future for Australia. It is certainly the case that Australians want action on climate change. Yes, it is the case that action on climate change will mean that things will have to change. Treasury modelling released earlier this year, and available on the Department of Climate Change website, recognises that the price of pollution will add around 1.2 per cent to the consumer price index over two years. Of this, household food prices could contribute around 0.1 per cent. The government has always been very upfront about this. We have made it very clear, including in legislation that has gone through the House of Representatives, that we will provide low- and middle-income households with compensation. Reports in today's Australian suggesting that there is no compensation for households are wrong. Through a package of cash assistance, tax offsets and other measures the government will help these households maintain their standard of living while moving to a low-pollution future. - I want to say, so at least one person up the back knows what this compensation is going to be made up of, that the government will increase pensions and other income support payments by 2.8 per cent over two years, including upfront indexation, to fully meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. A single pensioner will receive compensation of up to $504 over two years. A pensioner couple combined will receive $760 over two years. - I hear the member for Mackellar commenting, but she can wait until I get to what the opposition's views are. Low-income families will also receive compensation to fully meet the expected overall cost-of-living increase. Family tax benefits will be increased, generally by 2.8 per cent over two years, an increase of up to $175 a child on the maximum rate. The low-income tax offset will increase by $430 over two years. So, in specific terms, a single-income family, on average wages - around $60,000 a year - with two children under 12, will receive $861 over two years in extra assistance. - There is a lot of wowing going on from the member for Mackellar. You might wonder how much wowing went on in the Liberal Party party room when they came up with that report last week. If you have a look at the report they put out last week you will see that low- and middle-income households would be worse off because there would not be any compensation. Whether it is their policy or not of course we do not know -  - Thank you. They certainly don't know. But the report makes it clear in black and white - tell it to the wow factor over there - that household compensation would be removed. That is what is in there. Do we hear any wowing? 
 - No! - Under the Liberals - if it is their policy, which of course we do not know - families under the report that was released last week would be hit with higher costs but with no compensation. So maybe that is where this story has come from. The Liberal Party policy is to deliver no compensation to low- and middle-income households; by contrast the government will make sure that they are protected.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable gentleman may be referring to a report in today's Australian, which I understand is in part - it may not be - derivative from an earlier submission from Woolworths, as I understand it, to the government's public inquiry on the future of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I would also draw the House's attention to a statement which was put out by Woolworths this morning which says:Modelling undertaken last year on the previously proposed scheme did show that food, like all goods, would incur a slight price rise. This price impact would be higher if agriculture was included but agriculture is omitted under the current plan. Woolworths submitted this information to the government in 2008 in order to assist with the compensation planning for lower income households.Woolworths goes on to say:Woolworth believes that the CPRS is necessary to effectively address climate change. Woolworth has already invested millions of dollars in sustainability initiatives that will reduce our energy costs and mitigate the impact of any scheme.I would draw that statement to the honourable member's attention. I would also draw to his attention the fact that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme white paper was upfront about the projected impacts in terms of household costs. You cannot inject a new cost for carbon and pretend that it will not flow through to the general economy. It will. The key question is: how do you then compensate households in their dealing with that? That is why the government, through its regime, has proposed a way in which it compensates low-income earners, how it compensates middle-income earners and how it also assists motorists on the way through. That is a responsible course of action.A responsible course of action is also to clearly outline what your industry assistance packages are in terms of how you seek to transition businesses, particularly emissions-intensive trade-exposed sectors of the economy, the coal sector and other critical sectors of the economy, from a higher carbon environment to a lower carbon environment. That is a responsible, balanced systematic approach to how you bring about this sort of fundamental policy change.Can I suggest to the honourable member, as he represents the National Party, who are in fact the ultimate denizens of climate change denial in this place, together with certain well-known members of the Liberal Party who probably should be in the National Party when it comes to climate change, that what the nation requires of us is to put aside our partisan differences on this and begin to work together on climate change for the future, climate change on a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I note for those opposite that, in the debate which unfolded last week, after they released the Frontier Economics report, which they then disowned, they did not advance a single amendment. I think the Leader of the Opposition asked last week, 'Why is the government not negotiating with us on the CPRS?' I say to those opposite: how is it possible to negotiate if not a single amendment is advanced in the Senate? Not a single amendment. I could say to those opposite that the nation's interests, economic and environmental, require a different posture on the part of those opposite both for this the renewable energy target and for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, because business needs certainty and we need to do our bit to bring down greenhouse gas emissions for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question, and I know that this is a serious issue for him and for his constituencies. The challenge of climate change is all about taking responsibility - about taking responsibility for our contribution to global emissions, about taking responsibility for the impact that climate change will have on our environment for the future. That is exactly the approach that the Rudd government have taken as we rise to the challenge of climate change.This morning I spoke in Brisbane at the opening of the International Conference on Ecology and there the government released the report Australia's biodiversity and climate change: a strategic assessment of the vulnerability of Australia's biodiversity to climate change. This report confirms the climate change risks to our iconic natural areas like Kakadu and the Great Barrier Reef. The House may have seen recently a report commissioned by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation which showed that the likely costs to the Australian economy, if we have increasing climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef, is some $30 billion over the next century. The report released today also shows that Australia has an extremely high proportion of species, our unique biodiversity, that will be at risk from climate change impacts.The Rudd government understands these risks, and that is why we brought forward significant reform in the shape of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to begin the task of bringing down Australia's carbon pollution for the first time. That reform was blocked by the coalition. We brought forward reform with the largest energy efficiency rollout in Australia's history, the Energy Efficient Homes package, helping Aussies reduce their energy bills at home for decades to come. That reform was opposed in its entirety by the opposition. This is the same opposition that, as a coalition, had a last minute conversion to a cap-and-trade scheme before the recent election and then last week voted against the same cap-and-trade system in the Senate. So in some ways we can say that the song of the coalition remains the same, that not much has changed since the last election. In fact, we did hear from Senator Minchin earlier this year some of the lyrics of the song when he launched an extraordinary attack on the ABC -  -  -  - They are encouraging me, Mr Speaker. Don't worry; I haven't finished yet. - He launched an extraordinary attack on the ABC for referring to carbon pollution as pollution. He said:It is a nonsense to describe it as the pollutant. I mean, it is grossly misleading of the public to describe it as a pollutant.Then last week in the speeches in the Senate, there was Senator Minchin again, and he said:CO2 is not by any stretch of the imagination a pollutant.And he went on to say:_ this whole extraordinary scheme _ is based on the as yet unproven assertion that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are the main driver of global warming.Tell that to the climate scientists who are working day and night to alert the world and policy makers to the likely impacts of climate change. Tell that to the research institutions that are producing the work day in and day out to let us, as policy makers, know what the impacts of climate change are likely to be. Tell that to the US government, the Chinese government, the non-government organisations and the scientific communities - all those who recognise that dealing with this risk is one of the most important and urgent tasks we have.There was Senator Bushby, who said:I have no choice but to refuse to believe what I am told is truth and to declare myself a 'sceptic' when it comes to the issue of mankind's impact on the climate.Of course, it is not just in the Senate. It is also in the House of Representatives, where they are going backwards; they are not moving forward. I was so disappointed at the remarks of the member for North Sydney when he was speaking to Karl Stefanovic and said: 'Look, climate change is real, Karl.' I think this was mentioned in the House the other day. 'You know, whether it is made by human beings or not, that is open to dispute.' I thought to myself: 'Who is responsible for these carbon dioxide emissions? Perhaps it is the dinosaurs or perhaps the member for North Sydney.' Then I realised it was. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition held his You Tube policy announcement speech/reflections/views in a certain park and I thought to myself, on the theme of dinosaurs, 'I know which park that is - Jurassic Park!'It is tempting to say that nothing has changed since the last election, but the ugly truth is that the coalition are going backwards on climate change. They are now positioning themselves to the right of the former Prime Minister, John Howard, on climate change. It is hard to believe, but the coalition are now trying to make the former Prime Minister, John Howard, look like Al Gore. The fact is there have been 12 years of climate change scepticism. Scepticism leads to denial. Denial leads to inaction. And inaction imposes costs on the Australian community and on the Australian environment. In this instance our country, a continent that is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, deserves much, much better.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I would respond in the following terms: over the last period of the Howard government, the cost of living surged, growing by three per cent. The proposition being advanced is that there has been a relative increase relative to the period they were in government. Three per cent under the Howard government in its last year in contrast over the last year here, where inflation has eased with prices increasing by 1.5 per cent. Under this government, clothing and footwear inflation is down, transportation fuel prices are lower, recreation inflation is lower, financial insurance service prices are lower and there are a number of other categories where that applies. The premise upon which the honourable gentleman asked his question is not correct.The second point I would make goes back to this great question of interest rates. Do those opposite remember how many interest rate rises in a row there were under the previous government? There were 10 - 10 interest rate rises in a row. Those opposite, through the Leader of the Opposition, come here with the great airbrushing of that fact from their collective memory, as if it never happened.Extraordinary actions have been undertaken by the Reserve Bank to deal with the global economic crisis. These were the subject of extensive remarks by the Reserve Bank governor in his testimony before the House committee on Friday. The Reserve Bank governor's remarks reflect the extraordinary circumstances we, and the rest of the world, found ourselves in with the global financial crisis as it unfolded last year. There were unprecedented actions by central banks across the world to bring down interest rates, unprecedented actions by governments across the world - of the classical right, the centre and the left - to inject fiscal stimulus into their economies in order to bring the global economy and national economies and employment back from the brink. These are the courses of action of responsible governments around the world - responsible governments seeking to deal with the realities with which they are confronted rather than engaging in what I can only describe as a very cheap and inexpensive debate here in terms of real policy credibility, advanced by those opposite to suggest what the honourable member has just suggested in terms of prices. Can I suggest that he, instead, familiarise himself with the facts and base his next question on a set of factual propositions rather than the fancy in which he has just engaged.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question. As members would be aware, the global recession has knocked a giant hole in projected government revenues in the vicinity of $200 billion over a period of four years. As a result, the government has been obliged to undertake a period of borrowing in order to cover the ensuing deficits, because the alternative would be to crunch the economy into the ground, to devastate the Australian economy, to cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs and thousands of businesses to close.In the face of that unprecedented challenge, it is good to see that monetary policy and fiscal policy have been working in tandem to stimulate economic activity, to sustain jobs and to sustain business in the Australian economy in this time of extraordinary challenge. As part of that process, the government is engaging in a modest and responsible borrowing program. It is significant that tonight this has been confirmed by very important players in this process. I would like to quote first the statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Stephens. In evidence to a parliamentary committee on Friday he stated:_ 15 per cent of GDP is a low number by virtually any other standard. So I do not feel that that debt burden, if that is what happens, is going to seriously impair the country's economy.I would like to add to that statements made by the Secretary to the Treasury at a business function earlier today, where he stated:It does seem clear that the measures taken to date, both the monetary policy response and the fiscal policy response, have had quite an impact in supporting aggregate demand.In passing, I add the statement of Standard and Poor's when they were reconfirming Australia's AAA rating. They stated:_ the deficits and associated borrowings do not alter the sound profile of the country's public finances.What you are seeing here is the government standing shoulder to shoulder with the Reserve Bank of Australia and with the Australian Treasury to fight the impact of the global recession and to sustain jobs and business activity under enormous pressure.There are other positions being adopted on the issue of debt and on the issue of the deficits projected. Although the Reserve Bank's assessment of the likely impact of the debt on the Australian economy is not shared by the opposition in their rhetoric - and we have all heard the scare stories about debt, deficit and future generations - when it comes to their specific position on issues it is quite a different story. When it comes to actually presenting any savings measures to ameliorate the impact of future deficits - when it comes to their own promises about what they might do in the future - then it is very different story. We note, for example, that the report that Frontier Economics produced with respect to climate change last week, which the opposition sort of endorsed and sort of did not, if it were applied, would lead to a very substantial blow-out in the budget deficit over time because of increased reliance on the purchase of international permits for carbon emissions in order to support the electricity industry - a very substantial blow-out beyond $1 billion a year by 2020. I note also that they are still engaged in blocking important government savings measures, important budget initiatives such as reform of the private health insurance rebate and reform of government assistance to dental programs, in the Senate while at the same time proclaiming the great virtues of lower deficits and of lower debt.In addition to this I note that we now have some of the would-be leadership contenders in the Liberal Party out there parading their virtues in public. Most significant is the member for Warringah, who put out a book last week, which I applaud - good on him. - He joined the book club. It is a bit belated, but I welcome him to the club! In that book he proposed a specific initiative. I could not find any savings initiatives. I could not find any tough, rigorous decisions that would help to get the budget back into surplus. But what he did propose was that the means test on family tax benefits should be abolished and that people who have children under five should get assistance from the government for that, irrespective of their income. I am a bit conflicted on this proposition because I have a daughter who is three years old and I would be one of the people benefiting from the member for Warringah's proposal. Unfortunately, in my role as Minister for Finance and Deregulation I have a different position, which is that this would be a grotesque waste of taxpayers' money. Hardworking low- and middle-income earners paying the taxes for high-income earners like me to get a free kick is not my idea of good public policy.I am waiting for some more books from some of the other would-be contenders on the Liberal Party benches. I am waiting for them, but they are not yet here. Maybe there will be one from the member for North Sydney, but he would probably struggle to get out of bed to write one; maybe from the member for Curtin, but she would have to find somebody else to do it for her; and possibly from the member for Goldstein, but he would struggle to find a publisher who thought his works were interesting. So I am not quite sure who is going to step up to the plate to assist the member for Warringah, but I do know one thing: there is a day of reckoning coming for the opposition, and the interesting thing is that it is a trap that they themselves set with things called the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook and the Charter of Budget Honesty, which they implemented in government and which are still in place. What that means is that when we get to an election campaign they have to stand up and say just how they are going to produce a lower deficit and a lower debt and make lots of nice election promises at the same time. We will be watching with great interest as that day of reckoning emerges. You can bet your life the rhetoric will dissolve into the sands faster than you can say boo, because that is what it is: just pure rhetoric.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I do know that it is very sincerely put. We have had a number of very good discussions on both of these issues. Could I go to both of them, particularly this issue about the importance of Aboriginal employment in the building of houses, which I know he understands. Like him, the federal government are determined to make sure that, with our historic level of commitment to remote Indigenous housing, we do get very real employment outcomes. So we are insisting on delivering employment as well as making sure that houses are built and refurbished. We are very happy to continue those discussions with the member for Kennedy about the construction that will be happening in the communities in his electorate.On the other issue of the need for secure tenure, the Australian government do agree with him that it is critical that we have secure tenure over the land on which we build. I understand the point of his question, that the Queensland government moved last year, or the year before I think it was, to 99-year leases to enable the building of housing on Aboriginal land. They, like this government, understand how critical it is that we have secure tenure, that we are in fact able to build houses on land where we have security of tenure. Just like we do in any other part of Australia, when we are building public housing normally we require freehold. In the case of Aboriginal land, we are prepared to go to a lease arrangement but we are going to acquire the security of tenure so that we have the capacity to make sure that the standard of housing into the future is high. I will of course follow up the points that the member for Kennedy has raised and will continue to discuss these issues with him, particularly in relation to his constituency.</DOC>

 - For the last year, the Rudd government have been focused on cushioning the blow of the global recession on Australia and of course will continue to do so. We are now starting to get a better picture of how Australia is performing in the midst of the global recession. The Rudd government's policy response has recently been applauded by the IMF in their assessment of the Australian economy. In fact, the IMF commended the Australian government on what they called its:_ timely policy response, which has effectively cushioned the impact of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy.The IMF also stated that they:_ welcomed the targeted temporary fiscal stimulus which is expected to support domestic demand in 2009 and 2010.Last Friday, the Governor of the Reserve Bank took a similar approach. Of the fiscal stimulus by the government, he said:I think any objective observer would say that the size and speed of that response has been one of the important factors supporting private demand over the past nine months.It is clear that a combination of government and private sector activity has meant that Australia has withstood this crisis with some of the lowest unemployment, highest growth and lowest debt levels in the developed world.I am asked about the importance of consistency in economic decision making as we deal with the fallout from the global economic recession. When it comes to consistency, there are some important lessons to learn. For example, on April Fool's Day, the member for Wentworth and the member for North Sydney held a doorstop. The Leader of the Opposition cast judgment on the government's stimulus package and he declared it not to have worked. He said:No jobs created, no enduring economic activity promoted or inspired by it.That was the current Leader of the Opposition. That was their strategy: to cast out and say it has not worked. But then, of course, they had a problem on 3 June, when the Leader of the Opposition received some bad news. The news was that, despite the attempts to undermine the fiscal stimulus packages of the government, the ABS announced that Australia was one of only two OECD nations to grow in the March quarter. Then the Leader of the Opposition changed his tune when it came to opportunism. He conceded:Well _ every dollar a government spends within Australia has some impact on economic activity.That was version 2 of the Leader of the Opposition's narrative. Now, as late as last Friday, we have version 3 from the opposition: the stimulation is working too well and overheating the Australian economy and should be withdrawn and that it is putting upward pressure on interest rates. They have gone from arguing that the stimulus package had no impact to arguing that maybe it had some impact to arguing that it is having too much impact. The Leader of the Opposition really should not be so hard on the government's stimulus package. They actually have a lot in common. The package is targeted and temporary, and so is the Leader of the Opposition.This morning, the opportunism of the opposition has had further light cast on it. This morning we had a new low when it comes to the members opposite. Today, we heard from one of the shadow leaders of the opposition - in fact, the preferred leader of the opposition. Today, we heard from Banquo's ghost: our old friend, the member for Higgins. He spoke to the ABC and he spoke of opportunity. He did not speak about Australia being a land of opportunity. He did not talk about the opportunities for Australia as one of the countries that has withstood the global recession better than any other. He did not talk about opportunities for young Australians. He spoke about political opportunity. The member for Higgins has recently been begged by many members opposite to return to the leadership. This is what the member for Higgins said this morning:Actually, the political times probably suit an opposition because since the election more Australians have lost their jobs. Australians have watched their superannuation go backwards. The value of your average Australian asset - that is, their shares and their houses - has gone down, and it is undeniably the case that since 2007, on average, every Australian has gone backwards, which I would have thought is very fertile ground for an opposition.Indeed, it gets worse. He went on to say:So I say there is an opportunity there and the question is to realise it.Have you ever seen more crass political opportunism from a member of this House than from the alternative leader of the opposition, the member for Higgins? The Australian people are looking for more from a political party than opportunism. They are looking for more than an opposition that say, 'The times will suit us.' They are looking for a political party that provides leadership to get through a crisis and provides decisive action, not political opportunism, which the member for Wentworth and the member for Higgins have made an art form of.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. At Senator Fielding's invitation, I did meet earlier today with a number of young people who came to parliament from Shepparton and Warrnambool, in particular. They were actually sitting at the front of the gallery just over there until an earlier point in question time. I did have a good discussion with them about student financing and about aspirations for young people to go to university and we talked through some of their concerns. The Leader of the Opposition, having had a comparable discussion with them, would be aware of some of their concerns about the student financing package.What we talked through in the meeting I had with them was that current student financing arrangements are flawed, and there was a general consensus about that. They, like me, were concerned by the evidence that there are higher income Australians with students living at home who have qualified for the full rate of student allowance, and the findings of the Bradley review are very, very clear on this. That is a concern, and they shared that concern. I think they shared that concern because, like me and the government, they want to see dollars spent on student financing going to make the best possible difference.Our student financing package has been drawn up with those principles in mind. We believe that money should go to low- and middle-income families. The current means test is too low. It means that many lower- and middle-income families miss out. The received message has therefore been that the only way you can get student allowance is to defer for a year and to seek to qualify as independent. The great vice of that, of course, is that many people who do defer for a year actually do not ever come back into education. And we discussed that at our meeting today. We also discussed at our meeting the new scholarship arrangements, with gaps on scholarships under the current system -  - I am talking precisely to that question and the features of the new arrangement. We talked about how the features of the new arrangement include all students who qualify for youth allowance getting access to a start-up scholarship and a relocation scholarship, where those things are capped now and there are students who miss out. And we talked about the ability under the new arrangements for students to earn more through part-time work when they are at university before student financing gets withdrawn.We had a comprehensive discussion. I was pleased to have it. I will certainly be meeting with other young people to discuss these issues. I maintain my view that there is much misinformation and misrepresentation about the package. We want to keep talking it through with people. I was very pleased to meet with the young people today. It was in fact a great discussion. I conclude by suggesting that, in the course of the discussion today, I met a young woman who in her future I suspect may well be the next Laurie Oakes. She was very good at the questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. As a South Australian, I thank him for his interest in the fact that a fellow South Australian, namely my father, celebrated his 80th birthday on Saturday. Happy birthday, Dad. But I have actually been asked about performance pay and better quality in teaching. On the weekend, as well as celebrating my father's birthday, I did release a report, commissioned by the former government, called Rewarding quality teaching. Like all things associated with education and the Liberal Party, this is testament once again to a track record of failure.As a result of the question from the Leader of the Opposition, we have just had the opportunity to talk about their failure in student financing and their inability to get dollars to students who needed it the most - a situation which, of course, led to rural and regional participation rates at university declining under a government that included the National Party. This report is another testament to the failure of the Liberal Party on education. Commissioned by the previous government, the report about performance pay for teachers found no support amongst stakeholders for the previous Liberal government's suggestion that teacher pay and student scores should be put together - one of the dumbest ideas ever floated in Australian politics, which would have been a recipe from the Liberal Party to make sure that every teacher in the most well-to-do schools in this country got a pay rise while every teacher in the most disadvantaged schools in this country got a pay cut.When it comes to talking about education, what we know about the Liberal Party is that in government they used to talk and do nothing; in opposition, they do not bother to talk about education and they do not do anything. In government, they used to float ideas and not follow through; in opposition, they do not even bother floating ideas. We know that a former minister for education, David Kemp, said in 1996:The Federal Government will this month begin a national review of the university education of teachers _ It will recommend new national standards and guidelines for pre-service teacher degrees by April, 1997.You guessed it, Mr Speaker - nothing happened. The last minister for education under the Liberal government, the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, said in February 2007:We need a teacher training and registration process that is nationally consistent, not only for the benefit of the current teaching workforce, but also to make it easier for potential teachers to enter the profession _You guessed it - nothing happened. They were all talk in government and no action, with nothing that made a real difference to the circumstances of Australian children.That stands in stark contrast to the actions of the Rudd government to improve teacher quality. We have entered a $550 million national partnership to do just that. It is already bringing changes to our education system. In New South Wales the funding is being used to create a new category of highly accomplished teachers who will earn around $100,000 a year if they go and teach in the most disadvantaged schools in New South Wales. This is a reform long dreamed of being delivered by the Rudd Labor government. Having pressed this reform through our national partnership and seeing it being delivered in New South Wales, we will be pressing this reform around the nation, because great teachers deserve better pay and kids that need the most benefit from education deserve to have great teachers.We are also funding the Teach for Australia project - an initiative that will bring high-performing graduates into the most disadvantaged schools. Once again, this is a long-dreamed-of and long-talked-about initiative that would bring highly capable young people into disadvantaged schools to share their passion for teaching and their passion for change to see disadvantaged students succeed. This is an initiative on which we have taken action, and it will deliver.In government, we are delivering an education revolution. We are doing it because we need to overcome the track record of neglect of the Liberal government. We are doing it because we want every Australian child to get a great, quality education. What do we see from the Liberal Party? Absolutely nothing. The shadow minister has published one speech on his website this year. That is it. He has nothing more to say about education - no ideas, no debate and no consideration about the nation's future.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for her question. I say to her, and indeed the entire House, that this government is absolutely unapologetic about being committed to accessible, affordable and quality early childhood education and child care. We have shown that in action time and time again. We showed that when we committed over $16 billion for the next four years to this area, which I might add is over $1 billion more than those opposite managed to do when they were in government. We also showed it when we increased the Child Care Rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, providing a much needed added assistance to thousands of Australian families. And we are showing it because we are dedicated to pursuing a quality reform agenda.We know that it is really important to Australian parents that they are assured of the standard of care that their children are getting when they drop them off. We also know, from the recent Child care choices report, which the shadow minister has referred to numerous times, that most parents using child care said that one of their top priorities was quality reform, particularly staff-to-child ratios. When we are pursuing quality reform, that is about looking at staff-to-child ratios. It is also about looking at the qualifications of staff members and aiding parents with a quality rating system so that they can make the right decisions for their own families.We have been absolutely upfront about the fact that there are cost implications in these decisions. In fact, we have been so upfront about this that we engaged in a public consultation process where we put out four different costed options so that the community, parents and stakeholders in the childcare community could come and talk to us. In what is a little bit embarrassing for the shadow minister, when we first came out and did this, her criticism was that we were overconsulting and that we should not get out there and talk to parents. Yet it is interesting to note that when she was asked on the doors this morning, 'What is your alternative? What would the opposition be doing?' her response was, 'We would go out and consult. We would go out and talk to parents about what it is they want.'We have spoken to almost 2,000 people around the country as part of our public consultation. We have had over 800 people undertake online surveys about the proposed changes. - It is important to consider that any cost implications would be offset by the government's 50 per cent Child Care Rebate, which means that the government would effectively foot the bill for half of any increases.I think it is also important to clarify here that reports in the media today, which include a cost of $125 per child, are an inaccurate reflection of the consultation costs which the government has put out. It is also important to say that no final decisions have been made on this, because we have committed to making these decisions in partnership with the Australian community, which is what we continue to do. While those opposite can flip-flop about whether they want to consult or whether they do not want to consult, on this side of the House we are committed to getting on with the job of supplying quality, affordable, accessible child care to the some 800,000 Australian families who use it.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I know that you will have a particular interest in the answer to this question, the government having announced an extra three superclinics to be added to the program - one in your electorate and one in the member for Wannon's electorate. I did think for a moment that, when the member for Indi was coming to the dispatch box to ask her question, it was perhaps about the superclinic that is to be in her electorate, announced by the Prime Minister and I on Friday, but unfortunately not. It falls to the member for Page, who I know has been taking a close interest in the rollout of her superclinic in Grafton. It was a very heavily attended consultation process. Last month the government announced that a successful bid had been selected and a contract signed. An integrated multidisciplinary model of care will be delivered, tailored to the needs of the local community.We are very proud that, of the 31 superclinics announced at the election, 24 contracts have been signed, construction at eight sites is underway and nearly 7,000 in the member for Solomon's seat have used services since December last year when the after hours interim services were started. I know the member for Ballarat is pleased that the superclinic at Ballan is due to be opened this month and the first patients will be able to use the facility in September. Interim services have also commenced in the Blue Mountains where, I know the member for Macquarie will be pleased to hear, an additional GP has been employed. In Devonport, the member for Braddon will be pleased to hear that there has been a commencement of asthma and diabetes clinics to be linked to the services. I understand as well that in southern Lake Macquarie the physiotherapy and rehabilitation centre, including a hydrotherapy pool, has already commenced services and is due to be officially opened shortly.Of course, the  report of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission made it very clear that this strategy is taking the right direction for reform. In fact, the commission takes this even further and suggests that we should invest more in primary healthcare centres across the country, making use of multidisciplinary care - the sort of arrangement that the government flagged at the election and is now delivering. The commission identified that a strong primary healthcare sector is an important way of keeping people in the community healthy and out of hospital. In the Prime Minister's and my travels, talking at hospitals around the country, consulting on the report of the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, we were recently in Adelaide. On the same visit we signed three funding agreements for three GP superclinics in Adelaide: one at Noarlunga in Kingston, one at Modbury in Makin and one at Playford North in Wakefield. This means that South Australia will have an investment of $57.5 million in primary health care, delivering better services to South Australians. Interestingly, a fact that I think captured the imagination of all of those who were at this announcement was a report from the South Australian Minister for Health, Mr John Hill, who indicated that when a similar service had opened in Aldinga, in the seat of the member for Kingston, presentations at the Noarlunga Hospital emergency department were reduced from those surrounding suburbs by around 16 per cent.So those opposite can continue to be dismissive of these investments, but in fact these investments are aimed at delivering better services to the community and at the same time diverting unnecessary presentations from our emergency departments. The MP in this House who has taken the least interest in a superclinic being built in his electorate is the member for Dickson, who did not turn up to the start of construction of the Strathpine superclinic last month, and I am sorry to say that this has been pretty typical of his performance to date. It may be that he already knew that he was going to cut and run from his seat at that time and did not think he would bother to stand up for delivering health services to his electorate. Not only does he not seem to want the $2.5 million investment in his electorate but there are 90 construction jobs in Dickson that do not seem to rate as important to the member for Dickson.So I would urge others in this House to take the approach of others opposite, perhaps the member for Cowan, who like the Liberal Minister for Health in Western Australia has welcomed this investment, or perhaps the approach of the member for Wannon, who lobbied for the investment that is now being made in his electorate, or perhaps even the member for Parkes, who is still pushing for his. We know that that request is there. These members understand that these investments provide not only jobs today but long-term health services for the future that take pressure off our hospitals. And the member for Dickson should get on board.</DOC>

 - Here we go - another desperate smear-and-fear campaign from those opposite. I am happy to answer it, but be under no doubt what this is all about: those opposite are so embarrassed that they voted against a successful stimulus that here we go with another fear campaign. - What we have through the Henry review is another fear campaign from those opposite, because they are so bereft of any policy all they can do is run a fear campaign. As the Prime Minister said in this House yesterday, we take the issue of tax reform very seriously, and that is why we established the Henry review. We do want to simplify the tax system. We do want to put more incentive in the tax system. We do want to make our tax system internationally competitive. There was some publicity on the weekend: an article on the front page of a paper, which suggested there had been some discussion with the government about capital gains tax or taxes on housing. There will be plenty of this drivel and misrepresentation around as we go through the Henry review, because those opposite will stop at nothing to mount a fear campaign to camouflage the fact that they do not have an alternative fiscal policy - no alternative fiscal policy whatsoever. But insofar as those press reports on Saturday said there would be any complication with the government -  -  - I will be very clear with the Leader of the Opposition: there have been no discussions with the government about those matters that appeared on the front page of the Australian on Saturday. -  - Any suggestion that the government was aware of the matters mentioned on the front page of the Australian on Saturday is fiction. Any suggestion that the head of the Henry review, Dr Henry, had any knowledge of those matters he himself has said is fiction. So what we have here is another fear campaign from a group of people who basically could not support this country in its hour of need. When it needed an economic stimulus they got up and said that it would not work. They said the stimulus would not work. The Leader of the Opposition went to the National Press Club of Australia one week before the budget and said the stimulus would not support one job. The data is in and, of course, when it comes to the economy what this proves is that those opposite -  - What those opposite have proven time and time again is that, whether it is with economic stimulus or whether it is with the bank guarantee, they are the masters of misjudgment. The ultimate evidence of that is that there is not one skerrick of a fiscal policy they can put forward in this House. The facts of the matter are these. The stimulus has worked, but there are big challenges ahead for this nation. What the nation requires is unity in this House in dealing with those challenges, not the bitter division that we have seen from those opposite, not the fear-and-smear campaigns, not what they did in this House some weeks ago, where for a whole week of the parliament they could not ask me one single question about the economy. Indeed, in something like eight question times there has not been a question to the Treasurer about the economy. I have concluded. - </DOC>

 - I take the interjection - I think from the Leader of the National Party - about a presentation last night to the Australian Industry Group about our recovery strategy for the Australian economy: what we have invested, the results which have been produced so far from that and the journey we still have to undertake as a nation, given the impact of the global economic recession.Those opposite, I think I could say, appear to be a little agitated today in the House. David Speers's Twitter this morning - I am a bit of a fan of Twitter - says:Another messy Coalition partyroom. Much debate over tactics on Renewable Energy Target. Nats angry at Hunt flagging Coalition support.It is always good to see the coalition hard at work at tearing themselves apart. Perhaps that explains the level of agitation we see on behalf of those opposite. Where is Greg Hunt? Has he disappeared? I hope Barnaby has not taken him outside! -  - I return to the question that I have just been asked concerning the government's response to the global economic crisis. I draw the House's attention to today's small business survey, which shows some positive news in response to actions taken by the government but also to critical actions taken by small businesses themselves in what has been a very trying time for them. According to the latest ACCI Small Business Survey, small business conditions improved over the June quarter. -  - Lazarus has returned from the embrace of the National Party! He is very pleased about receiving attention, because he gets no opportunity to ask a question in this place, such is the depth of unity on their side of the chamber on all matters of policy.When it comes to the ACCI Small Business Survey, what we have, of course, is a reflection of the fact that small business conditions improved over the June quarter, rising three points to 39.8. This is the highest level since November 2008. Further, looking ahead, small business expectations for conditions over the next 12 months have increased, with the index rising from 30.2 per cent to 36.9 per cent. Furthermore, it is quite plain from the survey that there are still many challenges lying ahead, and we should be frank and upfront about the fact that there is still a rocky road to go for small business. That is why the government continues to be in close consultation with that sector through the small business minister.Questions have been asked in this place about the impact of the government's nation building for recovery plan. I draw the attention of those opposite and the House in general to the impact of our cash payments, at the end of last year and early this year, through to retail; 1.5 million Australians work in retail and, critically, the overwhelming concentration of Australian small business is in retail, and that, of course, has been of direct consequence for them. In fact, I seem to recall there may have been some reflections at the doors on that this morning from members opposite, but I am sure that will be taken up later in question time today.Tradies have also benefited from the investment we have made in the nation building for recovery plan in schools, in public housing and, of course, in our energy insulation program as well. On top of that, most critically, I draw the House's attention to the $3.7 billion small business and general business tax break. This temporary investment allowance has enabled many small businesses to reach forward and to invest in those items of capital equipment they may need to expand their business. This, I believe, has been an important measure which has received a positive response from the sector.Putting all these things together, what we see is that Australia's overall economic performance is better than that of most of the other economies around the world, notwithstanding the impact of the global economic recession. Putting these measures together, as of the end of the first quarter we were generating the fastest economic growth in the OECD. Of the major advanced economies, we had the second lowest unemployment rate, the lowest net debt and the lowest deficit of the major advanced economies and were the only one among them not to have gone, so far, into a technical recession.Why this is important for the House is that it goes to the question of the policy divide which exists within this place on the future direction of economic policy. It also goes to the absolutely wrong and flawed judgement we have had from the Leader of the Opposition on so many questions of policy, including economic policy, in the period that he has occupied that position. It was the Leader of the Opposition who told the House and the country at large that the bank guarantees that we provided as a government last October represented a policy failure. He said that the policy that was announced on 12 October was a failure.I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to what would have happened were it not for the introduction of those guarantees for deposits and the guarantees for interbank lending, wholesale funding needs for our banking system. And he still maintains this is a policy failure, based on his interjections. On 22 October he said that the policy that was announced on 12 October, which was the policy containing the double guarantee on both elements of our banking system, was a failure. I submit to the House that this represents catastrophically flawed judgement. What would the country have done had he been in the cabinet room on that occasion, responsible for these decisions?What we have seen is wrong judgement on this. Imagine what would have happened to our deposit holders across the country if they had had no confidence in the banking system on that following Monday, the Monday following what was Black Friday on the stock markets of the world. Secondly, can I also say to those opposite: what would have happened, given that interbank lending had ground to virtually zero in the last months of last year, had we not provided that guarantee for interbank lending? It would have tunnelled straight back into the arteries of capital - that is, the arteries of business - namely, the small business sector as well as the business community more generally.But that is just one illustration of wrong judgment. A second illustration of wrong judgment goes to the complete and systematic attack which those opposite have launched upon the government's economic stimulus strategy. Time and time again they have stood up, in this place and outside this place, saying that it would have no effect whatsoever and was a complete waste.In fact, we had the Leader of the Opposition saying in March this year that the 'cash splash', to use his term, had 'had no discernible impact on our economy'. 'It hasn't created a job. It hasn't stopped us from going backwards in terms of economic growth.' This is just, again, wrong judgment. Having been confronted - as we were as a government - with the great challenges facing our economy in October last year, and the decisions which needed to be taken in order to put a floor under economic growth, this government took the right decision, based on Treasury advice, to provide support to the economy, to step into the breach which was left by a private sector in retreat. Those opposite argue that we should never have done so - that we should have simply sat on our hands and allowed the economy to crash through the floor, as we saw occur in so many other economies around the world.The contrast between the government and the opposition on these two most critical areas of policy in response to the global economic recession, (1) the provision of guarantees to the banking system and (2) the injection of our national economic stimulus strategy, both fundamentally opposed by those opposite, both fundamentally supported by the government and implemented by the government, underscores the flawed judgment which was reflected in so much of the policy contribution by the Leader of the Opposition - flawed judgment on this and on so many matters.The government intends to get on with the business of long-term reform for the Australian economy and, as the Treasurer was saying in his response to the question just posed before, that will include the long-term reform of our taxation system as well, and that is the right thing to do; the long-term reform of our health and hospital system; the long-term reform of our education system; the long-term reform of our industrial relations system - as we have had entrenched through the legislation put into the parliament by the Deputy Prime Minister.In the prosecution of the tax debate, we will have rolling discussions with the Treasury about what should be done and should not be done. That is the right way to proceed. It is called a rational policy debate. That is what we on this side of the House are engaged in. We do not apologise for one element of it. And can I say to those opposite, returning to David Speers' observation in Twitter: why don't you try and get your own act together on just one element of policy and join with us in the constructive business of the nation, and not simply pull apart yourselves and, as a consequence, the country.</DOC>

 - As I said earlier -  -  - The government has no intention of pre-empting any of the considerations of the Henry review - none whatsoever. If those opposite want to conduct a fear campaign like they have been conducting on the stimulus, like they have been conducting on the bank guarantee, nobody is going to believe them.This is a comprehensive review being conducted by Dr Henry, right across personal income tax, right across company tax, right across federal-state relations, and it will encompass the full ambit of the tax system. Dr Henry is conducting that review independently, through the Treasury. That is how it should be, and that is what is happening. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question, because Australia is performing well at the moment in what is a very difficult global environment, and it is certainly very clear that our stimulus is having a significant beneficial effect on the economy. You can see it in terms of retail sales, up 5.2 per cent since November last year. You can see it in the forward indicators in the housing market. You can see it in the consumer confidence figures, up 27.8 per cent in the last three months alone and the highest since the series began in 1975. But of course you can also still see the weakness in the global economy, and, as Governor Stevens said last week:The global economy could suffer another setback of some kind. We think the likelihood of that has declined, but the possibility nonetheless remains.We had the statement from the Treasury secretary yesterday where he made the point that the rest of the world is not out of the woods and it is possible that there will be a second shockwave.These are timely reminders that global economic conditions remain volatile, and it is not easy to predict the path to recovery. Of course, that is why the government's stimulus has been so instrumental in providing support to our economy at a time of global weakness. The governor and others have supported that proposition. The governor had this to say last week:_ fiscal measures have supported demand _Dr Henry has made the point that it is reasonable to conclude the cash payments did succeed in supporting the economy. But, of course, the challenges do remain. The challenges remain in terms of the reduction in the terms of trade. The challenges remain in terms of a reduction in business investment. And all of this points to the importance of our economic stimulus and, most particularly points to phase 2 and phase 3, and their importance over the next year and the year after that.But, of course, just about everybody in Australia knows that the economic stimulus is working, everybody knows the job is not finished and everybody knows there are still challenges ahead - that is, of course, except those who sit opposite. Everybody else can get on and work with the government on the very big task of supporting employment, the very big task of supporting small business and the very big task of supporting employment in those small businesses - something that is not understood by those opposite, because what we have had is just another monumental misjudgment from this Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer in opposing the stimulus. They have turned that misjudgment into an art form. So people are entitled to question their motives when they have been so spectacularly wrong about what has been going on in our economy. Given that history, nobody will believe their desperate fear campaigns.</DOC>

 - I said in my first answer that we categorically deny the proposition about capital gains put on the front page of the Australian last Saturday. Why did we do that? We did that because the story asserted there had been consultation with my office. Untrue. We did it because the story asserted that there had been modelling. Untrue. All of those things were untrue. But the Henry inquiry is independent. It is looking at all aspects of the tax system. It is doing that independently of the government. We do not intend to respond to a daily diet of misinformation from those opposite or anywhere else. The Henry inquiry will get on with doing its work and the government will receive its report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. I commend her also for her work with small businesses in her electorate, which I was fortunate to meet with her recently. In late 2008 and early this year the government put in place two stimulus packages involving some immediate spending on cash payments; some medium-term investment in infrastructure, such as building new school buildings across Australia; and substantial longer term investment in infrastructure in areas like road, rail and ports. This strategy was necessary because we were seeing unfold before our eyes a collapse in global economic activity across the world that was already starting to reverberate through the Australian economy, threatening hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs and thousands of Australian businesses.It is now 10 months or so since that first package was put in place and it is clear that that stimulus strategy is working and is going to continue to work. You can see that through the statistics with respect to retail spending, particularly when compared with like countries; you can see it in business investment data; you can see it in employment data; and you can see it in recent confidence levels, both business confidence and consumer confidence. It is very clear that Australia is in much better shape than comparable countries and it is in much better shape than it would have been had the government not acted very quickly to put stimulus into the economy to sustain economic activity and to sustain jobs.Having said that, the road ahead is still very challenging and the risks that are there in the international economy are many and varied. But it remains absolutely clear that had the government not taken that decision to stimulate economic activity we would now be in a position with much, much higher unemployment and a large number of business failures.I would like to draw the House's attention to the statement by the Reserve Bank governor on Friday, when he said:_ I think an objective observer would say that the size and speed of that response has been one of the important factors in supporting private demand over the past nine months.Yesterday the Secretary to the Treasury said very much the same thing.Of course, we know that the Liberal and National opposition opposed the government's stimulus strategy. They initially said it would have no impact. Then they changed gear and said: 'Well, it will have a little bit of an impact. That's because there's just so much money. It is unavoidable that it will have some impact.' Now they have got to the point of saying it is having too much impact and that it needs to be wound back because otherwise you will overheat the economy and put upward pressure on interest rates. In each case one thing stands out about their approach to this issue, and that is that their analysis is not driven by objectivity, not driven by any desire to understand the problems or the challenges of the Australian economy but driven by a desire to make short-term political points, driven by an intention to snipe at the government and to find fault with the government irrespective of the merits of the issue.I have a simple message for the Leader of the Opposition, and that is that, although the Australian people understand that the political process involves a bit of heat and light, a bit of argy-bargy, a bit of colour and a bit of rhetoric, ultimately underneath all that they look for judgment in their leaders. And the one thing that the Leader of the Opposition has consistently shown in this debate is his lack of experience, his impetuousness and his lack of judgment. The Australian people want judgment in their government, and that is what the Australian government has shown, under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, to deliver the stimulus packages to sustain employment and business in our economy.</DOC>

 - We just got the O'Farrell strategy from 'Sloppy Joe'. He is not actually running in the federal parliament; he is running in the state parliament. You are going to have to do a lot better than that, Joe. - I withdraw. As the Prime Minister and I have indicated today, this is a comprehensive review. The Henry review is having a look, root and branch, at all of the issues in the taxation system except two - the GST and tax-free super were ruled out. This is because it is a comprehensive review. No fear campaign from those opposite is going to lessen the determination of the government to receive that report, which is being conducted independently via a panel. We will examine it and we will take forward policy proposals in the interest of this nation. That is what we will do.As you have demonstrated with the bank guarantee and the economic stimulus, you are absolutely incapable of coming to grips with the fundamental economic challenges this country faces in the short term, the medium term and the long term. You have demonstrated it on climate change; you demonstrated it when it came to economic stimulus. You do not understand the stability of the financial system and you are incapable of dealing with contemporary challenges. - I am asked about tax reform. The government has a comprehensive process in train, one that is supported broadly by the Australian community. But of course there was a time when the Leader of the Opposition was the shadow Treasurer. He had an alternative tax plan. The problem is that he has hidden it in the bottom drawer. I well recall when he commissioned Mr Ergas to review the taxation system. Indeed, I think the member for Higgins will well remember some years before when the Leader of the Opposition put forward 289 different proposals for tax reform. But this report from Professor Ergas has not been released. Why has it not been released? That is because there is a secret plan in this House. It is the opposition leader's secret plan that he will not tell the Australian people about: he has a flat tax plan for the income taxation system which will mean massive tax cuts for the top end and massive tax increases for everybody else. We will have no more of this hypocrisy from those opposite, because they are absolutely incapable of putting forward an alternative plan for this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. I know he is a great supporter of his local schools. I have a great story to tell him about Queensland because we have received notification that the first Primary Schools for the 21st Century project has been completed. It has been completed at Yandina State School in Queensland. Yesterday the kids there started to use their new library, their new ICT centre and their refurbished classrooms, and they are already using the covered outdoor learning area.Just to give you an indication of these facilities, I will show you a photograph of a new building constructed at Yandina State School as a result of the Building the Education Revolution program. This photograph is of the covered outdoor learning area, complete with drinking taps - part of the Building the Education Revolution program. -  - Finally, I have been supplied with a photo of how the new library looks. It seems to me that it would be a very odd world in which it was out of order to celebrate the construction of a new library for children in a school in Queensland.Of course, this school is in the member for Fairfax's electorate. Because of the poor judgment of the Leader of the Opposition, the member is now in a position where he has to go to Yandina State School and explain to them why he opposed this rebuilding and refurbishment of their school. It was poor judgment. But of course it is worse for the member for Fairfax than that. Because of the poor judgment of the Leader of the Opposition, he also has to go to his local community and try to explain the Leader of the Opposition's claim that this stimulus package has not created one job.Well, how is he going to explain that to the local tradies who worked on this school project? How is he going to explain it to R&amp;R Earthmoving from Mooloolah; to Perren and Penny Plumbing, and G. James Glass and Aluminium from Kunda Park; to Literok Painting from Peregian Beach; to Epsilon Gulf Carpentry from Bli Bli; to Spence Doors and Joinery from Forest Glen; and, last but by no means least, to Rosemount Roofing, Harpers Electrical and Data, and Master Kelwin Floors from Nambour? All of them worked on this project. How is he going to explain to them the opposition's claim and, particularly, the poor judgment of the Leader of the Opposition in saying that this did not support one local job?The good news is not just in that school in Queensland; it is throughout the country. Where this parliament sits and meets today, I am happy to be able to advise the parliament that the ACT government expects the first round of the National School Pride Program and the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program to support 250 on-site jobs for people in Canberra, including around 50 apprentices - that is a rate of 20 per cent being apprentices, and that is just fantastic. It is supporting local jobs. People out in schools and people in building and construction know how valuable this program is. That is why Ron Mitchell from Trend Windows and Doors in the ACT wrote to me and said:Not only am I now more secure in my job but so too are my fellow employees, my subcontractors and even the people who work for my suppliers, right down to the blokes down the road I buy screws from.So those are the words of a local tradesperson. In the words of the Executive Director of Master Builders Association, Rob Stewart:The timing has been brilliant for the industry because I think if we hadn't had this the commercial side of the industry would have been sliding into a downturn. It has given the industry a real lifeline, probably for the next 2½ years.So, whilst the opposition guffaws, squeals and exercises poor judgment, this government is getting on with the job of building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow while supporting jobs today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. In December last year, as part of the economic stimulus plan, we injected some $1.2 billion into the Australian Rail Track Corporation. That was to undertake some 17 rail projects right across the country, and they got underway very swiftly indeed - putting people to work, particularly in regional Australia. Two weeks ago I was in Seymour and I laid the last sleeper on the track upgrade between Albury and Seymour. -  - I was well supervised! Funding announced last December, 225,000 concrete sleepers placed and 120 people employed in regional Victoria, as well as people employed in Wagga Wagga making the concrete sleepers - this was a $45 million project to not only create jobs today but also make the railway more efficient and increase productivity for the long term. The modernisation of our freight rail network will position us to come out of the global economic recession just that much stronger. The Leader of the Opposition said some five months ago that the stimulus:_ is not producing jobs, it's not protecting jobs, and it certainly isn't creating jobs.He said that the Prime Minister:_ hasn't been able to demonstrate that it's created one job _Well, I met the 120 workers who worked on that site at Seymour - who had been given employment and training, who had been given opportunities and who then were going on to other activity with the ARTC on that day. I wonder what they think about the Leader of the Opposition's comments. Three months ago, when the Treasurer and I were in South Australia in the electorate of Kingston looking at the new railway line extension there from Willunga to Seaford, the Leader of the Opposition was in Adelaide too, questioning again our stimulus projects. He said there:_ everything will have to be reviewed. There's no question about that.He was questioning the economic stimulus package of this government. For months we have had the argument that the stimulus was not creating jobs and that it was too large. So I was interested this morning when in his doorstop interview the Leader of the Opposition said, when it comes to infrastructure:_ when you look at it closely you see that the Rudd government is committed to spending really no more than the Coalition was committed to spending.So we are spending too much, the economic stimulus plan should be wound back and yet we are not spending any more than they were going to spend. The fact is that we are investing more in rail in 12 months than those opposite did in 12 years. The Leader of the Opposition simply cannot make up his mind. Is the stimulus too large? Should it be wound back? Or is it there at all? We do not know - depending upon the comments of the opposition. What is very clear is that the Leader of the Opposition has no judgment when it comes to politics, has no judgment when it comes to policy and, most importantly, has no judgment when it comes to people.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Canberra for her question. In fact, just this morning the member for Canberra and I visited the first house to be built under the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan's social housing component in her electorate - the first house in the ACT, in the member's own electorate. It is a four-bedroom house, a class C adaptable dwelling, a six-star energy rated new home for a family.I met Joanna, the lovely woman who is going to move into this new home with her three children, Brandon, Madeline and 15-month-old Ava, as did the member for Canberra. Little Ava is blind and she will need a wheelchair as she grows up, and Joanna and her family have been living in a two-storey terrace style house that will be completely unsuitable for Ava as she grows up. She needs to be carried up and down stairs with the equipment that she is connected to 20 hours out of every 24 hours of the day. She has to be lifted in and out of the bath. That is okay while she is 15 months old, but it will not be okay as she grows up. This house has been purpose built for someone in a wheelchair and will make little Ava's life, her mother Joanna's life and the life of their family just so much easier.I also met the staff of Vogue Constructions, who built this home. This is one of seven homes that they have won through stage 1 of the social housing building program. Stuart Sampson and Nathan Toscan, the directors of Vogue Constructions, told me about the extra people they had put on. Stuart told me that they had employed one extra full-time and one extra part-time employee since they won this work for the seven extra properties, and Nathan estimated that over 60 people had worked on this property over the course of its construction.I also wanted to tell the House about the repairs and maintenance program, a component of this package that has been so extraordinarily successful. When this program is complete we will have done work on more than 60,000 homes right around Australia, and 30,000 of those homes have already been completed. Another 14,000 homes have benefited by work done in common areas. Perhaps most importantly, over 10,000 properties will have substantial upgrades and major work done on them. These are properties that have been sitting vacant or would have become uninhabitable over the next couple of years if major work had not been done on them. We had a target of returning 2½ thousand properties to active use. In fact, we will exceed that target fourfold. We will return more than 10,000 properties to active use that would have been lost from public housing stock had we not done this work. This means many more homes for disadvantaged Australians, a greater contribution to meeting our homelessness targets and a great deal more work for tradespeople across the country.Mr Speaker, I will just give you a couple of examples of these homes that I visited. In April I went to see some terrace homes in Gertrude Street in Fitzroy. They are old terrace houses. They had been old-style rooming houses with little individual rooms, very run-down and very unsafe. No-one stayed there for long - in fact, no-one lived there if they could help it - because of the very poor condition of this housing. I went there to see these terrace houses converted to 19 self-contained little units. They are close to jobs, they are close to transport, they are close to a hospital for people who need ongoing medical care and, best of all, they have great security. So people will stay there. They will build up a community. As a direct result of the stimulus program, we will be able to use that housing, which had been closed down. It was so badly run-down it had to be closed. That will be returned to active use. Yarra Community Housing will run it.An opposition member - Boring! - 'Boring.' That is boring, is it? Housing homeless Australians is boring - that tells us everything we needed to know. Housing homeless Australians is 'boring'. Housing Joanna and her family and providing work for these builders is 'boring'. That tells you a lot, doesn't it? I will tell this side of the House, because they are interested in housing homeless Australians, that Yarra Community Housing, which will run these properties in north Fitzroy, thought they would have to sell properties in other parts of Melbourne to upgrade these properties. Instead, with $17½ million of our stimulus money, they will be able to keep all of their properties in Melbourne and they will be able to house more homeless Melburnians.The member for Wakefield and I visited a 50-year-old home in Elizabeth Grove. That was going to be sold. Instead, it will be upgraded and returned to public housing stock. In Glebe, New South Wales, in April I visited a four-bedroom home sitting there empty, impossible to live in. Now it has a family with four kids living in it. Is that pretty boring, is it - a family with four kids living in a home? I have seen these homes right around Australia - old houses, old blocks of units, run-down, starved of repairs, being prepared for sale because there was no money to fix them, instead getting the major upgrades they need so they can be used for social housing. With the help of the states and territories and the great work of builders and tradies right around Australia, we are returning these homes so they can be used by needy Australians.</DOC>

 - The opposition are so desperate that they are asking yesterday's question and the answer is the same today. I agree with what the Prime Minister had to say yesterday. -  - They want to have a debate about tax. They asked the finance minister about a statement he made 15 years ago. Four years ago the Leader of the Opposition had a lot to say about taxation. In fact, he put forward something like 280 separate proposals. They were not ones that impressed the then Treasurer, who had a few choice words to say about the Leader of the Opposition - but we will come back to that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Questions on the state of the economy these days only come from this side of the House. Perhaps that is because, as the member for Higgins showed yesterday, those opposite regard bad economic news as a political opportunity and encouraging economic news as a great disappointment. I am asked by the member for Dobell about confidence. We know that the stimulus packages of the government have played a very important role in contributing to the solid retail trade figures seen in Australia, but confidence is also vitally important. Confidence underpins spending decisions and investment decisions from the business sector and from households. We know that the opposition regards confidence as very important as well. We know that because last year the member for Wentworth provided the House with some guest lectures on the matter of confidence in the economy via the matters of public importance. With great bravado, day after day, the member for Wentworth told us that confidence was important and that the determinant of confidence on Australia was government policy.He told us that the world economic situation had very little impact, that the Lehman Brothers collapse had little impact and that the global financial crisis and the credit crunch had very little impact. He told us that the only real determinant of confidence levels in the Australian economy was Rudd government policy. We hear a lot less from the Leader of the Opposition about confidence these days. Perhaps it is because Australia has consistently been amongst the best performers in the OECD in 2009 when it comes to consumer confidence. Perhaps it is because confidence in Australia has been above the total OECD consumer confidence in each month since the announcement of the government's stimulus packages. In each month since the announcement of the government's stimulus packages, consumer confidence has exceeded that of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Europe, and on many measures consumer confidence in Australia has returned to precrisis levels, which cannot be said about comparable nations.Of course, there are a range of factors which have contributed to consumer confidence in Australia, but as the chief economist at Westpac, Mr Bill Evans, said:The success which the government's stimulus package has achieved in boosting confidence will be a lesson to other governments including the US which have taken different approaches in their stimulus packages.Restoring confidence has been an important part of the government's economic policy and an important result of our stimulus package. We know the Leader of the Opposition showed very bad judgment when he opposed the government's stimulus package. He showed bad judgment on the stimulus. He continues to show bad judgment today when it comes to confidence. It just goes to show that he cannot be trusted with the nation's government as we move towards recovery.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for her question. Her question no doubt arises as a result of the report on the front page of today's Australian newspaper, a primary source for her. Can I make a number of points. The Chinese authorities at a range of levels, including my counterpart, Foreign Minister Yang, made very strong representations to Australia about the proposed visit to Australia of Rebiya Kadeer and made representations to us that we should prevent her visit. I considered those representations and came to the conclusion that there was no basis for denying her entry to Australia. As a consequence of Australia granting her a visa for the third occasion that she had visited Australia in her private capacity, the Chinese authorities made it very clear to Australian officials that they were most unhappy with her visit. As a consequence of her visit, they indicated to Australia that the proposed visit to Australia of Vice-Minister He to attend the Pacific Islands Forum Post-Forum Dialogue would not occur. They indicated that China would be represented by an ambassador and that, as a consequence of Vice-Minister He not attending the Pacific Islands Forum Post-Forum Dialogue, the proposed and scheduled senior officials' meeting between Australia and China would not -  - I was asked a question about a very important relationship that Australia has with China and I am proposing to answer it. As a consequence of Vice-Minister He not attending the Pacific Islands Forum Post-Forum Dialogue, the senior officials' meeting between Australia and China would also not take place. Both of those actions on the part of Chinese authorities were said by Australian officials to be a direct consequence of, and a direct response to, Australia's decision to allow Rebiya Kadeer to enter Australia - as a direct result of my decision not to interfere with our usual and normal immigration processes. When I made that decision, I indicated to China that Australia of course respected the territorial sovereignty and integrity of China over the western provinces.Australia very much regrets that China has decided to effect that response. Whether China proposes to effect any further responses as a result of our decision to allow Rebiya Kadeer to enter Australia is entirely a matter for the exercise of China's discretion. If China does take further action as a result of us allowing Rebiya Kadeer to come to Australia, we will of course regret that. But the basis of the Australian government's decision is this: we have a longstanding productive economic relationship with China. That relationship started with the decision by the Whitlam government in 1973 to recognise China's one-China policy. Since that time it has grown, starting with minerals and petroleum resources from my own state of Western Australia, to a much more general, broad based relationship. From time to time in any bilateral relationship there will be difficulties. These difficulties need to be managed carefully and successfully, as Australia is currently managing difficulties that we have in our relationship with China - in particular, the visit of Rebiya Kadeer to Australia and the Stern Hu case.I make this final point: if China takes any further action in response to our decision, that will be for us a matter of regret. But we will deal with that matter sensibly, and we will not resort to the flip-flop politicking that the opposition makes of our relationship with China. I vaguely remember the Leader of the Opposition saying to the government some time ago that we should stand up to China. We did on the Rebiya Kadeer issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, because it goes not just to what government is doing in terms of providing stimulus to the economy but to what the private sector is doing to provide stimulus to the economy as well. And that goes, of course, to the future of our major resource projects right across the country - although we spent time earlier in question time today speaking of the critical role of small business.I informed the House yesterday that the government of Australia and the Liberal government of Western Australia had reached an agreement in terms of the responsibility for the storage of CO2 in geological formations under Barrow Island as part of the Gorgon LNG project. That is a particular responsibility in terms of long-term indemnification arising from the sequestration action. But I draw to the House's attention again the absolute financial significance of this project. If this project proceeds - although all approvals are not in place yet, and the Minister for the Environment has matters still to deliberate on - it will be a $50 billion investment. To put this into context, it is the largest single resource project in the country's history. The government stimulus, if you take it together, adds up over time to some six per cent of GDP. This project in itself is worth about 5 per cent of GDP. It is a very large project indeed. That is why the Australian government, together with our other partners, has been actively engaged in deliberations on this with Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell.There are, of course, other projects which are being considered for future development as well. Yesterday I referred to Woodside's $12 billion Pluto 1 development, which is well advanced. Chevron is also progressing the Wheatstone Project by awarding the onshore front-end engineering and design contract. Wheatstone, for the information of honourable members, is to produce first gas in 2016. A final decision to proceed with the project is expected in 2011. This project involves two LNG-processing trains, each with a capacity of 4.3 million tonnes per annum, plus a domestic gas plant and export facilities at Ashburton North, west of Onslow.Finally, Origin Energy today announced that its joint venture with ConocoPhillips, Australia Pacific LNG, had secured the Laird Point site on Curtis Island in the Port of Gladstone as a site for its proposed LNG plant. The construction of this project is estimated to be worth approximately $35 billion and is expected to produce up to 16 million tonnes of LNG per annum.The reason I make reference to these projects is that the government, supported by the resources minister, other ministers in the government and the Treasurer, are actively behind the long-term resources industry of this country. We believe that the decision that we took -  -  - I do appreciate the howls on the part of those opposite. It was this government which took a decision with the Liberal government of Western Australia in a cooperative national interest frame to provide the indemnification necessary concerning the sequestration of the CO2 off the back of the Gorgon project - a necessary precondition for the project proceeding. It was a decision of this government, not of that opposition; a decision of this government in partnership with the Liberal government of Western Australia.That project is of particular interest to the parliament not only because of the job implications - 6,000 Australian workers at the peak of construction and $33 billion worth of goods and services being purchased over 30 years - but also because of the $40 billion, prospectively, in government revenue which will be delivered from the project over time. Of course that is important for the funding of the rest of our much-needed economic and social infrastructure across the country, because the more that we have by way of revenue streams from the resources sector, the less pressure that places over time over the rest of the taxation system.I notice that tax has been a subject of some debate here in this chamber today. I notice that the questions asked by those opposite about the Henry review could well have been asked at any time from May last year. That is when we set up the Henry review, that is when we laid out its terms of reference and that is when we said what exemptions would exist in relation to it on the GST. Since then, that process has been underway: a rational process in public policy development. What has changed today -  - How embarrassing it is for the opposition to be confronted with a Leader of the Opposition whose 279 tax proposals are out there for the entire nation to behold. They have slipped the old Ergas under the table, but when it comes to this one -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I remind those opposite about the question, which went to resource projects and their implications for economic policy across Australia, which includes within it tax policy. The answer I gave before referred to the revenue implications for the Commonwealth flowing from this particular project. I would have thought that $40 billion worth of combined revenue, flowing to state and federal governments, would be of some consequence to the House as we go to our long-term planning on tax. That, of course, has been the subject of what those opposite have raised. But there is an absolute sensitivity of those opposite in having canvassed the Turnbull tax plan in this parliament - actually, you just scratch the surface and they get very anxious indeed - because the Turnbull tax plan is a flat tax. That is what it is. It is about abolishing the upper rate, it is about abolishing the rate underneath that - everyone getting taxed at 15 per cent and 30 per cent. That is what it is about, that is what the opposition are sensitive about - really rich people getting let off with a huge tax cut and poor and middle-income earners not being left with any other rate.The government is so proud of its position on reform because we are prepared to tackle the hard questions: get on with the business of tax reform; get on with the business of health and hospital reform; get on with the business of education reform for the future; get on with the business of the implementation of long-term industrial relations, changes in the economy; and get on with the business of the restoration to the economy of proper economic recovery on the back of what government does by direct investment in the economy and what private sector projects, such as those I referred to in question time today, can do to materially affect the wellbeing of all Australians.I would say to those opposite: why do you constantly engage in the politics of talking down the economy? Why do you constantly engage in the politics of trying to punch our confidence in the economy? Whether it is on tax, whether it is on prices, whether it is on debt, whether it is on deficit, one strategic objective on the part of those opposite - as the Leader of the Opposition smirks and smiles - is to talk down the economy. Can I say to those opposite: why don't you join the project of building up the Australian economy? That is the government's intention. Why don't you get with the action?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I did see the newspaper articles that he refers to concerning that particular installer in the Bundaberg area. I can confirm to the House and to the member that, to go on the register, it is a requirement of installers that they confirm they are privy to and understand all of the responsibilities that are necessary for proper accreditation as installers under the guidelines. On that basis, if there are any instances of installers who are in fact not observing the guidelines then we want to know about it, my office wants to know about it and the department also wants to know about it. There is a 1800 number that is available -  -  - I would have thought that the House would have appreciated the opportunity to know that there are many means by which either members of this House or members of the public can be advised on whether there are difficulties in relation to the installation of ceiling insulation under the government's plan. I make these additional points to the member for Hinkler. The first is that we have a robust compliance and monitoring program underway in order to ascertain whether there are any instalments - The member for Canning then left the chamber.The member for Solomon then left the chamber. - The government will be checking tens of thousands of installations to ensure that they fulfil the requirements of the guidelines. I have asked my department to write to every single homeowner who has currently received ceiling insulation under this program to inquire whether any issues came about as a consequence of the installation. -  - My department has also written to installers reminding them of their particular obligations under the guidelines. Finally, I make this point to the member: I have also asked my department to specifically investigate the matter that he has raised in question time in relation to the installer in Bundaberg and report back to me by the close of business today.And I want to add something more here - now that I have had the opportunity to answer the question that was put to me in some detail by the member - and that is that those opposite opposed putting ceiling insulation into the homes of Australians who want to reduce their energy costs and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It was the member for North Sydney specifically who opposed the fact that we thought that one way of getting jobs into regional communities would be to give people the opportunity to have ceiling insulation and to build local business at the same time.Over 180,000 householders have taken the opportunity to have ceiling insulation in their roofs. Not only are they satisfying the obligations that they have to want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but they are reducing their energy costs as well. This is a program that is working extremely well. If there are any issues that need to be addressed, we will address them in a vigorous and assertive manner.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question and for the opportunity to join him a couple of weeks ago on 'Pollies for Small Business Day', where we visited Gloria Jean's at St Marys. I reckon I made 100 cups of coffee in proper coffee cups. It was a great testament to the commitment of the member for Lindsay to his local small business community.At 11 o'clock today the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry released its latest small business survey. It shows that small business conditions have reached their highest level since November 2008. In fact, the expected future economic performance is reported to have 'surged' - and that is the word that is used in that survey. These survey results build on other recent surveys showing a rebound in business and consumer confidence. The encouraging boost in small business confidence is due, at least in part, to the government's economic stimulus package and its positive effects on jobs and the economy.Opposition members - A very small part! - We hear from those opposite: 'A very small part.' They are all over the place on this, as we know. Last week's Dun and Bradstreet survey concludes:The improvement _ is a sign that the economic stimulus has been successful in encouraging household spending.The ACCI survey reveals that small business expects conditions to remain quite challenging in the coming months. One of the main constraints on investment identified by small business is state government regulations. The Rudd government, through the Council of Australian Governments, is cutting red tape in no fewer than 27 areas of regulatory reform, moving Australia towards a seamless national economy.The opposition leader has hit on the idea of cutting business red tape, too. Indeed, he started a competition to nominate the worst, most idiotic piece of red tape. That competition is being run by my counterpart, the shadow minister for small business - and it is now 447 days since he last asked a question of me. I have decided to enter that competition. In fact, I have two entries. The first is the current requirement on anyone providing financial advice to give a 100-page disclosure statement to each client - introduced by the former Liberal government and being removed by the Rudd Labor government. The second entry is the obligation on small businesses to send superannuation guarantee payments to the individual super funds of each and every employee - introduced by the former Liberal government and being removed by the Rudd Labor government. So I went looking for the stupidest piece of red tape and found that the opposition leader need only look in his own backyard. This is yet another example of bad judgment from the opposition leader - the same bad judgment he showed when he argued against the government's stimulus package.It is time that the opposition leader embraced microeconomic reform, as we remove the impediments to small business success on the road to recovery. But the opposition leader has given responsibility for policy development to the backbench, to the member for Menzies, the architect of Work Choices, which frees up the entire coalition frontbench to engage in its campaign of fear and smear. We know the opposition leader took policy responsibility from the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party because whenever she submitted a policy idea he somehow felt that he had seen it somewhere before. The opposition should abandon its opportunistic campaign of fear and smear and get on board with the Rudd government's program of economic reform for recovery.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is the case that there are some imports of insulation products coming into Australia as a consequence of the government's Energy-Efficient Homes package. I think that is a function of the great success that this stimulus package has had. I make the point to the members opposite and to those listening that, up until the time that the government introduced the fiscal stimulus package and the energy-efficient component of that package, we had local manufacturers starting to lay people off and local insulation factories starting to close down. As a consequence of the decisions taken by the government, we now have local manufacturers operating 24/7 and the industry confirming to me on a number of occasions that they are employing more and more people in order to meet the demand for insulation and to put ceiling insulation into people's homes.The fact is that the homeowners insulation program has been an outstanding success in driving and supporting the local manufacturing industry and it has been an outstanding success in driving employment in those areas that count. I make the point to the member opposite that, when it comes to the supply chain for putting ceiling insulation in a householder's home, it operates something like this. About 30 per cent of the supply chain goes to the insulation. There is a 70 per cent component of activities that are jobs; that refers to those other matters, whether they be dispatch from the factory, driving it down or making sure that the insulation in the roof is done properly. The government is fully committed to ensuring that our local manufacturing industry is well supported and has every opportunity to produce insulation for the home insulation plan, and that is what is happening. We would very much like to see the minimisation of imports from overseas in order to do that. I make the point that we are doing that by having consistent, ongoing consultation with the industry, but the members should be aware that all insulation installed under this package must meet Australian standards; that includes imported product, and there has been no evidence so far that any imported insulation materials do not meet the minimum standards. If there is any indication of that, I invite members opposite to draw it to our attention.At the end of the day, this was a component of the stimulus package that the opposition opposed. Now we can see that it is providing a significant boost to local manufacturing, providing a significant boost to employment and doing the job that it was set out to do, and it will continue to do that.</DOC>

 - That is very interesting after the last question, but I am happy to answer the member's question. Just to put this into context, what we are dealing with is that Australia is one of the fastest-growing developed countries in the world and is dealing with a region that is the fastest-growing region in the world. So, therefore, the meeting in Bangkok over the weekend had for us three important objectives, all of which were achieved. The first was to ensure that we concluded arrangements such that the Australia-ASEAN-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement could come into effect from 1 January next year. The significance of this, of course, is that this is a market of 600 million people. There is already $80 billion in two-way trade between Australia and the ASEAN countries, and it opens up huge new market opportunities for a growth economy - a competitive economy - in a fast-growing region. I am pleased to say that I believe that we will be in a position in which this agreement will come into effect on 1 January next year.The second objective was not just to involve ourselves in the negotiations surrounding our FTA but to look at the consequences of four other FTAs that had been concluded with ASEAN - one by China, one by Korea, one by Japan and one by India. It is very interesting that the previous member's question seemed to think that, somehow, trading and taking cheaper product from China and using our comparative advantage to add value here to increase trade and job opportunities was somehow bad. I make this point: the second issue that we were discussing is how we could take those six free trade agreements that ASEAN has negotiated and develop a convergence so that we could take even better advantage of the opportunities in the region. Think about it: if you add the six to the ASEAN countries, you are talking three billion people and collective GDP of $16½ trillion. Again, we were successful in reaching agreement to find the convergence and the greater integration of the region - the second successful outcome.The third successful outcome was to engage with India, which has undertaken to convene a ministerial meeting in early September to advance further the prospects of concluding the Doha Round. The reason for that meeting is significant. Members might recall that one of the countries with which we were having difficulty concluding the WTO last year was India. The fact is that it is now committed to developing a mechanism and convening a meeting to find the way forward in advance of the Pittsburgh G20 summit, which itself understands the importance of liberalising trade and concluding the Doha Round. That, too, was a significant mechanism. I am happy to report that we are continuing progress in terms of developing trade liberalisation in the region, and I will be happy to report further progress as this government continues to develop this proactive agenda.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because it gives me the opportunity to explain something that I think he would find deeply disturbing: that, under the current student financing arrangements, the participation of regional and rural Australians in universities has gone down. If the current arrangements were working to facilitate the kinds of families that he cares about, we would not have seen that result. So, in terms of the kinds of families he cares about - and I accept that he has raised this because of his personal concern about it - the statistics tell you that the current system is not working. When you talk to people about youth allowance, many can tell you a personal story about a very high income family that has a child living at home and attending university, who, through the gap year provisions, has managed to qualify for full income support. Indeed, the Bradley review pointed to the fact that in a large percentage of cases - 36 per cent of cases, where people are living at home and getting the full allowance - there were these kinds of problems.The Bradley review told us that there were families with incomes of more than $200,000 where people were getting the full student income support and living at home. That is not the circumstance of the families that you are talking about. The families that you are talking about have to send their kids away to study. They are families who earn, by Australian standards, middle incomes. That is why we have changed the parental means test so people in those kinds of income brackets will qualify for youth allowance based on their parental income. It depends, of course, on the number of children in the family but if you had two children in the family studying away from home you could be talking about parental income of up to $140,000 and still qualifying for youth allowance. And, if you do qualify for youth allowance, then you will also qualify for the relocation scholarship - $4,000 in the first year and $1,000 each year thereafter - and you will qualify for the Student Start-up Scholarship of $2,254 a year. - Our changes will deliver greater benefits to the sons and daughters of lower and middle income Australians without requiring them to take a gap year. - The other problem with a gap year, and I am sure the member for Gippsland would be concerned about this, is that if you set up a whole system which requires people to take a gap year in order to qualify, many people who go on that gap year actually never go back into education. We should regret the loss of those children from Australian universities. The system that we are putting forward is one that will make a difference to precisely the families that you are talking about. That stands in stark contrast to the opposition who, in government, did nothing to address the student financing system that was seeing regional and rural participation go down. The National Party was complicit in that, watching regional and rural participation go down. We believe in it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. Last night in the House the government's renewable energy legislation was passed, and that was an extremely important development. The opposition was endeavouring to take a more constructive approach to that legislation - which was welcome - and to appear more constructive on environment issues. Indeed, it was endeavouring to demonstrate that there is some concern on that side about the issue of climate change. However, a fundamental test in this matter is to see this legislation successfully passed through the Senate into law so that the government can pursue and implement the target of 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply coming from renewable sources by 2020. Interestingly, however, it appears that even this issue is not so simple on the coalition side of politics, because there are reports that there was vigorous debate about the approach of the coalition in the party room discussion today. We are happy to see the member for Flinders making it into the chamber safely this afternoon, as we understand that there was a fair bit of anger directed towards the shadow minister on this issue, the approach to be taken -  -  - Not too threatening. The important thing here is that this country needs to take action on both fronts: on establishing the renewable energy target legislation and on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We need consistency in national public policy making on these important issues. It is not enough to be in this place and to support, or not to oppose, the renewable energy target legislation. But, on the other side of the equation - we can all feel good about solar energy and geothermal and wind and wave power, and support the renewable energy target - the real test is the establishment of the carbon price in this economy.It is the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that is going to make the contribution to shift investment away from higher-polluting industries into lower pollution forms of energy generation. The renewable energy target on its own will not achieve the billions of dollars of investment that this country needs in renewable energy sources or reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We need both institutional changes in our economy to secure this important change in the battle against climate change. We need a consistent approach in policymaking, and we need consistency from the opposition side of politics on this issue. It is critical not just to support the renewable energy legislation but also to support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation.There has been too much walking on both sides of the street in national politics from the coalition on a number of key issues. There is an interesting interview in relation to this approach of having it a bit both ways from the doors of Parliament House this morning. The member for Cowan was interviewed at the doors this morning in relation to the stimulus package, and the interview is symptomatic of the approach we see from the coalition in dealing with key policy issues. They come in here, vote against the stimulus package, go out there and say it is good. The member for Cowan was asked the following by a journalist at the doors: 'But do you believe stimulus has helped Australia out of recession?' The member for Cowan responded, 'Well, with that, there has been a lot of money' -  -  - The response by the member for Cowan to the question about the effect of the stimulus was the following: 'Well, with that, there has been a lot of money pumped in and people have spent it. There's no doubt about that. I have been to local retailers in my area, and they say that people over in Western Australia have been spending. They've been spending for a long time now, even recently.' So the journalist asked: 'So Kevin Rudd can claim a bit of the credit for keeping us out of recession?' The member for Cowan went on to respond as follows: 'Well' -  - The member for Cowan in fact went on to say this in response to the question: 'Well, money into the economy is obviously - people do actually spend money, and so there has been some consumer reaction out of that.' The member for Cowan, along with other members of the opposition, of course, thinks it is fine to come in here and vote against the stimulus package, which is having demonstrable positive economic and employment effects, but to go out into the community and adopt an entirely different position. Consistency in politics is extremely important. You cannot, on the issue of climate change, say or present the impression that you support one leg of the institutional changes that are necessary - that is, the renewable energy target - but at the same time never get your act together to present a positive policy position on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and bringing a carbon price into this economy.This is the most significant reform that any government has ever endeavoured to undertake, in the face of one of the greatest challenges that we face, and you cannot produce a policy. The time is coming when the coalition is going to have to overcome the divisions within its ranks, overcome the scepticism about the climate - and the member for North Sydney is not here at the moment. He is fairly typical of the inconsistency as well, Mr Speaker. - The member for North Sydney is on the record as questioning whether human activity is contributing to global warming but on the other hand is out there saying you have to give the planet the benefit of the doubt. You cannot be a sceptic on the one hand and get in touch with your green side on the other; you have to have a consistent position. It is time, in the national interest, that the coalition side of politics got their act together. The time is coming when you will have to take responsibility, come forward, put forward your specific policy positions in relation to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and stand up for the national interest.</DOC>

 - Here we go again with the fear campaign. It is so, so predictable. I have seen those reports today, and it is the case that it is longstanding government practice to not comment on any matters that may or may not have gone to cabinet. Insofar as there are some proposals in the paper today, they were not adopted. What is this all about? This is about those opposite who are so embarrassed by their vote against stimulus, so embarrassed about their opposition to the bank guarantee and the term funding guarantee that all they have got left is a grubby fear campaign. The government is looking to the long-term national interest, through the Henry review - a comprehensive examination of the tax system. I am not going to be in the business of ruling anything in or out, but the one thing I can absolutely predict is that there will not be an alternative fiscal policy put forward in this House by those opposite. What we will get is a daily diet of fear and smear, because they are masters of misjudgement. When their country needed them to show some unity and maturity in this House, where were they? Negative - they are completely negative on everything they do. A fear campaign is no substitute for a policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member, who proudly represents a constituency in the great state of Western Australia in the Commonwealth parliament. Last night in Beijing, ExxonMobil and PetroChina signed Australia's largest ever export deal - a $50 billion contract to supply liquefied natural gas to China. This agreement will provide the basis for the creation of thousands of jobs and will also inject billions of dollars into our economy. This announcement helps bring the Gorgon project to the verge of reality, although as I have mentioned a number of times in this place, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts still has some processes to conclude - as he should.Gorgon would be the largest resources project ever undertaken in Australia. It would create an estimated 6,000 jobs during its peak construction and an estimated 3,500 jobs during the operational life of the project. It would boost WA gross state product by four per cent and provide tens of billions of dollars in revenue for all Australians. I congratulate ExxonMobil and the Gorgon partners, Chevron and Shell, on the progress Gorgon has made to date, and I look forward to seeing the project being brought to a conclusion subject to the completion of environmental processes.The global economic crisis notwithstanding, we are on the threshold of an unprecedented expansion of the LNG industry in Australia. As I told the House yesterday, Chevron is moving toward the further development of its Wheatstone gas project to the south of Pluto. The Japanese company INPEX, in partnership with Total, is progressing with the Ichtys project in Darwin. Woodside's Pluto 1 project is scheduled for completion and will produce its first gas by the end of next year, with exports to Japan commencing in early 2011. I am pleased to advise the House that the CEO of Woodside, Don Voelte, has just announced that Woodside will proceed with front-end engineering design work for stages 2 and 3 of the Pluto project. An expansion of this magnitude would involve an investment of around $20 billion and would generate around 3,500 jobs.Elsewhere in LNG development, we also have major projects centred in and around Gladstone, so ably represented in this parliament by the member for Flynn. We are proceeding with projects in that part of Australia as well - projects including the Australia Pacific LNG, which is a joint venture between Origin and ConocoPhillips; the Gladstone LNG, which is a joint venture between Santos and Petronas of Malaysia; Curtis Island LNG, which is operated by the BG Group with an interest from CNOOC of China, and is aiming to have first LNG in 2013; and LNG International is establishing a smaller project at Fisherman's Landing, aiming to have the first LNG in 2011-12. So not just in Western Australia but also in Queensland, this government is providing every level of possible support it can to bring about these future great economic development opportunities for Australia.Despite the global financial crisis, it is good to see these investments representing confidence in the Australian economy for the long-term future. Of course, each of these projects involves investment in significant private sector infrastructure. In recent times, of course, the public sector has had to step up to the plate because of the withdrawal of private sector investment activity, and we have seen already from the data produced the extent to which our investment strategy in public infrastructure will roll out in the one, two and three years ahead.The nation at large is working together in dealing with the great crisis and challenge represented by the global economic recession, because nearly all people in this country recognise that we are all in this together. Governments Liberal and Labor - Labor government in Canberra, Liberal government in Western Australia - as well as business, unions and the entire community are behind the government and behind the nation, trying to make a difference in reducing the impact on Australian jobs, small business and the economy brought about by the global economic recession.We also as a government face the long-term challenge of how we partner with the private sector in planning best for our long-term infrastructure needs and our long-term skills needs. The great lesson which came out of previous mining booms was as follows: great pressure being placed on our infrastructure and great pressure being placed on our skills. In the government's first year in office, part of the reason for establishing bodies like Infrastructure Australia and Skills Australia was that it put us in a better position to plan for the rollout of infrastructure long term and for the skills formation we need long term as well. If you aggregated all these projects and the skills demand they have for the Australian economy long term, we must do a better job as a nation in bringing all those skills on stream.The country at large is celebrating this project today but also the confidence we see writ large across the LNG sector, but can I say that unfortunately again we have negative comments from various of those opposite today. In fact, we had Senator Joyce going out there and, I believe, talking about Chinese ownership in the resources sector. He says:I've got big problems about their ownership of resources in the ground in Australia and the resources not only in the ground in Australia but also in the territory that is controlled by Australia.That is Senator Joyce today, a day when we have a $50 billion contract signed with China. We had that comment, presumably representing opposition policy on their hostility towards Chinese participation in resource development in Australia in the future. On top of that, when we have this good development for the Australian economy we have the shadow Treasurer going out there and saying it is time for the government to roll back its investment in the nation's infrastructure. The reason why we have confidence in the future on the part of so many Australian companies is that government is stepping up to the plate to do its part in partnership with the private sector, because we earnestly believe that we are in this all together - private sector, public sector and governments at both levels making a long-term difference for the Australian economy. I say to those opposite: stop talking the economy down and help us build the Australian economy up.</DOC>

 - What this question indicates is that the Liberal opposition hates good news. It hates good news about the employment of Australian workers and, because it hates good news about employment, when it had the opportunity in this parliament to support Australian jobs it came in here and voted against our stimulus package - voted against the jobs of Australians. I say to the members opposite: I know that if they were in my position on this side of the chamber they would be up now, saying all of this investment was a vindication of Work Choices. That is what they would have said if they were in government today. They would have got up here and said the only reason money is being spent is because of Work Choices. - I was asked about workplace relations and the Gorgon project. I am answering it and I am making the very simple point that, if the Liberal Party had still been in government, they would have said this was a vindication of Work Choices. - What, in fact, this shows is that you can have fairness and prosperity. I know those sitting opposite do not believe in that, because they never believed in fairness for Australian working people and they never will. If they ever return to this side of the House then Work Choices will be back five minutes later. We all know that. We know that they do not believe in fairness for Australian workers.On the question of union representation arrangements under the Fair Work Act, as the shadow minister should know, if he had read the Fair Work Act, it is of course possible to get representation orders. That is a facility available under the act, should any employer in the country feel that they need a representation order in order to deal with union demarcation issues. That is available to employers right around the country. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is calling out, 'It is a non-union work site.' The Fair Work Act enables people to make their own choices about whether or not they want to be members of the union. - The Fair Work Act enables people to make their own choices about whether or not they want to be a member of the union, and that is the right thing -  - I am making the very simple point that on this side of the House and through the laws we have delivered, we deliver to the Australian people a free choice to decide whether or not they want to be members of a union. I would have thought anybody who believes in democracy believes in that, but clearly the Liberal opposition do not believe in that proposition. Indeed, when they were in government that is the way they acted. In 2007 Australians around this country made a decision that they wanted fairness and decency at work. I acknowledge in the gallery today members of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, who fought for fairness and decency at work, and now they can see firsthand the anti-work rabble they got rid of.An incident having occurred in the gallery - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for that very important question. One of the areas where the global recession is hitting Australia's economy hardest is, of course, in business investment. The last national accounts showed that new private business investment fell by 6.3 per cent in the March quarter. That is the largest single quarter fall in the 23-year history of the series. The latest ABS capex survey found that expected investment in 2009-10 was 11.7 per cent below the equivalent estimate for 2008-09. Of course, it is the government's economic stimulus that is filling this gap. It is absolutely critical to support business. It is absolutely critical to keep the doors open in thousands of small businesses. It is absolutely critical to support employment. Of course, 70 per cent of our stimulus spending will go to infrastructure. It will employ thousands of tradies. It will reverberate right through the supply chain. The latest Access Investment monitor found that, of 118 new projects announced in the June quarter, 104 came from the public sector.Under the previous government, public investment spending averaged a miserable 3.9 per cent of GDP - two-thirds of the rate that the Hawke and Keating governments delivered. This was a period of neglect that left us with a huge infrastructure deficit. The Rudd government have set about redressing that imbalance. We are making massive investment in health, education, transport, clean energy and so on. These investments, as I said before, are critical for small business, tradies and contractors. Growth around the world this year is heavily dependent on the monetary and fiscal stimulus which is being delivered by governments around the world, including ours. A large proportion of the growth next year will come from inventory restocking, as firms around the world rebuild inventories that they ran down during the global contraction.The challenge will be: where will the impetus for growth and investment come from after that? Of course, that is where this Gorgon investment is so important. This $50 billion investment is important because it is an investment for the long term. It is an investment which will enable us to take our share, or a larger share, of earnings from the growth of Asia. So it will deliver more investment, more jobs and more profits to Australian industry. That is why we welcome the news. It does say a lot about our economic prospects. I certainly congratulate all of the partners, because we on this side of the House welcome the good news. We welcome the good news, but all those on the other side can do is talk the economy down. We on this side of the House will get on with the job of investing in the nation for the future.</DOC>

 - As I said before, the Henry review is comprehensive, and we are not going to play their silly, childish game of ruling in or ruling out. But what we can do is have a comprehensive discussion in this House about taxation: what has happened in the past and what could happen in the future. So I welcome questions from the Leader of the Opposition about taxation, because it is pretty hard to put your finger on what the alternative tax policy of the opposition is. We heard yesterday about the Leader of the Opposition's 289 proposals. I am told it was originally 290 but they could not count and left one out -  - We on this side of the House do read all the statements from those over there closely and we have been on the lookout for a tax policy. We know the policy delivered by the Leader of the Opposition when he was shadow Treasurer -  - Yes, Mr Speaker. It was a question about tax policies, and when I was interrupted by the Leader of the Opposition I was referring to the 289 or 290 proposals that he had put forward four or five years ago. But there have been some more contemporary statements. -  - Mr Speaker, it was a question about the 2009 budget and it was a question about tax and what the government may or may not do in that context and policies more generally in that context. It is not every day when you are the Treasurer of Australia that you get a birthday present from your opposite number, but I am pleased to tell the House that on 30 June this year the shadow Treasurer did give me such a birthday present. He attended a business function, I think in Sydney, and he made this statement. When he was asked a question about whether he would abandon the 2009-10 tax cuts, he said -  - I know the Leader of the Opposition does not read all of the statements from 'sloppy Joe' over there, but he ought just to look -  - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. When asked a question about his policy for the 2009 budget and what, when it came to tax, he would do, he said he would have considered cancelling them as part of the mix. This was a question about what we considered or did not consider in the lead-up to the budget and, as I answered before, these matters came forward in that process and they were not adopted. - But what we on this side of the House are very serious about is a comprehensive review of our tax system. It goes to the very core of the attractiveness of this country as a place for investment; it goes to the very core of the living standards of every worker in this country. We will not be stopped by those opposite from having a comprehensive review and we are not going to play their silly political games in this House when it comes to something as fundamental as long-term tax reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Obviously, the benefits from this deal are huge - huge not just for Western Australia but huge for the nation. The other side does not want to hear about this. This is the problem with them. They would prefer to have a circumstance in which they are talking the economy down rather than welcoming the single biggest trade deal in Australia's history. That is what we are recognising today: $50 billion in sales on top of $25 billion that was announced recently for India. These two deals obviously bring the Gorgon project a lot closer to completion. There are, of course, processes that have to be completed, but the government's decision the other day to support the sequestration measures have been a significant factor in this, too. The Gorgon project as a whole is worth $300 billion in sales over the next 20 years. So this is huge. The project itself will be 6,000 jobs. -  - Do you want to hear about this or do you just want to cackle away from the side? There will be 6,000 jobs at the peak of construction and 3½ thousand direct and indirect jobs in addition, because there is $33 billion in purchases of Australian goods and services going into the inputs of this exercise. Revenues to the Commonwealth budget alone will be $40 billion over the course of the next 20 years. We are hearing questions all the time about where the money is coming from and when we are going to move back into surplus. Just have a look at the impact of this single deal - the single biggest trade deal in Australia's history. But, more than that, what this deal does -  - No, a lot of people deserve credit for this -  - but I think we on this side of the House - </DOC>

 - That question from the shadow Treasurer just demonstrates that what we have got over that side of the House is a leaderless rabble that do not whether they are coming or going. We have a comprehensive review, through Dr Henry, of the tax system. Their only contribution to this debate is to come into this House and try and whip up a fear campaign, and they want to do that on the day when we have one of the most significant projects in Australia's history going forward, worth something like $50 billion. Of course the misjudgement or the lack of judgment of the Liberal Party, and in particular the shadow minister, has been on display in our discussion about the importance of today because everyone in this House should be celebrating what is going on with this project - the enormous investment, jobs and prosperity that it will bring this country beyond the global recession.For the shadow Treasurer to go out in his doorstop interview this morning and compare this project to shopping for the weekly groceries at Woolworths or Coles is simply outrageous, and it shows what a lack of judgment the Liberal Party have and how they are only interested in scoring political points. They are not interested in the national interest. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say this morning when he was at the doorstop interview. He said:I'm always prepared to buy something from a vendor - He goes on to ask whether that means you are friends with them:_ When you go shopping do you develop a friendship with a Woolies person or a Coles person?This is what he said in answer to a question about Gorgon. - If the shadow Treasurer thinks that Gorgon bears some relationship to shopping for bread and milk at Woolies or Coles then what that demonstrates is a massive lack of judgment. We came into this House yesterday and described those opposite as masters of misjudgement. It has been demonstrated time and time again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question, and I know she is someone who very much focuses on education and training in her electorate. Today we are of course acknowledging the positive impacts of the Gorgon project for this country, and amongst those positive impacts is the direct employment of many highly skilled Australians. This is a project that will see employment in Western Australia, at the peak of construction, of around 6,000, with more than 3,500 direct and indirect jobs. This is a project that will need people with a variety of skills. It will need builders, welders, boilermakers, plumbers and electricians. It will need professional engineers. Because the project and construction is occurring on Barrow Island, it will require a maritime workforce with all of the skills associated with being in the maritime industry. This will require operations staff who are trained in LNG operations to staff the project at Barrow Island. And of course that skilled labour will not just be supported in direct employment by this project; this project will assist with training the skilled labour of the future.We know that currently in the mining industry in Western Australia there are around 630 Australian apprentices, and through this project and new investment we will see more - more apprentices developing the skills that this nation needs for its future. Supporting Australian apprentices is of course at the forefront of this government's policy. We want to make sure that we are investing in skills today so that we can have the prosperity and productivity we want tomorrow. To date 5,700 West Australians have enrolled in productivity places, with 800 enrolments in areas such as laboratory skills, civil construction, extractive industries and mining - the kind of training a project like this needs.This government has invested in TAFE facilities around the country, including in Western Australia. Through our Better TAFE Facilities program we have provided $22 million to 48 TAFE campuses across Western Australia to upgrade teaching and learning facilities. This includes upgrades in areas like Port Hedland, Newman, Karratha and the Pilbara TAFE. This is once again support for training for the kind of skills that a project of this dimension needs. Of course training is about these statistics - it is about the picture of investing new money in capital. But it is also about the human face of the people who undergo training and the employers who support them in that training. In that regard I would like to acknowledge as the human face of training the training leaders of tomorrow who have joined us in parliament today through Group Training Australia. You young people are very welcome in this parliament today. These young people are undergoing training today and are bound to be leaders of the future.Can I also acknowledge the support that employers give to their young people in training. We celebrated and recognised that support at the training awards which happened in this Parliament House last night and which some members of this parliament were able to attend. We recognised 23 outstanding employers from regions across Australia. Their passion and commitment to developing skills and training people of all ages, but particularly young Australians, was truly inspiring. This is a great project which will support training in the future - exactly what this nation needs for its future prosperity and productivity.</DOC>

 - That is a bit rich coming from the previous government, which was the highest taxing government in Australia's history. When they were in government, their record on taxation was the highest level of tax in our history. This government are serious, as I said before, about the Henry review. We are serious about a comprehensive look at the tax system, to make it simpler, to put more incentive in it and to make it more competitive. Nothing could be more important to this country's future than tax arrangements, and nothing could be more important to future investment in this country than having an internationally competitive tax system. That is absolutely relevant to what we need to do to expand our capacity for the future. That is why it is so encouraging to see the Gorgon project go ahead. It is a massive investment for the country. But it is not one that those opposite can acknowledge. The fact is that the Liberal Party would rather see the country fail than see investments like Gorgon proceed. - The inability of those opposite to have a position on tax - except for the utterings of the shadow Treasurer at a conference a few months ago, or the proposals that were put forward by the current Leader of the Opposition four or five years ago - just shows what a divided, incapable, incompetent rabble they have become.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question. The global financial crisis and recession has knocked a big hole - about $210 billion - in the government's revenue. That has necessitated borrowing to enable us to protect the Australian economy. We have set out a tough set of rules to enable us to return the budget to surplus, but it is great irony that the biggest obstacle to returning the budget to surplus is in fact the group of people who carry on the most in public about how important it is to return the budget to surplus, and of course I refer to the opposition.In spite of all of their rhetoric and posturing about debt and deficit, you need to look at what they do - their behaviour. Here is just a sample: blocking reform of Commonwealth dental programs, savings that the government in opposition committed to make - blocking that in the Senate; blocking reforms to the private health insurance rebate and thereby knocking out $1.9 billion in savings from the government's budget; and, most recently, demanding that the government adopt the Frontier Economics model of a carbon pollution reduction scheme, which would add an additional billion dollars plus to the budget deficit by 2020 were that to occur.But today we have seen a further manifestation of their behaviour in this regard and, indeed, a further manifestation of their coherence. The behaviour I refer to was seen at a press conference by the member for Dickson, who indicated that, contrary to the commitment made at the Press Club on 20 May by the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, the opposition are now preparing to also block in the Senate changes to the Medicare safety net - changes which would result in savings of $450 million to the budget. These changes are necessitated by the huge amounts of money that have been flowing to a tiny group of specialists - on average, $4.5 million each out of the public purse to the top 10 per cent of specialists. And it has been indicated today by the member for Dickson that the opposition are contemplating blocking these changes.We have to ask the question here: who is in charge over there? We have had the phoney tough guy, the member for North Sydney, saying, 'Don't worry; we're going to support all these savings,' and yet today the member for Dickson has indicated that the opposition may possibly block them in the Senate. The 'whose in charge?' question was today illuminated a bit further by the extraordinary performance of the member for O'Connor and the Leader of the Opposition. We have seen them walking out, we have seen them walking back in and we have seen the member for O'Connor summons the Leader of the Opposition over to the back bench to get some instructions - an extraordinary rabble performance. Some leaders are arrogant, some are weak and some are rash, but this leader of the opposition has the trifecta. For the first time in Australian political history, we have a leader of the opposition who, all in one, is arrogant, weak and rash at the same time. - I was asked about obstacles to returning the budget to surplus and was pointing out that the biggest obstacle is the total incoherence of the opposition. The mad uncle has taken over the opposition and the member for North Sydney, who dubbed him that, has just let that happen.I would like to conclude with a contrast - the government on the one hand and the opposition on the other. The government is early, decisive and takes action; the opposition says, 'Do nothing.' The government is united; the opposition divided. The government is acting in the national interest; the opposition in its own interests._ a Minister 'should not engage in irrelevances', such as contrasting the Government and Opposition - and I ask you to direct the minister not to proceed, as in accordance with the previous ruling. - No sooner do we have the mad uncle taking over than the mad aunty is launching a challenge!</DOC>

It is being conducted independently and is having a complete look at everything within its terms of reference. I also went to great lengths yesterday to point out that, when it came to the article in the Australian about capital gains tax on homes, they were matters that I rejected and that there was no truth in the propositions put forward. I described them yesterday as fiction. There is no basis or foundation for the claims made by the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I am asked about the Gorgon deal, I am asked about implications of that deal for relations with China and I am asked about any challenges to our relationship with China. I very much welcome the Gorgon announcement. It is the largest trade and investment decision in our country's history. Some of us on this side have been supporting this project in advance of the Gallop government's in-principle decision to approve the project in September 2003. I welcome the very strong support that we saw from the Gallop government, the Carpenter government and, to its great credit, the Barnett government.I am asked about the implications of the deal for Australia's relationship with China. Of course, this arrangement will have significant benefits for our economic relationship and partnership with China. Indeed, it is testimony to the strength of our economic relationship with China. As I indicated to the House yesterday, our relationship with China started with our early recognition of it by the Whitlam government. It started in economic terms with minerals and petroleum resources from Western Australia. But we now see a much broader both economic and bilateral relationship, reflected by the fact that early last year we saw Foreign Minister Yang come to Canberra to conduct the first strategic dialogue between Australia and China, and that was replicated with the second strategic dialogue when I visited Beijing in the first quarter of this year.So our relationship with China continues to be strong and productive and very focused on the economic complementarity between Australia and China. The fact is that we are a reliable, safe and secure supplier of resources and that China's economy continues to develop and be enhanced.I am asked about any challenges to that relationship. Any significant bilateral relationship always has challenges, and sometimes there are threats. But what are the challenges? Until very recently, the government and the opposition, both sides of this House, understood that our relationship with China was important economically and strategically, as reflected by the recent holding of strategic dialogues, but also complex and complicated - not a relationship that could be dealt with simplistically. That was until very recently, but recently, regrettably, we have seen challenges to the relationship presented by people taking a very simplistic approach to our relationship with China and raising spectres of misjudgment, miscalculation, naivety and simplicity. We saw some of that yesterday, with the question from the opposition about potential consequences of the government's decision to allow Rebiya Kadeer to come to Australia, and I was left wondering overnight whether indeed the opposition supported the government's decision in that respect.As well as that, recently we have seen the Leader of the Opposition somehow thinking, believing or pretending that the difficult and complicated Stern Hu case can be dealt with in some way by megaphone diplomacy, raising very serious questions about miscalculation and misjudgement on his part. I wonder whether at some stage the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for foreign affairs might want to tell the House just how many representations they had from the Australian business community about adopting a different approach on that matter.But yesterday we saw the doozy of them all. On the very day on which we saw the single largest trade decision in the country's history made, the single largest trade decision made in respect of China and Australia, we saw the Leader of the Opposition say the relationship was at its lowest ebb. Have we ever seen a more fundamental miscalculation or misjudgement? No wonder that the Australian community will be asking the very serious question as to whether this complex, complicated and very important relationship could be trusted in the hands of a Leader of the Opposition so prone to miscalculation and misjudgment.This relationship is economically very significant. It is predicated by a number of things, including that of course Australia and China have different systems and different values, and from time to time there will be differences which need to be carefully and successfully managed, just as the government is carefully and successfully managing the Rebiya Kadeer issue and the Stern Hu case - not in a manner of simplicity, naivety, politics, miscalculation and misjudgment, which the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe is the best course to follow.This is a most significant decision as far as trade and investment is concerned. It is a very significant decision for the long-term benefits of Australia and the long-term productive economic partnership between Australia and China.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. Yes, the government will be attending, through the cabinet, a community cabinet meeting in Port Macquarie next week. From recollection, I think it is either the 13th or 14th community cabinet, which the government has conducted in each state and territory of the Commonwealth. We regard this as an important way of maintaining contact with local communities and responding to local community needs and we look forward very much to the engagement with his community at Port Macquarie.In response to a question from the honourable member earlier in terms of the Port Macquarie hospital, I indicated that both the health minister and I would be making arrangements to visit that hospital, and I assume that those arrangements are being put in place. If not, I am in real trouble - but I assume all that is underway. Secondly, on the question of the Nancy Bird Walton aviation project, one of the reasons we attend community cabinets is to provide an opportunity for local business proposals and local community infrastructure proposals to be put forward either to me or to other relevant ministers in the individual sessions which are organised between those organisations and the ministers of the cabinet and more broadly, if it is of wider community concern, for public questions to be raised in the public forums which attend those community cabinets. Therefore, I invite the honourable member to organise such a meeting with me and, I am sure, the minister for infrastructure, who also happens to have responsibility for aviation - not wishing to dob you in, Albo - to participate in such meetings.Can I say more broadly that the vehicle which we have to provide assistance at this time to particular communities which are going through difficult periods of adjustment through high levels of unemployment, coming off the back of the global economic recession, is our $1.5 billion Jobs and Training Compact with the nation. That involves a compact with young Australians based on a principle of 'earn or learn' and the provision of sufficient training places to ensure that if our young people cannot enter the workplace, they have provided for them an appropriate training place so that when we come out of this global economic recession an appropriate job can be obtained for them, as they will have been upskilled.Secondly, of course, we have a compact with Australians who have been retrenched, through no fault of their own, because of the global economic recession, and there are specific provisions which pertain under that as well. But the third, which is of direct relevance to the honourable member's question, is our local jobs fund - a $650 million fund, a $300 million component of which goes to the consideration of possible community infrastructure projects. I am looking for advice from the minister, but I understand that the first round of applications for projects under that fund has been put out there and that applications have come in. The figure that I can recall is that there are some 3,000 applications for projects submitted by various local authorities around the country. We, therefore, based on departmental advice, will consider those various applications. I understand that there will be further rounds available as well.Can I say to the honourable member, therefore, that - because of the existence of that local jobs fund, and the community infrastructure fund within it, which I think runs to some $300 million - we will take representations from him and his local community organisations seriously. What we are seeking to do is to not only maintain touch with local communities around the country but do what we can to take the edge off the impact of the global economic recession on local unemployment rates.Unemployment rates - as was brought home to me again graphically a week or two ago in Far North Queensland when I was there with the member for Leichhardt at the time of the Pacific Islands Forum - in various regions of the country are very high, unacceptably high. Therefore, the reason why there is this other set of initiatives on top of our national stimulus strategy, tailored specifically to local needs where you have, in particular, high levels of unemployment, is to provide us with the basis of engaging the needs which he represents.So I look forward to engaging the Nancy Bird Waldren -  
Opposition members - Walton! - I apologise for my misrendering of the name; we are all capable of misrendering pronunciations, and I am as well. But I look forward to meeting the representatives of that project when we gather soon at Port Macquarie, and we will see how it stacks up on the merits, and we will see how it stacks up against the evaluation of the relevant government department.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. As I indicated yesterday, and as the House is well aware, the renewable energy legislation that the government has put forward, consistent with its target of achieving 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply from renewable sources, has passed this House. But I can also inform the House that it has been the subject of successful negotiations with representatives of the opposition, and that of course is a welcome development which is respected by the government. My colleague Senator Wong, the minister for climate change, will be outlining the details of the agreement between the government and the opposition in relation to the renewable energy legislation very shortly.This has been achieved not without some wobbles from the other side of politics, and there have been a number of things over the last couple of days which have been of some interest, and which I think just give us some further insight into the challenges that lie ahead to successfully prosecuting the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme through the parliament. Even the Leader of the Opposition was reported yesterday in the Sydney Morning Herald by the journalist Mr Phillip Coorey as having told the Ai Group forum that there was:_ nothing wrong with being a climate change sceptic.That is reaching out there a fair way to try to establish some unity on the opposition side of politics, but it will be extremely important, as we move forward in tackling climate change, that we can successfully prosecute discussions about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme as well.If it is difficult to get unity on the opposition side of politics over the renewable energy legislation, it is certainly not going to be an easy issue with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. But, nonetheless, leadership in politics is about tackling those difficult issues, because, as I indicated to the House yesterday, the establishment of a carbon price in our economy is the critical measure that is going to be needed if we are going to move to a lower pollution future and reduce our emissions, and this is what will drive investment towards low-emission energy sources. It is incumbent upon the opposition to achieve a unified policy position in relation to emissions trading. In the same way as has been proven possible on the renewable energy legislation, it is important that the opposition can reach a policy position on the carbon pollution reduction scheme legislation and come forward in a more constructive manner than we have seen to date on such important reform with specific amendments to the legislation that reflect the concerns on that side of politics. If the opposition -  - This is extremely important for public policy making in this country. If the opposition has concerns about the carbon pollution reduction scheme legislation, it will not be good enough to be producing consultants reports that do not form policy. What is necessary, if there is a concern about emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries, is to come forward with specific policy proposals and amendments that have the support of the coalition party room. If there are concerns about the treatment of agriculture, come forward with specific amendments dealing with agriculture. If there are concerns about electricity generators, come forward with specific amendments that deal with the issues. And the same goes for any other area of policy that has been raised by the opposition side of politics on these issues - coalmine fugitive emissions or the like. It is an important development that we are able to prosecute the renewable energy legislation, but the hard yards lie ahead. The prosecution of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is fundamentally important for the environmental and economic future of this country. Take responsibility. Unify around it. Show leadership. Deliver an outcome. And come forward to the government with your concerns.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I am not aware of the context of the answer that was given to someone over the phone. What I am aware of are the measures that the government has put in place to deal with the question of the installers properly observing the guidelines when they actually put ceiling insulation in the roofs under this very successful program.I do know that, in response to the matters that the member has raised, my office has contacted Mr Neville to inform him on the question of the progress of the complaint against Mr Johnson which he raised yesterday, that the department will be conducting an immediate audit of all 33 claims carried out by that company and that the department's legal team yesterday initiated a process requiring Mr Johnson to show cause as to why he should not be struck off the register of installers. I can say, through you, Mr Speaker, to the member that any new complaints should also be directed to my office for immediate consideration, and we will consider them.Can I just make an additional observation here, and it is simply this: the department thus far has received a very small number of complaints under this program, covering less than 0.2 per cent of all installations. They are investigated by an audit and compliance team, and anyone with concerns should contact their relevant fair trading authority and/or the insulation hotline. The fact is that 0.2 per cent of complaints have come into a program that is unprecedented in its scope and unprecedented in its take-up. The fact is that, since 3 February, over 61,000 households have had solar hot water installed, and over 185,000 households have had ceiling insulation installed as at 17 August.The job component in this ceiling insulation program is significant. If the opposition had had their way - they opposed this stimulus package - we would not have these jobs at all. On the question of compliance, we will ensure that any issues that are raised by members in respect of compliance will be followed through promptly and diligently.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. As the House would be aware, yesterday the Senate vote on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities, and Other Measures) Bill 2009 was tied at 34 votes apiece, ensuring, of course, the defeat of the bill. -  - As those opposite, as if on cue, show the sort of ideological extremism that we have seen from them all through this debate, I remind the House that this debate was not about a continuation of the battles of the past that those opposite have engaged in for so long. This was about providing a practical, balanced and new way forward to ensure that our students had the services and representation that they needed and that our higher education sector was well supported. Whilst those opposite get all excited, I think we should all reflect on the fact that there are serious consequences of yesterday's decision.The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, Michael Spence, described yesterday's outcome as 'a major blow which will have a devastating effect on students'. As a consequence of yesterday's decision, we will see the further demise of critical university services, including child care, counselling, health and sport. As University Australia chief, Dr Glenn Withers, said yesterday - and those opposite might want to listen to this:Students most in need will suffer the most from the failure of this legislation to pass the Senate. Without proper support for student-sensitive services such as advocacy, counselling, health, and legal support, students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are particularly vulnerable to dropping out of university studies should they face significant up-front costs in accessing these services _We also know that as a consequence of this decision some universities will struggle to provide the support services which are necessary to both attract and retain the overseas students that we know are so vital to our higher education sector and our broader economy.We will also see the continued movement of funds out of teaching and research budgets and into propping up student services which are vital to the university. This is a point made not just by me and not just by government members but by the Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Professor Ian Chubb, and Professor Stephen Parker, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra. They said yesterday that without the vital cash injection this legislation proposes, Australian universities will continue to face an impossible choice between putting money into labs and classrooms or into sports fields and health facilities. While those opposite might choose to celebrate this devastation of our university sector -  -  - While those opposite might find it funny, the one thing that we can say for the Liberal Party on this is that they have been consistent. The Liberal Party have been consistent in being completely blinded, all through this debate, by the sort of extremism that brought about Work Choices. We have seen that. But what is particularly interesting about this debate, and what I think we should focus on today, is the role that the National Party have played in this - in blatantly selling out the interests of the bush once more. It is particularly interesting on a day when we have seen them rise in this place and claim to care about the plight of regional students. Let us consider this. It is well established that regional campuses have been the hardest hit by this legislation. We know this. I refer to Professor Sandra Harding, Vice-Chancellor of James Cook University, who said that the current approach has 'hit regional campuses particularly hard, as there is no metropolitan area providing readily available alternative services'.We also know that the support services offered at regional universities create much-needed jobs. But it is not just the vice-chancellors and it is not just the government who say that it is regional universities that are being hit the hardest; it is the National Party themselves. Perhaps I should quote the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, who said on this matter as recently as November, 'VSU has been a fiasco for regional universities.' So I say to those opposite: you like to stand up in here, you like to talk and move motions in the morning, but yesterday you had your chance to stand up for regional students and you squibbed it. Yesterday we saw that the Liberal Party were once again guided by their extreme ideology. The National Party once again said one thing in the bush and did another thing when they were here in the parliament. But I can assure everyone that we on this side, we in the government, remain absolutely committed to restoring services and amenities to our campuses to ensure that we have world-class universities that are capable of attracting overseas students, and we will continue to find a way forward for our higher education sector.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister, the member for Sturt, for his question, and I thank the shadow Treasurer for his interjections, because it may cause him to reflect on the additional money we are putting into quality teaching, $550 million; the additional money we are putting into disadvantaged schools, $1.5 billion; the money we are putting into literacy and numeracy, $540 million; and it goes on. The shadow minister's commitment to education is such that during the course of this year he has put one speech on his website. There are more speeches on his website about how the Liberal Party has lost its way than there are speeches about the future of Australian education. - On the question from the shadow minister, I will check the facts, because the shadow minister's work rate would not lead you to believe that his research is likely to be right. He did say when he held the photograph up that he had simply obtained it from the internet. So, firstly, I will check the facts. Secondly, I would say to the shadow minister opposite: is he suggesting that small schools in this country should not get federal government support? If he is suggesting that, then I will be very happy to convey that message on his behalf to every small school in this country. Of course, it would be a subset of a broader message, which would be that the Liberal Party has got no policies on education and does not support 'a' school building or 'a' school refurbishment under the Building the Education Revolution program, because they voted against it for all schools.On the question of allocations, allocations are correlated with school size; that is true. We also have flexibility in the BER guidelines to work with states and territories and block grant authorities in the independent and Catholic school systems on allocations for schools if the schools believe that a reallocation is necessary to best meet student needs. I see the shadow minister is laughing at that, but I have got a lot of respect for the people who run the block grant authority in the Catholic education system - the various Catholic education officers around the country. I am prepared to take their advice; he may not be. I am prepared to take advice from the block grant authorities that run independent schools around the country. They run many fine schools and I am prepared to take their advice. I am also prepared to take advice from states and territories about school systems around the country.Here we have once again a Liberal Party with no policies, plans or perspectives on education and with a decade of failure which we are now addressing - a Liberal Party that came into this parliament and voted against the biggest school modernisation program in this nation's history - and all they can do on education is come in and carp and moan, because they are incapable of a positive vision. The Australian people deserve better. They deserve a debate on education. Australians around this country are debating education. The entity left out of that debate is the Liberal Party. It comes down to the lack of judgment of the Leader of the Opposition in putting someone so incompetent and lazy in the shadow portfolio.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield. I know from visits to his electorate that he is very excited about the repairs and maintenance being done to 155 homes in his electorate at a cost of $11.1 million and about the stage 1 construction of 78 new dwellings in his electorate at a value of $14.4 million. Builders and tradies around the country have been telling me that the government's commitment to building social housing through the economic stimulus package has really helped them weather the worst international economic conditions in three-quarters of a century. In fact, at a newly built home I visited with the member for Blaxland, one of the supervisors of the company that had built that home, Adam Iacono, told me that 52 individual people, including three apprentices, had worked on that dwelling at various times. Two of them had been kept on because this new work had come through and one extra apprentice had been put on because of the new work.Yesterday in Canberra, Stuart Sampson from Vogue Constructions told me that they had put on extra staff, too - one extra full-time member and one extra part-time member - because of the stimulus package. He also said that the subcontractors that they were working with had nine apprentices working on this site. At Chelsea in Melbourne's south-east, Charlton Knight from Blue Bay Painters won a contract to paint 20 houses, and because of that he put on two extra staff. In Adelaide, Mr Don Belperio, the owner of Lodge Construction and Building, told me:Building work has picked up since the stimulus money. It was slacking off earlier in the year. I have had to put on more subcontractors - electricians, plasterers, concreters, ironworkers, floor covering specialists, gyprockers and labourers.It is great to hear about those companies right around Australia putting on extra people to do the extra work that is coming through the social housing building.One of the other things that we wanted to do through the social housing stimulus package spend is look at projects that were struggling for funds to complete the projects because of the credit crunch and say to the states and territories, 'If you can prepurchase some of these homes from these projects that were stalled, perhaps we can get the whole project going; perhaps we can support employment in that way.' I am very happy to report that that is exactly what is happening. I am very happy to say that we estimate that an additional 2,000 private dwellings have been built because of our investment in social housing. Projects have been able to proceed because states and territories have been able to prepurchase some of these dwellings. Whole projects have proceeded.I will give just one example. In the member for Port Adelaide's electorate, at Mawson Lakes, I met a terrific woman, Fairlie Delbridge, the managing director of Delcooke Property Group, which is building, I think, 20 new units there. She told me:I had made a large investment in getting this development going. At the preliminary stage of the development I had only nine presales. Then the global financial crisis hit and I couldn't get funding. Banks stopped lending. By the time the stimulus package was announced, I had 12 presales but the project still wasn't bankable.Normally, of course, it would have been, but the credit crunch meant that it was not.When Housing South Australia purchased five units, it absolutely got my development over the line. With 17 presales it made the project eminently bankable. It green-lighted my whole project.That is exactly the type of flow-on effect we hoped this would have, and we calculate that it involved an extra 2,000 properties - extra jobs for tradies and apprentices around the country and extra affordable homes for Australian families.</DOC>

 - I confess to some surprise in the question. I assumed that the member was going to ask me about a school in Mosman! I will look at the school that he has raised with me. Let me assure him that the way the Building the Education Revolution program works is that there is a limitation on project costs and on administration fees. I will look at the example that he has raised with me and we can work through it. I am sure that when we work through it some of the things that the member has put in his question will turn out not to be right. But, given that he wants me to look at an individual school, I will certainly do so.Can I say more broadly in respect of the Building the Education Revolution program, I understand that the Liberal Party squirms each and every day in embarrassment because of its lack of policies on education and because it failed to support the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. When I travel to schools and I see the delight with which this program is being received, I can understand why members opposite who travel to schools would find school principals, teachers and students saying to them, 'Why did you oppose us getting these extra facilities?' So I understand the carping, the moaning and the whingeing to try and cover that up. - Can I assure the House that we will continue to deliver the Building the Education Revolution program. Parents and teachers want better facilities in Australian schools. The Australian community supports that. The Liberal Party obviously is a party that cares so little about education and supporting Australian jobs it could not see its way to supporting it.In respect of the last question asked of me by the shadow minister for education, I have now been advised that the school that he raises is on French Island in the electorate of Flinders. It is a small island with a limited number of people. For some reason it has always been hated by the Liberal Party. It is where Gorton and Bolte wanted to put a nuclear power station in an earlier iteration of Australian politics. The Liberal Party might not think the people of French Island deserve things, but we do. I would also ask the House to note that the Building the Education Revolution program comes with a community-use obligation - that is, facilities built under that program are used by community members. I do not know why the member for Flinders would not want a new facility for community members in his electorate. Presumably, he is continuing the historic antipathy towards French Island from the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde, who has a particular interest in health reform. We recently visited Logan Hospital together where millions of dollars of investment are going into a new emergency department. I know he takes an interest in these issues. As part of the health reform commission's report, to date six consultations have been undertaken by the Prime Minister and me, and several more are coming in the following weeks. In fact, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Ageing are visiting Nepean Hospital on Friday, and I am going to the Gold Coast on Monday to host a consultation at Griffith University with many specialists and health professionals from the Gold Coast region.As the diligent minister that I believe I am, I made sure that I read the material in the local papers. I took it upon myself to make sure that I read the local papers from the Gold Coast and I stumbled upon some very interesting material in the Gold Coast Bulletin. The Gold Coast Bulletin covers some comments about the shadow health spokesperson. You might have thought this would aid our discussion on Monday about health reform, that it might have been about health debates, about health policy or about health investments. But, in fact, it is an article called 'Parachutes ready' by Sue Lappeman and it is about how the Liberal Party is ensuring that the member for Dickson, the shadow health spokesperson, can be parachuted into the seat of McPherson. - Of course, this is particularly relevant because it goes directly to the role of the shadow health spokesperson, who you would think in a national debate about health reform might actually be - The member for Fadden then left the chamber. - The Gold Coast is an important region in Australia, as we know. It is a fast-growing community. The problems at Gold Coast Hospital are well known, because of the boom in the population and of course the ageing population. That is why it is important for us to be holding a consultation in the Gold Coast. In fact, it is a point that is also made in the article. The article, by Sue Lappeman, says:The Gold Coast is at a critical stage in its development and needs someone who will fight for what it needs, not a show- pony more intent on a spot on the frontbench.Interestingly, the article - All imputations of improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly.I invite you to apply the one-hour rule to the very disorderly minister. - Of course, the question does refer to reports and media reports from the Gold Coast, the region I am indeed visiting on Monday to talk about their health concerns, important issues within the community. - It is interesting that the member for O'Connor is interjecting so much, because it means that I am required to read another paragraph in the article, which says:It all made me wonder in what parallel universe we are in where someone like Mrs May retires yet the Three Placebos - A minister can only be questioned on the following matters, for which he or she is responsible or officially connected:public affairs;administration; orproceedings pending in the House.Previous Speakers have specifically ruled out ministers trying to answer questions about matters internal to other political parties, and I ask you to sit the minister down who is pushing your patience and the patience of the House. - I can certainly do that very quickly, Mr Speaker, when I finish this quote, which says:_ Mrs May retires yet the Three Placebos - the bird-flipping Bill Heffernan, muppet-like Wilson Tuckey and just plain frightening Bronwyn Bishop - can still lurch around causing havoc.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Today marks an important milestone for the people of Afghanistan with the holding of the first Afghan-led presidential and provincial council elections in 30 years - an opportunity for the people of Afghanistan, brutally oppressed under the Taliban regime until 2001, to have their voices heard. Credible elections are critical to strengthening Afghanistan's democratic process and institutions and consolidating the progress made since the 2004 elections. There will be something like 6½ thousand polling stations, including dedicated polling stations for women, across Afghanistan, which should give access to about 85 per cent of Afghanistan's 16 million registered voters. I note recent comments by the UN Secretary-General's special representative, Kai Eide, that the vigorous election campaign represents a milestone in the political maturity of Afghanistan. The government and, I am sure, all members of this place condemn the acts of violence that we have seen by the Taliban and others across Afghanistan in recent times seeking to disrupt this election process - in particular, Tuesday's suicide bombing in Kabul which claimed the lives of both UN and ISAF personnel as well as Afghan civilians.Australia, along with other coalition partners and our partners in Afghanistan itself, has worked hard over many months now in preparation for these elections. They are among the most complex and difficult to conduct anywhere in the world, simply because of the terrain of Afghanistan, the challenging geography, and the security environment. Australia has provided extensive assistance to support these elections - including some 120 troops to assist with election security and $9 million in funding for voter registration, education and public outreach activities - and has established the independent Electoral Complaints Commission of Afghanistan. The government is supporting a regional election observer mission, which will see 50 men and women from countries of the immediate region serving as observers throughout the electoral process. We have also supported the training of some 200 female Afghan election observers to allow women to participate more easily in the election process. The government is deploying a small team of Australian civilian observers, the precise role and deployment of which, of course, will be determined according to the security situation.Australia's mission in Afghanistan remains clear: firstly, strategic denial of Afghanistan as a training ground and operating base for global terrorist organisations; secondly, stabilisation of Afghanistan through a combination of military, police, civilian and economic efforts; and, thirdly, to work with our partners in Oruzgan Province to strengthen the capability of the Afghan security forces so that they can in turn ultimately assume responsibility for their own security. The Australian government has a clear-eyed view in terms of the challenges which lie ahead, as do our coalition partners, and in this place and across the nation at large we must always be prepared for our nation to suffer further losses of our men and women in the field. This is a difficult, dangerous and bloody operating environment, as I know all members in this place are aware.It is critical that the international community remain engaged in Afghanistan. The events of recent years, starting with the attacks in the United States on September 11 and the subsequent attacks in Bali, Jakarta and Mumbai, highlight the absolute importance of continuing to tackle the threat of terrorism worldwide and, wherever we can, denying terrorists a training base such as historically they have had in Afghanistan. I also, on behalf of all members of this place and all right-thinking Australians, wish the people of Afghanistan every success on this historic day.</DOC>

 - This is a bit rich coming from a member of a government that was the highest taxing government in Australia's history. They were a big taxing and very big spending government, and it has fallen to this side of the House to put some rigour back into the budget to deal with the structural issues in the budget that were created by those opposite. Over in the Senate they are opposing our proposals to means-test the private health insurance rebate. For them to ask this question at this stage, for them to come into this House and conduct a fear campaign on debt, just shows how hypocritical they are. They have not got a fiscal policy. All they can do is run these fear campaigns.They are running these fear campaigns because the only thing that unites those opposite is their hatred of the government. That is the only thing that unites those opposite: their hatred of the Labor Party. They cannot come together with the government in the national interest to support economic stimulus, to support the bank guarantees and to support all of those things we have done to cushion our economy from the worst impacts of a global recession. They are a rabble, and that has eventuated because of the weak leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. It was on display in this House yesterday and it is on display in this House every time he asks a question where he puts forward a proposal to create a fear campaign. On this side of the House, there is no doubt that we take the nation's long-term interests very seriously, unlike those opposite who only act in their own self-interest. It is in the long-term national interest for this country to have a mature discussion about tax reform and that is what we are going to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the House will be aware from the remarks made by the government and by the companies in recent days, there have in fact been good developments as far as Australia's natural gas sector is concerned. Of course, those developments hinge in part on Australia being viewed internationally as a reliable destination for large amounts of foreign investment. In that respect, I draw to the House's attention a Dun and Bradstreet global risk indicator, released just today, which describes Australia as a safe haven for business investment. Australia's rating was DB1d, which is the equal highest ranking achieved anywhere in the world. The only other countries to achieve this rating were Canada, Norway and Switzerland. Australia has the highest rating awarded to any economy in the Asia-Pacific region. According to D&amp;B's CEO, Christine Christian:The latest GRI rankings show that Australia is a low risk environment for business investment.Furthermore, she makes this observation:The world is continuing to change at a rapid pace and although Australia is faring well compared to other nations we cannot afford to stand still.She is right. She is absolutely right. This is good news in terms of international investor perceptions of doing business in Australia and, in particular, investing in Australia. That brings us back to the question of LNG investments and those at considerable scale - and it is good to have the Minister for Resources and Energy back from Beijing.Earlier this week in Beijing, Exxon Mobil and PetroChina signed Australia's largest ever export deal, a $50 billion contract to supply liquefied natural gas to China from the greater Gorgon project - a fact which, in itself, seems to have elicited a particular response on the part of those opposite yesterday. - And they seem remarkably silent on it today. The project will have a 40-year life and will generate export income and jobs for decades. The first 30 years of the life of this project will boost Australia's GDP by $65 billion in net present value terms. The project will return more than $33 billion to the economy through the use of Australian goods and services over the project. The project will generate 6,000 jobs in the construction phase and will run for around five years in construction. The return in tax revenue over the life of the project will be in the order of $40 billion. - The member for Sturt, characteristically, mindful that he has the national bipartisan economic interest at stake here, interjects in a most negative fashion and says that there is in fact no role for government in respect of any element of this project. He is wrong on that point. - Perhaps the member for Sturt could lead a South Australian walkout of the chamber today, given the success of the WA walkout yesterday! Mr Speaker, his interjection went to this question: what is the role for government in relation to these projects?I draw his attention to the fact that earlier this week I advised the House that there were three outstanding matters in relation to the Gorgon project which we have been working on with the government of Western Australia and the joint venture partners to resolve. The first was a commitment by government to indemnify the joint venture parties against third-party claims following the closure of CO2 sequestration, (2) the issuing of the necessary production licences of the project and (3) the finalisation of the necessary environmental assessments and approvals. On the first of these, I have today written to the WA Premier confirming the Commonwealth's agreement to share the long-term liability for the CO2 sequestered under the Barrow Island site. In relation to the production licences, I am advised that the Gorgon joint venture partners lodged an application for these licences with the Minister for Resources and Energy on Tuesday, as I understand it. Furthermore, on the question of the environmental proposals, that is what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and his WA state colleague have been asked to work on and they are continuing to do so diligently. It is important that these processes are attended to with all thoroughness, as those opposite will recall from their previous engagement in environmental assessment processes. A referral under the EPBC act was lodged by Chevron in April 2008 and the environment minister and his officers have been working closely with the WA government since that time.The interjection went to the roles of government. There will be three sets of regulatory roles, the first of which involves an act of indemnification that is actually unprecedented in the country. Therefore, the decision taken conjointly by this government and the WA Liberal government to indemnify the project against CO2 sequestration liabilities long term has in fact been one of those factors which has underpinned this decision. This is what the government has embarked upon in its support of these resource projects. As I indicated to the House yesterday and the day before, there are other LNG projects alive not only in Western Australia but also in Queensland as well as off the Northern Territory. The government will continue to work positively, proactively and constructively with each of these major companies because it is all about long-term development of Australia's infrastructure and long-term development of Australia's jobs.These development projects also dovetail with the government's long-term strategy of nation building for recovery and nation building for the future - nation building for the future and what must be a building decade for Australia, a building decade which involves not just the investment and public infrastructure - the roads, the rail, the ports that we need for the future as well as the high speed broadband - but also, in conjunction with our partners in the private sector, the long-term rollout of private sector infrastructure; hence, why we have developed Infrastructure Australia and hence its role in working out long-term plans for the proper provision of public infrastructure in Australia necessary for long-term productivity growth and, equally, to learn from the lessons from the past through the development of Skills Australia to work out the long-term skills needs which this economy will need, particularly given the tens of thousands of jobs which will emerge from these resource projects over time. We should be mindful of the fact that inadequate planning in this respect in the past led to excessive inflationary pressures through a failure to plan for long-term infrastructure and skills needs in the economy. That is the howling lesson from the end of the nineties through until the middle of the first decade of this century.We must learn by that. That is why the government is committed to a building decade ahead. That is why we intend to get on with the business of partnering with the private sector in advancing the Australian national economic interest. I would suggest to those opposite that they get with a national interest argument here, back the government and back the private sector in getting on with the business of building Australia's economic recovery for our long-term future.</DOC>

 - This is yet another example of those opposite being so desperate that they have to conduct and misrepresent the Treasury secretary, which is what they have done. The Treasury secretary gave a speech yesterday. He said all options are on the table. He is producing a report independently of the government. We will debate it in a mature way, irrespective of how divisive those opposite want to get. I have absolutely no intention of pre-empting the Henry report. Those opposite are just flipping and flopping all over the place, because we have had the shadow Treasurer say he supports the Henry review and we have had the Leader of the Opposition come in the House today and describe it as a smokescreen. Which one is it? Do you support it or not? -  - What we have is another example of a split on that side of the House - a split between the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition. What a rabble they are! The only things that bind them together are hatred and fear. They have proved their lack of judgment time and time again. - The shadow Treasurer was very sloppy when he made that statement -  - He was very sloppy yet again, because he went out and said he supported the Henry review. He was encouraged by it. We now have the tactics in this House this week. He has obviously been rolled. There were something like eight question times when there was not a question from the shadow Treasurer to me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck, a Western Australian who is proud of the announcements this week on achieving long-term export opportunities for Australia to the tune of $75 billion. The first ever long-term LNG supply contract with India was achieved on Monday of last week, and a $50 billion long-term LNG supply contract with PetroChina was achieved earlier this week. These contracts make a very strong statement that Australia is open for investment and, importantly, a very strong statement to the Asia-Pacific region that we are committed to developing our mineral and energy resources so as to not only maximise jobs and wealth in Australia but also meet the emerging needs of countries such as China and India.Let us deal with the recent history of the LNG industry and its potential in the very near future. In 2008-09, Australian LNG generated almost $10 billion in export earnings. That is nearly three times the value of LNG exports only three years ago. Today we have 20 million tonnes per year of production capacity on the North West Shelf in Western Australia and in Darwin. That LNG services key markets such as Japan, China and Taiwan and, in the foreseeable future, India and other Asia-Pacific nations. Perhaps more importantly, on achieving the Gorgon investment decision, with the good progress on Pluto 1, which is close to production, we have the capacity to double our export opportunities to the tune of 40 million tonnes and, in doing so, double our export earnings.I am also pleased to report to the House that the government will continue to work with the governments of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland in close alliance with the petroleum companies, because the race is on with respect to a number of other major LNG projects. I refer to Ichthys and its potential for the northern part of Australia, principally Darwin; Pluto 2 and Pluto 3 and the announcements by Woodside yesterday; Sunrise and our relationship with the Timor-Leste government; Wheatstone; Prelude; Browse; Scarborough; and Gladstone, the new frontier on the east coast of Australia, where there is great interest in coal seam methane based LNG, a new export opportunity for Australia.For Australia, that is not just about doubling or even tripling our LNG export opportunities; it is also about potentially achieving investments to the tune of $100 billion over the next couple of years. That creates wealth for the private sector and export earnings for the government to improve on the requirement to properly service the Australian community in areas such as health, education and basic infrastructure. It also creates real jobs on the ground.We should not forget that LNG is regarded as clean energy in the transition to a low-emission global community. By way of information to the House, for every tonne of CO2 produced in Australia when LNG is made, nine tonnes are saved when it is used for power generation in China. That is why I was also involved in a number of key conferences in China this week, going not only to the Gorgon export opportunities but also to our capacity to fuel their economy as they return to high growth and, in doing so, assist the global community to return to what we all want sooner than later: better economic growth.I am pleased to report that in meetings with the China National Petroleum Corporation - better known as PetroChina - the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, CNOOC, and Chairman Zhang Ping of the National Development and Reform Commission they have been vitally focused on Australia's export opportunities - not only in LNG but also in the expansion of our uranium sector and, very importantly, our capacity to work with them on clean coal technology and also the renewables sector. From Australia's point of view, we are well placed not only to service the requirements of the Asia-Pacific region on LNG, with terrific export opportunities and jobs in Australia, but also to take forward the clean energy debate in a very close, cooperative way with our counterparts in places such as China, Korea, India and Japan.In conclusion, I simply say that the outcomes of negotiations over recent months, which will hopefully conclude in the finalisation of the necessary requirements for the Gorgon investment decision, are in Australia's national interest. I am pleased to say that the government has worked with Western Australia and the business sector so as to facilitate that investment sooner rather than later. Perhaps more importantly, I simply remind the House that there are a wealth of other LNG opportunities that will create further investment, wealth and jobs in Australia and in doing so will serve emerging economies such as China and India.</DOC>

 - The shadow Treasurer has a new-found interest in tax, and I can imagine why he is so embarrassed considering that some weeks ago he suggested that this year's tax cuts in the budget should have been cancelled. I think he would be fairly embarrassed about that performance. He is correct to identify that, in terms of the Henry review, we said we would not be looking at any change to the GST and tax-free super. We said that. Of course when the Australian ran a story on Saturday I made the government's view on capital gains tax on housing very clear. I made the point that we did not ask the review to look at it, that they were not going to recommend it and that we had not considered it. That is the point I made on Saturday, and I will say it again very clearly: we did not ask the review to look at it, they are not going to recommend it and we are not going to consider it. I went on to make the point that we were not going to be in the daily habit of ruling things in or ruling things out. But I have one suggestion for those opposite - I wonder whether they could get together enough energy, and whether they could get together enough unity, to put in a submission to the Henry review on tax.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Just before question time the government secured passage of its expanded renewable energy target legislation through both the Senate and this House. That delivers on the commitment that the Australian Labor Party made to the Australian people to guarantee that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply will be delivered by renewable sources by the year 2020. This is an extremely important achievement and it is one of the key institutional changes in the battle that the government is undertaking to deal with climate change. The passage of the legislation will help unlock investment in renewable energy generation and of course in jobs associated with those industries in areas like solar and wind power amongst others.It is important for the House to understand that, even with the expanded renewable target renewable energy target in place, Australia's emissions will continue to rise without the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Projections show that without the CPRS emissions will be 20 per cent higher in 2020 than they were in the year 2000. That is why we need the CPRS legislation to be carried by the Senate and by this place. It is the principal mechanism by which we will go ahead to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country and play a constructive role in international negotiations over climate change.The opposition has attempted to present itself as 'greening up' this week by supporting the government's renewable energy target legislation, which is important. But of course it retains a thoroughly incoherent position on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme - and we know why they are so incoherent on this issue; there are still problems with climate change sceptics. They are hopelessly divided. The evidence that we saw yesterday in the House during question time was perfectly graphic on this issue. But the incoherence goes to the extent that, after spending all of last week and some time before arguing for the decoupling of the renewable energy legislation from the CPRS, the coalition has now agreed to amendments - which have enabled the passage of the renewable energy legislation - that provide a direct relationship between the renewable energy legislation and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.Let there be no mistake about it: after arguing for that decoupling, the renewable energy legislation provides for assistance or relief from the renewable energy target for industries in the emissions-intensive trade-exposed category on the same basis as the CPRS. That was the government's position in the first place. It is an acceptance of reality by the coalition at last on that issue - but not only that. The coalition has also agreed in the amendments to look at industries potentially affected by the renewable energy legislation on the basis that it will open up assistance under the Climate Change Action Fund - a fund, of course, which we funded by the establishment of the emissions trading scheme. So, firstly having argued to decouple everything, this is a double recouple. There is a direct relationship between both pieces of legislation.There appears to be some confusion on the other side about this issue, and I refer to some comments reported in the Australian yesterday from Senator Boswell, and this is in view of the fact that we need the CPRS to go through to address climate change. Senator Boswell said the following:_ our support for the renewable energy target in no way weakens our stand against the emissions trading scheme.It remains very, very doubtful whether we could ever vote for an ETS.The government has news for Senator Boswell, the National Party and the Western Australian Liberals. The agreement on the renewable energy legislation makes the case for the CPRS even more compelling - absolutely, fundamentally important. The time for vague principles, for reports from Frontier Economics and other consultants, for seeing the parade of sceptics on the other side of politics and for all of that is over. It is critical to have the CPRS legislation pass through this parliament and it is critical for the coalition to stand up in the national interest. They are behaving like a rabble on this issue. It is time to come forward with the specific amendments that the government can deal with to secure passage of the CPRS. Stand up for what is right.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question about tax. I also have now the statement he made to the House on 11 August this year. He said this:We look forward to the tax and welfare reform initiative of the Henry review. We look forward to seeing that.Back then, only a few weeks ago, he was a full supporter of the Henry process. Today the Leader of the Opposition comes into the House and calls it a smokescreen - very sloppy, Joe, very sloppy. What it shows is just how divided -  - It just shows how divided they are. - Certainly. I do withdraw, but it was very sloppy of the shadow Treasurer to quote the IMF paper in the way that he just did in this House because the IMF paper is about tax policy. It does relate to housing policy but it is all about tax deductibility for home mortgage interest repayments. It is principally about that and its impact in a number of other countries around the globe, and it is not specifically directed to this country. So it is just another example of the lack of judgment and the sloppiness of the shadow Treasurer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The question goes to the rigour and the sanctity of Australia's longstanding immigration procedures and processes. When people want to visit Australia - non-Australian citizens - they of course apply for a visa of some description. There are a range of assessments that are done in the course of that. For example, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship make assessments in respect of character. Our security organisations make assessments in respect of security. And from time to time under our arrangements it is open for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to make assessments with respect to foreign policy matters and foreign policy implications. Ultimately, as a result of that law, that practice and our longstanding procedures, from time to time it falls to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make a judgment as to whether the issuing of a visa would be appropriate or not as the case may be.This, of course, is precisely the process which I followed in the recent issuing of a visa to the Uygur leader Rebiya Kadeer - a matter of some controversy and a matter of remarks in the chamber this week. I have detailed to the House that prior to the issuing of the visa, and prior to my decision to not disturb our longstanding arrangements and to not disturb the normal processes of the issuing of a visa to her, I received representations, and Australia received representations, from the Chinese authorities at pretty much every level, including from my own counterpart. The representation from China was that this would not be something which China would welcome, and China asserted that Rebiya Kadeer was a terrorist. After exhaustive assessment, I came to the conclusion that I should not disturb the visa arrangements and the visa was granted. As I said to the House earlier this week, China responded to that by indicating it was most unhappy, and I have detailed to the House a number of measures which China has taken in response to that, which of course Australia regrets.The reason why we issued a visa and the reason why we did not disturb that is that we have values and virtues of long standing. We understand, respect and recognise freedom of speech. We value the capacity of someone to come to our country and say things even if we do not agree with them, and a range of things which Ms Kadeer said, including arguing that the western provinces should be under separate autonomy, is not something that the Australian government agrees with. We have a longstanding position to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the western provinces so far as China is concerned and, as I have indicated to the Chinese authorities, just because someone comes here does not mean that Australia agrees with them. But it is part of our system - our values and virtues - that people have the right to exercise a view.Yesterday in the House, in response to a question, I said to the shadow minister for foreign affairs, and the Leader of the Opposition as well, that I was a bit unclear as to what the Liberal Party's position on the issuing of the visa to Rebiya Kadeer was. I said I was just a bit unsure as to whether they supported it or opposed it. That was in part confirmed by the press release which the shadow minister put out yesterday, 19 August, and I quote:'Most recently, the Rudd Government failed to work constructively with China regarding the visit to Australia of Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer.'I said to myself, 'Work constructively? I am not quite sure what that means. I listened to the representations of the Chinese authorities. I made a decision. And before that decision was made public, as I indicated to the House, I let the Chinese authorities know.' So I was a bit unsure as to what working constructively meant. Maybe this meant that the Liberal Party did not agree with the government's decision and the visa should have been refused? I was much edified this morning when I saw the transcript from the shadow minister's doorstop at Parliament House today, 20 August. In commenting on the China-Australia relationship, she said, 'There was the bungling of the handling of the visa to the Uygur leader.' When you decide as a nation state to issue a visa you do one of two things: you either grant it or you refuse it. You either say yes or you say no. There is only one way you can bungle the issuing of a visa and that is if someone else forms the view that the visa should not have been issued. I am just assuming, because of what the shadow minister has said and because of her and the Leader of the Opposition's deafening silence on this issue until the last couple of days, that the Liberal Party does not and did not support the granting of the visa to Rebiya Kadeer. So the Liberal Party does not believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression.Maybe that is just reading too much into it? Maybe there is a simpler explanation: incompetence and trying to take craven domestic political advantage. Maybe it is just incompetence. Maybe it is speaking before you think. Or maybe it is doing what I said yesterday the Leader of the Opposition had done: broken the longstanding tradition of political parties on both sides of this House of a bipartisan approach to the Australia-China relationship? Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, when we were in opposition for 12 years we did not seek to take domestic political advantage of our relationship with China. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition and unlike the shadow minister, we do not take a naive, crass, simplistic, miscalculated, misjudged view of China. So it is there for all to see: the shadow minister on the doors today saying that, when the Australian government issued a visa to Rebiya Kadeer, that was a bungle. It was a bungle because, according to the Liberal Party, the visa should not have been granted. So either they do not believe in freedom of speech in accordance with our longstanding traditions or they are trying to take craven political advantage out of an important relationship.On the other hand, the government takes a long-term view of our relationship with China. In the last 24 hours we have seen the largest trade deal between Australia and China in our nation's history. We also have seen a range of difficulties associated with the relationship, crystallising with the issuing by the government of a visa to Rebiya Kadeer. And that was done because it was the right thing to do. If the Liberal Party had been in government at the time it is quite clear that the Liberal Party would not have issued that visa to Rebiya Kadeer. That would not have been in our nation's interest and it would not have been in the long-term interests of the relationship between Australia and China.</DOC>

 - Of course, I commence my answer over the voices of those who support Work Choices on the other side. We are involved in a reform, an award modernisation reform, that when the Liberal Party was in office it said it thought was a good reform too. Indeed, the member for Menzies and others used to come into this parliament each and every day and talk about the compliance burden from the awards system and say that the awards system needed to be modernised. As it turned out, the Liberal Party proved too incompetent to get that done and chose instead to go down the route of Work Choices, where of course the award did not mean anything because you could always have an Australian workplace agreement forced on you that would strip the award away. But this remains an important reform for employers, called for by employers for decades, and I direct the shadow minister to views expressed by organisations like the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry when they said:Workplace relations policy is too important for horse and buggy era approaches to persist._            _            __ many businesses are subject to overlapping, multiple sets of regulation _ within the one workplace.They went on to say that this situation creates:_ profound difficulties in identifying workplace rights and obligations.When did they say that? It was in 2005. Who is fixing it? This government is. It is fixing it through an award modernisation request that went to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is well into this two-year task and it is on a journey to reduce 2,400 outmoded state and federal awards and industrial instruments into 130 simple, modern awards - 2,400 complex, overlapping documents into 130 modern awards. That is an important reform and one I assume, from this question and the conduct of the Liberal Party, they are opposed to. They are opposed to lifting that burden from the shoulder of employers.As this award modernisation process has gone on there have been times when employers, and indeed unions, have raised with me concerns about the award modernisation process. I have said consistently to all groups, 'This is a job for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which overwhelmingly is doing it well.' But if I become persuaded that an individual example raises legitimate concerns about the public interest and legitimate concerns about the implications of my award modernisation request and the framework of that request then I will consider those requests and respond to them if necessary. I did that in the restaurant and hospitality sector. The shadow minister has woken up this morning and read the Australian newspaper and has obviously seen that we have been in dialogue with the horticultural industry. We will continue dialogue with industries as necessary.What I can promise to the shadow minister opposite and the Liberal Party generally is, whilst they sit there turning their faces against reform, turning their faces against the hard work necessary to achieve it, dreaming of the days of Work Choices and its reintroduction, over on this side of the House we are delivering the Fair Work regime complete for employers, with new, simple, modern awards.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question, which did much more than fill the void; it is a great question. It enables me to celebrate with him and with members on this side of the House the fact that we have received advice from the Ouse district school in his electorate that it is the first Tasmanian school to complete construction in the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, so that is great news. The school received $250,000 and now has a new multipurpose hall, of which they can be very proud.I am also pleased to say to the member for Lyons and to the members of this House that supported this important program, building the education infrastructure that we need for the future while supporting jobs today, that this project in the member for Lyons's electorate has supported local jobs. It has supported a total of approximately 35 on-site workers in the member for Lyons's electorate and approximately 12 of those were apprentices employed on the project engaged in carpentry, joinery, electrical work, mechanical services, plumbing, painting, plastering, glazing and concreting - and I think that is terrific news as well.I am asked about responses to the Building the Education Revolution program. For those who care about education - government members and Independent members in this House - it has been a response of enthusiasm. On the other side we see the opposition in disarray and acting as a complete rabble. They come to this parliament and criticise Building the Education Revolution. They go back home and they cannot wait to be associated with it. The shadow minister for education does not do much work on education. He gets on the internet occasionally and pulls up a photograph and then runs into this House and makes completely incorrect claims. Yesterday the member for Sturt came into this parliament and claimed, with props and all, that the Perseverance Primary School was going to receive $60,000 per student for their five students. Let me quote the words of the Australian newspaper on this. -  - Mr Speaker, it just goes to prove how smart Tasmanians are. On the question of the Australian newspaper I know that the shadow minister does not like to be revealed as a dud and a dissimulator, but this is what the Australian newspaper had to say today:_ a criticism by Mr Pyne about up to $300,000 being granted to a Victorian primary school with only five students backfired after it emerged the school had not sought most of the funding.            _         _         _Yesterday, the school's principal _ denied it had sought the funding.Of course, the shadow minister, who does no work and has no policy, was not the only one making false claims yesterday. We had the member for Macarthur making a claim about Douglas Park Primary School. He made a claim that there was a quote for $285,000 for a new library. Of course, that too is completely untrue. There was never an official quote for $285,000 for a new library - claim not true.But, whilst they are in here as a rabble with their false claims about Building the Education Revolution, there are some people who cannot wait to get back home and associate themselves with this project. My attention has been drawn to a very extensive multipage brochure called From Andrew to you. From Andrew to you actually takes us in the beginning - with the youth shots and all the rest of it - right back in time to when there was only black-and-white film, apparently - right back then. - We have the member for Goldstein in a hard hat and a vest - imagine that! Then, as we keep going through, there he is in a construction site. There he is, helping with a bit of construction. And what construction is he claiming to be involving himself in, and is it of importance to his electorate? There are pages and pages of lists, and what is it? It is this government's economic stimulus package and Building the Education Revolution - pages and pages and pages of it, right here in Goldstein. Of course, this was published somewhat earlier this year, when the member for Goldstein's electorate had received $4.5 million through Building the Education Revolution. One can only imagine the width of the next instalment, when he records the $64 million that his electorate currently has under Building the Education Revolution. The poor old voters in Goldstein will not even be able to lift it! The opposition are a rabble with no unity, no discipline, no policy and no ideas, and the only thing they have to sell in their electorates is associating themselves with government programs, and here is the proof.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, as we know just how important it is to deliver housing to Aboriginal people, particularly those in remote parts of Australia. Just to make it very clear, over the last 18 months in the Northern Territory, in fact, 90 houses have been built. But I would also highlight -  - The critical issue, of course, is how many houses have been built, and I have just indicated to the member how many have been built. But, that said, I do want to address the critical issue that he raises, because one of the things that this side of the parliament is very -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The member does refer to a major program that this government is committed to delivering on. We have announced that 750 new houses will be built in remote parts of the Northern Territory. It is a five-year program. There are 230 rebuilds that will be done. There will be 2,500 refurbishments of houses. This is the largest program of rebuilding and new housing development ever embarked on in the Northern Territory.It is also part of a major commitment by this government to reform. We understand that the old ways of delivering housing in remote parts of Australia have failed Aboriginal people terribly. What we see in every part of remote Australia is terrible overcrowding, and we know that this has to be addressed. This government has decided that we will invest, over the next 10 years, $5.5 billion in housing for Indigenous people in remote parts of Australia. It is a very large program.We have also decided that we will make sure that we address some of the failings of the past. We are insisting on major reforms. We are insisting on secure tenure. Leases will be negotiated and agreed before we embark on building houses for Aboriginal people in remote parts of Australia. This has never been done before. We are also insisting on proper tenancy management. We want to make sure that there is a very clear line of sight and responsibility so that it is clear who is responsible in the future for the maintenance of houses that we build. That has never been done before. We are also making sure that rent is paid and that tenants have to look after their homes. This sort of responsible tenancy management has never been clear before. Under this program, it will be.</DOC>

 - I would particularly like to thank the member for Ballarat for her question. I know just how concerned she is about the impact of this decision on the University of Ballarat in particular, just as the member for Macquarie is particularly concerned about the impacts that the visiting students from Charles Sturt University have told us about today in the House - because we on this side know that the decision of the Senate is going to have a particularly devastating impact on regional campuses and regional universities. But the thing that I would like to point out today is that it is not just we who realise this. Though they have failed to act and once again have toed the Liberal Party line, the National Party themselves know exactly how devastating this is going to be for regional universities.As I outlined yesterday, Senator Joyce said as recently as November last year that VSU has been a fiasco for regional universities. It is interesting that he also said in 2005 that he believed that universities:_ should have the right to raise a fee to support facilities intrinsically part of a university.But today I can tell you that Senator Joyce is not on his own on this one; he is joined by his colleagues in the National Party. Just this morning another National, Senator Williams, said on ABC New England radio: 'In the Nationals we support in principle a levy being placed on students.' Well, this is one of those occasions when supporting something in principle does not actually amount to anything. It is standing in this place and voting for it which will deliver for regional students. But once again they choose to talk the talk when they are on the radio and when they are talking to regional Australians but come into this chamber and betray them. Now they have to face the consequences of that, because there are almost 150,000 students who attend regional universities and campuses and it is those students who will be paying the price for the National Party's cowardice.I would like to draw attention to a couple of those students. One wrote to me last night - Billy, who studies at James Cook University, in the member for Leichardt's electorate. -  - You might want to listen to this one. Billy said,'VSU has smashed my campus. We lost our welfare and academic help on campus and it was not able to support me and the other 3,500 students on campus. When we needed help we had to at some stages call or webcam Townsville just to receive some counselling.' Perhaps the National Party would like to stand up in this place and explain exactly why they do not think that regional students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time, deserve face-to-face counselling - but the National Party do not think that is important. Perhaps they can stop pretending to care for regional students who are moving away from home to commence their studies and listen to the likes of Marshall, who moved from the small town of Clonbinane in Victoria to study at Victoria University. I will tell you what Marshall said to me. He said,'Moving to the city from a rural area was honestly uncomfortable. To move from a place where everybody knows everyone by name to a place where you are recognised as a number was a very sobering experience for me. Coming to university, I was under the impression that there would be clubs for every interest, whether they be debating, music, theatre or sport. However, sadly, these programs all had to be cancelled.'But it is not just the students who are suffering. We know that there will be a decline in jobs in regional Australia as a result of this. The thing is that at least the Liberal Party do not pretend to care. The National Party stand in this place, pretend that they care about regional students and, when we give them the chance to vote to prove it to all of Australia, they cowardly follow the Liberal Party line. If you would like one further demonstration of just how it is that the National Party have been using politics instead of policy in their decision making -  -  - It is all right, Mr Speaker. I can deliver one more example of this if they want it so much. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. In a great example of the inspired policy-making process that the Liberal Party follow, I would like to draw to the attention of the House some quotes from Senator Joyce. When he talked about just how he was going to make this decision, which is so crucial to regional Australia, he said, as is quoted in the Australian:I still believe that university is more than just the academic, it's the development of the person as a whole, but this issue is now secondary to the state election in Queensland _While the Queensland election is on, I'll have to fall into line _ but (if the vote comes after the election) it's a different kettle of fish.Sadly, it is not a different kettle of fish, because the National Party are still just meekly falling into line with the Liberal Party, where we on this side of the House will continue to deliver for regional universities, for regional students and for our higher education sector.</DOC>

 - Yes, Mr Speaker, I can inform the shadow minister and the House that we certainly do. As the shadow minister is aware, this is a measure that was announced in last year's budget. We have been negotiating for a period of time and we announced publicly that the introduction of the measure from 1 July would be delayed to 1 September. We certainly do intend to delay that further and we will provide the details in due course. - I think the shadow minister would understand that this is a very complex measure. We believe that -  - If the shadow minister wants to have a serious answer to what is a serious question, I can tell him that the measure has not been implemented; it is quite wrong for him to suggest that patients have suffered in any way. There have been a lot of negotiations. I might just give members of the House an example of one of the issues that is being negotiated. One of the issues that is being negotiated is the cost of Herceptin. Many of you on all sides of the House would know that it is a very expensive drug and a very important treatment for breast cancer sufferers. In Australia, the pharmaceutical company Roche provides the vial in only one size. In other countries, like Japan, it is provided in a range of different sizes, which means that the wastage is less. We have other pharmaceutical examples where the production process allows for some waste, and there are many other parts of the procedure where we believe that there is an extraordinary amount of wastage of highly expensive drugs funded by taxpayers.We believe that it is in the interests of taxpayers to ensure that we get value for money and that expensive cancer drugs are not wasted. We intend to pursue the measure and we certainly will advise the House and the shadow minister in due course of the timing of that. It will be delayed, and we make no apologies about that; but, unlike those opposite, we believe that taxpayers' money should be spent wisely. There should not be an abuse of processes. It is important to make sure that the health dollar goes as far as it can. New drugs, like Avastin, would not have been listed on the PBS because they would not have met the cost-effective test by PBAC unless this measure was in place. If the shadow minister would show just a skerrick of responsibility, he might just like to think about the sorts of drugs he wants taken off the PBS because he does not support these types of measures.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for the question. The member for Dawson is very well engaged with the sugar industry in his electorate. There are very exciting times ahead for the sugar industry in Australia. Already we have seen record high sugar prices - 28-year highs. My department has advised me that the futures contracts have risen from less than 12c a pound in October last year to 22c a pounds now. With the passing of the RET legislation, we have a new opportunity for extra money to be going through to the sugar industry through co-generation.The Sugar Milling Council has looked to potential co-generation sites up and down the sugar coast, from Queensland down to northern New South Wales. In Far North Queensland, in the seats of Leichhardt and Kennedy, they believe that there is now a capacity for co-generation to provide service of electricity to the same capacity of 70 per cent of the households in that area. In the electorate of Dawson, through North Queensland, in Herbert and the Burdekin, there are three mills to be upgraded. In the Whitsunday hinterland and Mackay in the central region there are two mill upgrades. In the first of those, in the Burdekin, we are talking about more than 140,000 households being able to be serviced with their electricity supplies through use of the bagasse back into the grid. That is more than the requirements for the total region, as a result of the RET now having been passed. These benefits go all the way down to the southern areas where sugar is grown, into Hinkler and Wide Bay, through the Wide Bay-Burnett southern region, and into northern New South Wales and the electorate of Page. To be able to turn this from an immediate advantage into a long-term drive for investment in renewables, it is not enough to simply have the renewable energy target in place; we also need to have the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to be able to continue to drive long-term investment into renewables.To be able to deliver on this, we need to get the certainty which is only possible if the coalition resolves its differences. It was not long ago - just on a year ago - that the member for Higgins was quoted in the Australian as saying:In the Coalition agreement, there has never been a Liberal Party position and a National Party position _ If you are in coalition, you have a Coalition position.That was what the member for Higgins said last year. This morning, on the doors, the Leader of the Opposition was asked, 'Well, what if the Nationals vote differently to the Liberals?' Instead of acknowledging it as a fundamental break within the coalition, he said, 'That is less than ideal.' What for decades on decades has been a cornerstone of that group - being able to say that they could be a coalition, being able to say that they could be an alternative government - is, instead, now simply something that is just 'less than ideal'.In an article by Matthew Franklin in today's Australian, we read that the Nationals have found a strategic genius who has come up with the pathway back to recovery as a political party. - The new idea that was come up with today that the National Party member quoted to Matthew Franklin was: 'We have to start talking to regional Australia.' A brand new idea for the National Party: start talking to regional Australia! I suggest that, on the way through, they start listening to regional Australia as well. There is no damage that any of us in this place can cause to the coalition that comes close to what they have been inflicting on themselves. They have become a rabble that makes Mal Meninga's political career look strategic.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the question, another question on an issue that is affecting many people and concerning many people. One of the main reasons that so many families are particularly concerned is because of a lot of the speculation before the budget that items were going to be removed from the Medicare safety net or in fact were going to be means-tested. I can assure your constituents, along with all others, that neither of those things is correct. The government is not removing any item from the Medicare safety net and is not means-testing any item on the safety net. The steps that are proposed from the budget measure are to limit the exorbitant fees that can be charged and are being charged by some IVF practitioners - not all of them but some.The answer to your question, to be honest, rests entirely on the providers of the services. Those who are charging an average fee for a typical cycle of $6,000 a year will have no increased expenses at all. I know because we have had very many representations from parents but also from providers to say that they do charge those fees and that they understand that we are taking a sensible move because there are some excessive fees, frankly, being charged by some providers who know that there are many families who are very desperate to be parents and quite rightly should be supported by the government, but that 78c in every dollar should not go into the pockets of highly paid health professionals preying on parents who are desperate to have children. People who are charged average fees will not be worse off. I have said that on the record before and I continue to say that. It is in the hands of those specialists, who can still make very good incomes, to make a decision whether they want patients to pay for this or whether they are prepared to moderate their fees. This is a sensible measure and the opposition should support it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. Indeed, responding to climate change was a theme at this year's Australian Council of Local Government meeting held in the last week of June in conjunction with the parliamentary sitting here. Local government is working constructively with the national government to deal with the impacts of climate change. Many of the local community infrastructure projects that are rolling out around the country are creating jobs as well as building sustainability at the local level.I am asked about the importance of a united national response to climate change. I have to report, Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, that a united response has been lacking. We have seen from those opposite chaos and division - not a single amendment proposed to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation because they could not agree between themselves. Those opposite have all week once again behaved like an absolute rabble. It is the climate change sceptics and the deniers who are controlling their party room, and the Leader of the Opposition has a very difficult task to bring his party, let alone the Nationals, into line so that we can truly have a united national position on climate change.We have seen some of the veterans of this House, the dinosaurs, in their position of climate change denial. I have to report that they are also coming up the ranks through local government. The leader of the Liberal Party in the inner west of Sydney is a local councillor, Nick Adams. He provides an insight into what the rank and file view in the Liberal Party is when it comes to climate change. Just a few days ago he declared climate change to be a crock. He said:The whole thing is a hoax - it's a swindle.He went on to say:Even if every single Australian simultaneously broke wind, it would have zero impact on the environment.He is a sophisticate, this bloke. He went on to say, in a criticism of people in his own party:Anyone that supports the ETS is not a true patriot.There was more:Anyone that supports the ETS does not want jobs for all Australians. They are traitors.That is the position coming up from the ranks of the Liberal Party that the Leader of the Opposition has to deal with.Yesterday we saw the extraordinary position whereby we had a walkout at question time over a deal that they said they support. The extraordinary thing was not the walkout - they walked back about three minutes later. It was like they had a collective dunny break and came back in. They came back into the chamber because they did not know why they had left in the first place. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. We on this side of the House did not ask people to leave yesterday. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition was incapable of showing any leadership whatsoever. We all saw the member for O'Connor waving his finger, giving instructions to the Leader of the Opposition. What an absolute rabble. But the big problem is that it is a problem for the nation. It is a problem for them, but it is holding back reform. - To be fair, the Manager of Opposition Business has ruled out a leadership challenge between now and the next election.</DOC>

 - The government has put in place a savings strategy which is designed to ensure that the budget gets back to surplus by 2015-16 in the wake of the massive loss of revenue that has arrived as a result of the global financial crisis and the global recession. Mr Speaker, as you would recall, that is approximately $210 billion. But the government did put in place a number of savings initiatives in the last budget which were all designed to, over the medium term, improve the fiscal situation for, amongst other reasons, the purpose of avoiding having the fiscal position put upward pressure on interest rates. Unfortunately some of these initiatives have been blocked by the opposition in the Senate. I find it rather extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition would stand up here and ask for details of the government's fiscal strategy to ensure that we have savings and put downward pressure on interest rates when one of the major obstacles to achieving these ambitions is the opposition itself. With respect to the reform of the private health insurance rebate, for example, and other health initiatives that are designed to reduce the total spend on these areas in order to improve the fiscal position, it is the opposition, in the Senate, that is blocking these savings. It is characteristically part of the opposition's stance that, on the one hand, it says that it will deliver a smaller deficit -  - I hate to enlighten the Leader of the Opposition but the private health insurance rebate is in fact a spending item, and that is the example I cited that is being blocked in the Senate because the Leader of the Opposition wants to keep his private health insurance rebate so that ordinary working people who pay the taxes to finance his private health insurance subsidy will keep paying those taxes. The opposition is totally, massively, chronically confused on fiscal policy. It says it would have a lower deficit, that it would have lower debt, yet it makes promises of more spending, it blocks the government's savings initiatives in the Senate and it has yet to put forward a single savings initiative of its own.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Recently the G20, at finance minister level, has been meeting in London to discuss measures taken so far but also what measures may further need to be taken in our response to what has been the worst economic crisis the world has confronted in three-quarters of a century. Here in Australia, I would like to inform the House, the ANZ job advertisement series shows that the number of job ads grew 4.1 per cent in August. They actually grew by 4.1 per cent in August. This is the first monthly increase since April 2008 - that is nearly 18 months - and the strongest monthly growth since September 2007. The acting chief economist at Westpac says:Australian economic activity has been remarkably resilient in recent months, particularly in some of our largest employing industries, such as retail trade, health services, government and construction.Of course these are the industry areas where so much of the government stimulus strategy has been focused, and that is why it is important to see that these measures are having an effect. These figures on job advertisements follow what has been a positive result in the national accounts data released last week. Last week's GDP result indicated that the government's early and decisive action to cushion the economy from the worst impacts of the global recession is working. The Australian economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the June quarter and 0.6 per cent across the year. The results are that Australia has the strongest growth, over the past year, of any of the world's 33 advanced economies; secondly, Australia is the only advanced economy to have reported positive growth over the last year; and, thirdly, Australia has the fastest growth, the lowest debt, the lowest deficit and the second lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies.Domestic and international figures underscore the absolute importance of ensuring that we continue to stay the course with this strategy. Treasury advises that, in the absence of the government's stimulus strategy delivered through our nation building for recovery plan, GDP in Australia would have fallen 0.3 per cent in the last quarter, the economy would be recording its third consecutive quarter of negative growth and, on top of that, the Australian economy would have contracted 1.3 per cent over the past year. In other words, had the strategy advocated by those opposite been adopted, Australia right now would be in the depths of recession and with unemployment going through the roof. Let us be absolutely clear about this: had the strategy advocated by those opposite been embraced, we would right now be in the depths of recession and with unemployment going through the roof.Can I say to those opposite that the Australian economy, however, is not out of the woods yet. If you look carefully at the job ads data released in the ANZ series today, there is another important figure there which is worthy of examination, and that is that job ads are still down 48.1 per cent over the year. Furthermore, if you look at the recent data on trade, you will see that our export earnings fell by almost $11 billion in the June quarter, the largest fall on record, and this has been a consequence of the unwinding of the commodity boom. Also, company profits fell by 9.4 per cent over the past year, the largest fall since 1961. So, if you look carefully at the national accounts, if you look at trade data, if you look across the other indicators, there are strengths - largely but not exclusively in response to what the government has been doing by way of stimulus - but also weaknesses, which are reflecting the downturn in global economic activity which has been underway for some time.For those opposite who believe that we may be out of the woods already, I draw their attention to the unemployment data which has come out of the United States overnight which says that unemployment in the US is now 9.7 per cent, and in Canada it is 8.7 per cent. These are very large numbers indeed. This underlines the absolute importance of ensuring that we prosecute a strategy which does not pull the rug from underneath the economic recovery. The Chief Economist of the Commonwealth Bank, Michael Blythe, says:The Australian economy will continue to benefit from economic policy stimulus. We are not there yet, but that stimulus should get us through to the point where a self-sustaining recovery takes over.Furthermore, in terms of the absolute importance of economic stimulus, I draw the attention of those opposite to what was concluded by the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors over the course of the weekend in London. They said, in their communique:We will continue to implement decisively our necessary financial support measures and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, consistent with price stability and long-term fiscal sustainability, until recovery is secured.It is worth reflecting on that. You have the finance ministers and the central bank governors from the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Canada, the United States, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, India and other countries, of course. None of these central bank governors or finance ministers, according to those opposite, has a clue what they are talking about. Only those opposite, it seems, have received wisdom from on high - this is the only course of action, they say - that it is time to pull the rug from under the recovery by pulling the rug from under the government's stimulus strategy being delivered through the nation building for recovery plan.I also draw the attention of those opposite to the very important intervention by the Treasurer of Western Australia, Troy Buswell. What did Troy have to say? Troy had a few things to say. Troy was asked:Back on the economy: should the Commonwealth pull back on its stimulus strategy?Troy said:No. I think that would be far too premature, to argue for the Commonwealth to pull back on a stimulatory package. There is still much uncertainty.There you have the finance ministers and the central bank governors of the 20 largest economies in the world, you have major public economists and you have our industry organisation leaders urging the government to continue in its course of action. You have Troy Buswell, the Liberal Treasurer of Western Australia out there saying the same. There is but one voice in the wilderness saying that this is all wrong, and that voice is that of the Leader of the Opposition, who has argued consistently, 'You should never have brought in stimulus in the first place,' presumably because their strategy -  -  - Oh! Now they want to hop onto the stimulus bandwagon! That brings us back to that core mathematical question: 'How much stimulus do you want and how much do you not want?' Last time I looked, you wanted 95 per cent, maybe 90 per cent - it depends how the factional deliberations are going within the Liberal Party on a given day. But, if we had followed the advice of those opposite, which was not to engage in early, decisive, strong action through stimulus, the result would have been that we would now be in the depths of recession with unemployment going through the roof. But, having got that so fundamentally wrong, what do they now say? 'Pull the rug from under recovery and pull back on the stimulus' - which all these other institutions are urging this government to continue with.I say to those opposite, whether it is on the economy or other matters of public policy, what we see is a Liberal Party increasingly opportunist, out of touch, short term and - I have got to say - on the question of economic strategy, fundamentally lacking in judgment. It is that lack of judgment that we have seen so conspicuously on the part of the Leader of the Opposition on so many matters in recent times. Let us get on with the business of an Australian economic recovery.</DOC>

 - To begin with, I cannot confirm the assertion that concluded the member for North Sydney's question. In fact, the circumstances are such that it is very important for the stimulus to remain in place. Had that stimulus not been there, the June quarter account figures that have just been released would have been negative. The Treasury advice is that, had the government stimulus not been in place, then the Australian economy would have gone backwards by minus 0.3 per cent in the preceding quarter.The implication in the member for North Sydney's question is at odds with what in fact the Reserve Bank governor has said. The Reserve Bank governor has simply said that, because the current interest rate settings are at 'emergency levels', it is reasonable to anticipate that at some point in the future that would cease to be the case. The member for Sydney is spicing up the Reserve Bank governor's comments in ways that are not intended and therefore the whole implication in his question is completely wrong. The government do have a strong fiscal position, which is designed to get the budget back into surplus, which is built around savings in order to ensure that the government take strong action to get value for money from the taxpayers' dollar that is spent on behalf of the Australian people.But I would remind the member for North Sydney that the government, of which he was a part, the cabinet of which he was a part, in its last four budgets managed to come up with a grand total of savings of roughly zero. So when we came to office we had a pretty big task of cleaning up government spending. We had a very big task of running the ruler over government programs and over government administration. And we have put in place, through a lot of reductions in spending on government processes alone - not on programs but just on the business of government alone - savings that will yield benefits of about $5 billion over a five-year period. That is not to mention major changes to entitlements, including major decisions that were put in place in the budget this year, some of which are being blocked by the opposition in the Senate.I would conclude by suggesting that if, as they pretend, at least today - tomorrow's message might be the opposite - the opposition are serious about ensuring that the Australian government has a fiscal position that is as strong as possible and that is putting zero upward pressure on interest rates they will stop blocking government savings initiatives in the Senate. That is precisely what they are doing. They are continuing to block those savings initiatives in the Senate. If they are serious about a strong fiscal position and about maximising the downward pressure on interest rates they will get out of the road and pass those budget measures in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know that she, both in her electorate and in the state of South Australia, is very concerned to see jobs supported during the difficult days of the global recession. Of course, the world is confronting the harshest global economic conditions since World War II, and Australia is weathering this storm. We know that current economic conditions around the globe are impacting on the Australian economy and on jobs. Nevertheless, there are some encouraging signs in some recent jobs figures, some released today and some released over the past few weeks. In the ANZ job advertisement series, released today, we saw that the total number of jobs advertised in major metropolitan newspapers and on the internet rose by 4.1 per cent. In the Oliver Job Index, reported in the media today, there was a rise of 2.5 per cent, which was the largest jump since May 2008.The SEEK Employment Index rose by 4.8 per cent over the month of July. The Skilled Vacancies Index, containing figures collected by my department, rose by one per cent over August 2009, and the leading indicator of employment has risen for the second consecutive month in August, after falling for 18 consecutive months. Notwithstanding these figures, later this week we will see the next figures in the ABS monthly series on unemployment and, as the government forecast predicts, we do anticipate that unemployment will continue to rise. We know that this is occurring in circumstances where the IMF is still forecasting the global economy to contract by 1.4 per cent this year, and we know that unemployment in the US has hit 9.7 per cent. What this means of course is that, as the G20 finance ministers reflected on the weekend, as representatives of the world's leading economies, we are not yet out of the woods. Business investment remains weak in Australia, our export income has been cut and of course we have to engage in economic stimulus which is timely and targeted and that is exactly what the government is doing -  -  - notwithstanding the jeering of those opposite, who care so little about the jobs of their fellow Australians. This economic stimulus will support over 200,000 jobs. This economic stimulus is not only supporting jobs today whilst we build the infrastructure that we need for tomorrow; it is supporting training efforts today. In that regard I would direct members' attention to the fact that in the Building the Education Revolution program there is a requirement that at least 10 per cent of the total contract hours should be undertaken by apprentices, trainees and those seeking to upskill. I would have thought that that would have been endorsed as good news by anyone who cares about the next generation of skilled tradespeople. This is against a background where the National Centre for Vocational Education Research has told us, in its recent statistics, that the number of Australians who started a trade apprenticeship fell in the March quarter, by 22 per cent, compared to the same time last year. These figures prove that we are not out of the woods, that we need to support employment in our economy and that we need to support training efforts in our economy. Our economic stimulus package is doing just that, our Building the Education Revolution package is doing just that and we will continue to deliver them, notwithstanding the jeering and criticism of those opposite, who care so little about the jobs of Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Warringah for his question, and particularly for the opportunity that it gives me to inform the House about how many houses have been built in remote parts of the Northern Territory since the election. In fact, 102 houses have been built in remote Northern Territory communities since we were elected -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. One hundred and two houses. I might just compare that with how many houses were built under the previous government under the same program. In 2004-05 there were 94 houses built. In 2005-06 under the previous government there were 51 houses built -  - Of course, what Aboriginal people want to know is how many houses have been built since we came into government, and it is 102, compared to the number of houses that were built under the previous government, which was considerably less. - I do appreciate the opportunity to go through this in some detail. Like everybody in this House, I am concerned to make sure that we deliver increased numbers of houses to Aboriginal people in remote parts of the Northern Territory. -  - What we have recently done is conduct an important review of the SIHIP program -  - which has been put in place while those 102 houses have been built. What has been found as a result of that review is that, unlike the question from the shadow minister, we are able to deliver the housing numbers that we are committed to. We intend to deliver by 2013 750 new homes, 230 rebuilds and 2½ thousand refurbishments. Just compare that number of houses to what was built under the previous government. In 2005-06 under the previous government 51 houses were built. We have a major program underway and we intend to deliver on those targets. We have recognised that issues have arisen and challenges have arisen, which is why I have put in place this important review. The review has been conducted and made public, and the review has found that the program design that we have put in place is sound but that there has certainly been about a three-month delay in implementation, which of course I am very concerned about. Nevertheless, it makes it very clear that the program targets of 750 houses, 230 rebuilds and 2½ thousand refurbishments will be met.I have been very concerned in particular about the findings of this review in relation to administrative costs. I know there has been a lot of public comment about this issue. We are now working to reduce those administrative costs from 11.4 per cent to eight per cent, and that will be done. I have also decided that the Commonwealth will take a much more hands-on approach. This is a very unusual step, which has never been done by the previous government, to make sure that we deliver on the targets that we have set. Work has now started on Groote Eylandt and it is about to start in Nguiu.Most importantly, we have to recognise that the work is underway to refurbish houses and to rebuild houses that were previously not liveable. I am sure that the shadow minister has seen some of these houses, with kitchens that families could not cook in and bathrooms that children could not be bathed in. In Tennant Creek, for example, we have got many people working on these houses making sure that families will have a decent place to live in. We are putting Commonwealth officials into this program in an unusual step to make sure that it does deliver on the targets that we know are so important for Aboriginal people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. The June quarter national accounts that were published last week indicated that the Australian economy is the only major developed economy that grew over the course of the 2008-09 year, and that, in the previous quarter, the economy grew by 0.6 per cent and, indeed, over the year the economy grew by 0.6 per cent.Within the detail of the national accounts, you can see evidence that the government's stimulus strategy has been working. In particular, household consumption increased by 0.8 per cent over the course of the quarter, indicating that the cash payments that were put into the economy to stimulate economic activity had a significant effect. The business investment figure for the quarter increased by two per cent - equally indicating that the tax incentives put in place, specifically for small business but also for business generally, were having an effect, bringing forward business investment, bringing forward business expenditure, to help sustain the economy at a time when private activity has been generally retreating. Finally, you will also see that public investment increased by 0.8 per cent over the quarter - namely, that the infrastructure investment program of the government, as part of its wider stimulus strategy, has also been having an effect.The Treasury calculates that, without the government's stimulus strategy, Australia would have suffered three consecutive quarters of negative growth. That would mean technical recession - three consecutive quarters of negative growth - and that we would have had 0.3 per cent negative growth over the course of the recent quarter, not the 0.6 per cent positive growth that we have experienced. Australia now is the fastest-growing economy in the developed world, and we have the second-lowest unemployment. The government is focused on the short-term challenge of tackling the flow-on consequences of the global recession and the global financial crisis, but also is very much focused, in doing so, on the longer term productivity challenges facing its nation. That is why the bulk of its stimulus strategy is focused on investing in infrastructure, investing in improving our education systems  and investing in the long-term drivers of productivity.I would have to ask: just how much evidence does the opposition need in order for it to understand that the government's stimulus strategy is having a positive effect on the Australian economy - that it is working? They have consistently opposed this strategy. They have consistently voted against this strategy. They have consistently locked themselves into a foolish position. And they are now desperately groping around for any last little bit of political nitpicking they can throw at the stimulus strategy in order to justify their position.I note that the Leader of the Opposition, it was claimed a week or so ago in the media, was trawling around 10 years ago to become Labor shadow finance minister. This was of some concern to me because I was shadow finance minister at the time. I did not know he was stalking me! I am not quite sure whether it would have had a positive impact on the fiscal position of the opposition, but we live in hope. And there is still time. We have had three shadow finance ministers over the past 18 or 20 months and, given the leadership turmoil on the other side, it is still possible that the member for Wentworth could end up as shadow finance minister before this parliament is out. But I sincerely hope that the opposition, irrespective of the position that the member for Wentworth and Leader of the Opposition currently holds, rethink their position on the government's stimulus strategy, because these national accounts demonstrate that, against very powerful negative forces from the international economy, we are succeeding in pushing back and keeping the Australian economy growing positively, sustaining jobs and employment, at a time when they are collapsing throughout the rest of the developed world.</DOC>

 - I do genuinely thank the shadow minister for his question, because it enables me to explain to the House some facts about this program which I believe the shadow minister either may not understand or may not be repeating accurately. The shadow minister is certainly right to say that the government has increased allocations to the Building the Education Revolution program by $1.5 billion. We promised the Australian people -  -  - We promised the Australian people we would deliver $42 billion worth of economic stimulus, and we are delivering $42 billion of economic stimulus. The Building the Education Revolution program required an additional allocation from that $42 billion because of two factors in our Primary Schools for the 21st Century program.Factor No. 1 was that at the time that this program was costed it was impossible for the government to have the actual 2009 enrolment statistics because it was before the commencement of the school year. The enrolment statistics matter because this is a program correlated to school size. So, as school sizes change and the number of schools changes, obviously financing in the program changes. Then, the second and overwhelmingly largest factor in terms of the costings was that when this program was announced the program costings were done on the basis that uptake was likely to be 90 per cent.An opposition member - What? Free money! - I hear the opposition jeer at that, and the opposition is obviously thinking to itself: 'Why would you model a percentage uptake of a universal entitlement program in schools? Why would you do that?' It really strikes me as passing strange that any member of the opposition would jeer about that, because when the opposition was in government it had the Investing in Our Schools Program and - you guessed it - it was modelled at an 80 per cent take-up rate. It was badged as a universal entitlement to schools and it was modelled at an 80 per cent take-up rate. - The shadow minister says - he is priceless; I am very fond of him - 'And there wasn't a blow-out.' Yes, there was a blow-out. There was a blow-out when your deputy leader was Minister for Education, Science and Training.Let me explain to you the nature of the blow-out. Having costed the program at 80 per cent, more schools wanted the money than the costing allowed. So what happened was that the then minister for education, currently Deputy Leader of the Opposition, went back for an additional $181 million. That is the 'blow-out', if this terminology is going to be used, in the cost of Investing in Our Schools - 18 per cent. It was a blow-out of 18 per cent, presided over by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition whilst the current Leader of the Opposition was a member of cabinet. I cannot recall whether the current shadow minister was in the ministry or trying to get into the ministry, but it was a blow-out of 18 per cent.Of course, percentage wise, this is a far greater cost variation than anything that has happened with Building the Education Revolution. The then minister for education, now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, had to go back to the budget and come back out with $181 million, whereas this is a reallocation within an envelope that we promised the Australian people - $42 billion. So it just amazes me that any member of the opposition would have been out criticising a costing assumption of a 90 per cent take-up for Primary Schools for the 21st Century when they sat on the government benches and put out a program with an 80 per cent take-up and a blow-out of 18 per cent and then had to fix it.Then, of course, on the question of fixing that blow-out, what did they do? They changed the guidelines to cut the entitlement to - you guessed it - government schools. Schools had been able to apply, government and non-government, for $150,000 and then, to manage the consequences of the 80 per cent take-up rate assumption, the former government changed the guidelines so government schools could only get $50,000 less as a maximum. - What they then did was cut the entitlement to government schools. In stark contrast, this is a government that said it would deliver $42 billion of stimulus to support jobs today whilst building the infrastructure for tomorrow. Within that $42 billion stimulus we have made an extra allocation to Primary Schools for the 21st Century because it is going gangbusters and more primary schools want to be involved in it than were originally costed for. We costed with a greater uptake assumption than that used by the previous government in its Investing in Our Schools Program and, unlike the previous government, we do not discriminate against government schools. We are supporting schools right around the nation so we can support jobs right around the nation. This is about jobs. It is about infrastructure for the future. It is a real pity that the current opposition, caught in this mire of hypocrisy, cannot see its way clear to just supporting the program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. It is good to get another question from this side of the House about infrastructure, because we have had none all year - not a single question on infrastructure - from the opposite side of the House. Indeed, 70 per cent of our economic stimulus is in nation-building infrastructure - in our roads, in our rail, in our ports, in our broadband and, of course, in our schools as well as in our housing. This is about supporting jobs today to boost our economic recovery to support the economy of tomorrow.As part of the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, we brought forward some $711 million to accelerate 14 road projects across the country. This is now flowing through in projects across the nation. Indeed, last Friday the member for Brand launched the construction of the Mandurah Entrance Road in Perth in Western Australia. This construction is supporting up to 200 jobs and is construction welcomed by the West Australian Minister for Transport, Simon O'Brien. It is not surprising that the West Australian Treasurer, when asked about whether the stimulus should be withdrawn, said last Thursday, 'I think that would be far too premature to argue for the Commonwealth to pull back on a stimulatory package. We see evidence of that here.' Indeed they do in Western Australia, as they do right around the country. Indeed, last Thursday I turned the first sod on section B, Cooroy to Curra, on the Bruce Highway as part of our N1.In rail, we have injected $1.2 billion to undertake 17 rail projects. Just nine months later, projects are underway right around the country. Work got underway so quickly that three of those projects have been completed - announced, people put to work and completed so as to improve productivity on those rail lines. But, of course, we are also delivering on community infrastructure. We are investing over $1 billion through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. Of that, some 400 projects have been completed already. Over 2,500 projects are underway.Are those who argue for the stimulus to be brought back saying that those 2,500 local community infrastructure projects in electorates right around the nation - theirs and ours regardless of political flavour - should be stopped halfway through? What are they saying when they say that these projects should be withdrawn? I note that the member for North Sydney has said that he will not go to the school infrastructure projects as part of the economic stimulus in his electorate because that would be hypocritical given that he voted against the package. That stands in stark contrast to the member for Wentworth and other members who are happy to turn up to these projects that they voted against. I look forward to seeing Malcolm this Friday, once again in the electorate of Wentworth, at a Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program announcement. Right around the country, with the exception of the member for North Sydney, their members on the ground in their own electorates are supporting the economic stimulus because they know that local communities want the jobs and the economic activity that that stimulus is bringing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. As the Deputy Prime Minister has explained, there are a number of factors involved in this situation, the first of which -  - Perhaps you will allow me to conclude the answer. The answer is that, firstly, the enrolment data that was available at the time the costing occurred was superseded by subsequent enrolment data which, of course, was not available at the time. The school census data for the current year was not available at the time, and that meant that there were significant changes in the overall profile for funding. Secondly, the assumption behind the take-up rate, the utilisation of maximum funding rate of 90 per cent, proved to be insufficient. The amount that had been taken up was significantly higher than the amount on which that was based. The advice from my department is directly in accord with what you just heard from the Deputy Prime Minister that the take-up rate was in fact higher than was initially anticipated and that there was a particular element with respect to the costing, namely, that the school census data on which the costing was based was subsequently superseded by more updated school census data, which meant that there were more students and higher numbers of students in different categories.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question and for his ongoing support for all those small businesses in and around the central area of Brisbane. He has been a long and trusted supporter of the small business community there. The national accounts released last week confirm that our fiscal stimulus strategy is working and that Australia is one of the very few developed countries that is not in recession. In fact, it is the only major developed country not in recession. We have now recorded two successive quarters of positive economic growth at a time when, overall, the rest of the developed world is in the deepest recession since the Great Depression.It was interesting to go through a bit of a breakdown of the national accounts figures because they reveal that private investment in plant and equipment was much stronger than the market had expected. Gross domestic product in the June quarter grew by 0.6 per cent but business expenditure on equipment, plant and machinery increased by 5.6 per cent. Compare that with the overall GDP growth of 0.6 per cent - a very strong result. There was a 5.6 per cent increase in investment in equipment, plant and machinery. It is fascinating because Treasury estimates suggest that that investment in equipment, plant and machinery would have contracted by around three per cent without the small business and general business tax break. That shows how important the stimulus has been and continues to be in supporting small business through these challenging economic times.It is clear that this strong result is testimony to the small business and general business tax break that was introduced by the Rudd government on 13 December last year, but yet again the opposition leader has shown poor judgment by claiming that small businesses would not take advantage of that tax break. That is what he said: that small business would not take advantage of the tax break. In fact, they have done so. Indeed, the Prime Minister -  - You said it many times. Indeed, you said, 'If you're a small business and you're short of cash, a tax break isn't much good to you.' That was one of the many references that you made. The fact is that these figures are very strong: a 5.6 per cent increase in investment in plant, equipment and machinery in the June quarter compared with an overall increase in GDP of just 0.6 per cent - but at least it had a positive number in front of it, whereas the rest of the world had a negative number in front of it, and most of the rest of the world is in recession.The Prime Minister extended the small business tax break until the end of this year, 31 December, and boosted the rate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. So small businesses, against the judgment of the opposition leader, are taking to this tax break with gusto. Yet the opposition leader is now demanding that the stimulus be withdrawn. He voted against the stimulus package in the first place, and now he wants it withdrawn. His policy is to pull the supports out of the Australian economy, destroying Australian jobs and Australian small businesses in the process. It is just another example of the opposition leader's poor judgment. The fact of the matter is this: withdrawing the stimulus would smash small business confidence and destroy tens of thousands of small businesses in this country.The Leader of the Opposition was asked yesterday to identify any credible source that supported his policy of withdrawing stimulus. He was incapable of naming one credible supporter of his policy of withdrawing stimulus. He is on his own. He is the Lone Ranger, Napoleon Solo, Robinson Crusoe and Dr Zachary Smith up there out on the outer edges of the Milky Way, lost in space, out there on his own. Ground control to Major Tom: you are out there on your own whizzing around the Milky Way, absolutely isolated. Ground control to Major Tom: do not destroy Australian businesses. That is what ground control is saying, Major Tom: do not destroy Australian small businesses. Get in and support our policy, because the Rudd government will continue to support Australian jobs, apprentices, tradies and small businesses in building the infrastructure of tomorrow.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question, and I presume that he is opposed to the 32 schools in his electorate benefiting from 104 projects and receiving more than $77 million of funds under Building the Education Revolution. I presume he is opposed to each and every dollar and each and every job supported by that expenditure. He must be, because he voted against it. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was making the very simple point to the member - and I would make it to all members in the House - that this is a program for all 9,500-odd schools around the country. It is a program that - The member for Bowman then left the chamber. - The simple point I was making is that this is a program benefiting 9,501 schools around the country with 24,426 individual projects. This is a program that rolls out correlated with school size but, as the guidelines have made clear throughout the life of the program, we work with education authorities, state and territory governments, the Catholic education authority and the education authority for independent schools so that we can respond to school needs. That has, of course, included money being moved from schools that do not need that resource to other schools. That has happened in circumstances where schools are going to be amalgamated, and obviously we want the new facilities to be there at the school that is going to be ongoing. We continue to work with school authorities on these questions, and we will continue to do so. -  - I say to the opposition members who call out during this debate that perhaps they might like to consider that the centrepiece of this program is support for jobs and school infrastructure today, during the days of the global recession, supporting tradespeople and apprentices around the country whilst delivering the biggest school modernisation program the country has ever seen, with more than 24,000 projects being delivered effectively over a two-year rollout period. I know that members opposite are embarrassed that they voted against jobs and assistance for local schools. I know that members opposite think that it is clever to come in here day after day -  - I know that members opposite feel that it is clever to come in here day after day raising allegations about this program and talking it down. Most of the material they have raised in question time has turned out to be factually inaccurate. This is a program to support local jobs and to build school infrastructure for the future. It is a program that most members sitting opposite cannot wait to associate themselves with the moment they are back in their electorates. But here in Canberra, of course, because they have voted against the program they cannot do that. The difficulty for the opposition is that very first decision. When they voted against this program they said no to jobs and no to school infrastructure and they will be judged on that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He always takes a particular interest in health issues. We all know in this parliament that Australia is one of the safest places in the world to give birth and that is an enviable record that we must, of course, protect. In June I was pleased to introduce into the parliament landmark legislation to implement our $120 million maternity services package, which will boost the role of the nation's nurses and midwives in providing high-quality health care and improving women's access to high-quality safe maternity care. Our reforms, as many in the House would know, are facilitating access to the MBS and the PBS by patients of nurse practitioners and appropriately qualified and experienced midwives. This is going to help remove barriers to the provision of care and improve access to services for the community. By making better use of our maternity services workforce, new arrangements are also expected to ensure greater access to maternity care for women closer to their homes. These bills are before the House right now and Australia's nurses and midwives know exactly where the Rudd government stands on this issue.But as yet we do not know where the Liberal Party stand on this issue. How could we possibly know where the Liberal Party stand on this issue? The member for Dickson, true to form, has done nothing but grandstand and posture on this issue. We have seen no statement of support, no arguments against - no reason for any support to be denied or granted to nurses and midwives from the opposition. So what I want to make sure the parliament and the public are aware of today is just what it is that the Liberal Party seem unable to decide on when it comes to backing our nurses and midwives, who have waited decades for this change. Just so we are clear, do the Liberal Party truly want to prevent better access to breastfeeding support for many thousands of women across the country? Do they really want to prevent patients of nurse practitioners from accessing a rebate for medicines that they can legally prescribe today? Do they want to prevent innovative ways of ensuring that some of the most vulnerable in our community, like those in aged-care facilities, get better access to health care when and where they need it?Any attempts by the Liberal Party to pretend that these bills take away rights are simply incorrect. The member for Dickson still seems to be very confused with the draft national registration and accreditation scheme legislation, which requires that all health professionals, including midwives, have professional indemnity insurance cover as a condition of their professional registration. This of course is an agreement which is being implemented by states and territories as well as by the Commonwealth but is not currently yet before any parliament in the country, a fact that I would have presumed the member for Dickson might have bothered to find out. The government, though, has always maintained a concern - and I have made it quite clear that I was concerned about this - about the potential impact of this draft legislation on a small number of midwives who provide homebirthing services and an independent private capacity outside state run services and without indemnity cover.I am pleased to advise that on Friday last week, at a health ministers' conference with state and territory colleagues, I was able to negotiate an agreement with the states and territories which will preserve the current rights of women who choose to have homebirth. Health ministers have agreed to a transitional clause in the national registration for a two-year exemption, which will last until July 2012, from the requirement to hold insurance as a condition of registration for privately practising midwives who are unable to obtain professional indemnity insurance for attending a homebirth. Importantly, state and territory health ministers agreed with our request that in order to access this exemption privately practising midwives will need to provide full disclosure, report each homebirth and participate in quality and safety frameworks. This is a sensible and practical arrangement which will allow for the status quo for women who choose homebirthing and continue to make that choice. Plus, for the first time, we will be able to collect national data on homebirthing and gather important information on quality and safety.So now is the time that the member for Dickson and the Liberal Party need to tell the 285,000 nurses and midwives across the country whether or not they are going to support increasing recognition for nurses and midwives, providing greater access to quality health care for patients and providing more choice and access to maternity services. Nurses want to know the answer, midwives want to know the answer and women across the country want to know where the Liberal Party stands on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. As the shadow minister would be aware, the AEC has also referred to the arrangements that we have announced in relation to the signs, which satisfy the requirements for authorisation. It strikes me as passing strange that the shadow minister would have become so concerned about this topic, given the track record of the former government when it came to signage and recognition arrangements. I have some material here that I could go to but I do not want to restrain the House for too long on this question. I draw the House's attention to the Investing in Our Schools Program Guidelines for state schools. That was the one we were referring to a little bit earlier with the 80 per cent costing. It says:Stickers with modified plaque wording are to be attached to all books and smaller library resource items. 
A government member - Come in, spinner! - I have been asked about programs and compliance with Australian Electoral Commission guidelines. Obviously, precedence and what has happened in the past are relevant to this. My attention has been, and I think the House's attention probably should be, drawn to the fact that under the old Investing in Our Schools Program guidelines if you ended up with a school grant and, say, bought 5,000 books for your library every one of them had to have a sticker included in it. Every piece of material bought with the Investing in Our Schools Program money - 10,000 books or 5,000 books - needed to have a sticker in it. Having had my attention drawn to this sticker here - it is very small print, so it may be challenging for some of us - I actually do not see an authorisation. I do not see an authorisation that would satisfy the Australian Electoral Commission on it.Whilst we are on the question of school signs and other things, my attention has also been drawn to signage under the Investing in Our Schools Program. Here is one example, at the Wantirna Primary School, that actually told you who opened the project. It helpfully tells you that it was Chris Pearce, the member for Aston. It tells you that he opened the project, obviously, at a school. Once again, it is not authorised in terms of Australian Electoral Commission style authorisation. Whilst I may be straying onto -  - The only member of the opposition that I am fonder of than the member for Sturt is the member for O'Connor. He is one of my special favourites. I thank him for his very frank concession that the Howard government behaved in a wrong fashion when it was in office. I thank him for that concession and say that he, at least, is an honest man on those topics. The Howard government behaved wrongly in office - here comes an apology for it. - Finally, though it may be straying onto the portfolio responsibilities of the minister for infrastructure, my attention has also been drawn to this sign under Roads to Recovery, just outside a school fence. No authorisation on that one. I think the minister would confirm to me that under the AusLink guidelines, to take just one example, such signage was displayed for at least 12 months after the project was finished. So there are some of the precedents on the question of signage and precedent. - I say to the shadow minister opposite, who is obviously concerned about these questions, that we will comply with any requirements of the Australian Electoral Commission. He may like, at some point, to explain the conduct of the Howard government on these questions.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and I know what a very strong interest he has when it comes to aged-care matters and our aged-care workforce. I also know how particularly pleased he was about the additional residential places and community care places and the capital grant that was allocated in the last aged-care approvals round for Deakin and his continuing interest in aged care. The Rudd government is building a modern aged-care system to help meet the challenges of our ageing population. We are investing in our aged-care workforce to increase skills and to build an aged-care workforce for the future. Our aged-care workers provide such an invaluable and important service right across our nation. In fact, I have had the opportunity to visit many nursing homes right across the country. We have nearly 3,000 nursing homes and I have been very privileged to meet many of the wonderful staff that work there. These people are truly inspirational when it comes to their dedication and their commitment to the work that they do within our nursing homes. I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of the more than 260,000 people who are currently employed within our aged-care sector and who are providing care to our older Australians, and I thank them for their continued commitment.The provision of high-quality aged-care services relies on the presence of a skilled workforce. That is why the Rudd government is making substantial investments in training and skills development for our aged-care workers. To date the government has invested $127 million to provide additional training to more than 21,000 aged-care enrolled nurses and personal care workers. This is taking place through a mix of programs such as the Better Skills for Better Care Program that funds the training of residential aged-care workers, the Better Skills for Better Care Program for community care workers and the Aged Care Nursing Scholarship Scheme, as well as programs to provide incentives for nurses to return to aged care after an absence.I was pleased to recently be at the TAFE at Ballina on the North Coast of New South Wales in the electorate of Page making an announcement. That announcement was for a $43.8 million package to train more than 8,000 aged and community care workers throughout the country. Through this package, more than 3,000 community care workers and more than 5,000 residential aged-care workers will receive training. Present on that day at Ballina TAFE was the UnitingCare Ageing North Coast Residential Group manager, Natalie Carter, and she said: 'The residents we are getting in aged care are more complex, clinically complex, and higher skilled staff enables better care for those people.' We are responding to that by this major investment in this training package. We are also investing in care specific training in areas such as dementia care, oral health and medication management as well.Aged-care qualifications are also amongst the most popular qualifications sought through the government's Skilling Australia for the Future program. As at July this year, nearly 12,000 people had enrolled in aged care qualifications under the Productivity Places Program. In fact, it is the second most popular qualification sought through the government's massive investment in training places. These are practical and commonsense measures to help people gain skills and build a long-term career in the aged-care sector. The Rudd government is investing in the aged-care system today by providing more funding than any previous Australian government in our aged-care sector. We are working with aged-care providers to build a modern aged-care system to meet the challenges of the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As the member is probably aware, when the government announced the $42 billion nation-building package - the economic stimulus that we need to support Australian jobs with Building the Education Revolution as its centrepiece - one of the components of the Building the Education Revolution program was our pledge to construct 500 science and language centres around the country. This was the only part of the program that was done by way of competitive bid. The National School Pride Program was an entitlement for all schools calibrated to school size. The Primary Schools for the 21st Century program was a program for all primary schools calibrated to school size. The Science and Language Centres program was one where applications were made and assessed. There were various criteria, including need. The applications were not assessed by me. They were assessed by an independent panel and the independent panel made recommendations to government. Government has funded 537 of those applications as recommended by the independent panel. So we have more than delivered on that promise. The overdelivery on that promise was able to be done at a lesser cost than the $1 billion originally budgeted for. So, when it came to making adjustments within the $42 billion Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, the residual money of that billion dollars was reallocated to help support expenditure under Primary Schools for the 21st Century. Obviously, in earlier questions in question time today I have explained how that costing was done and what was changed about that costing.I say to the member for New England that I understand that any school that missed out on a competitive funding round would be disappointed. But we have pledged to fund 500 science and language centres and we are actually constructing more. -  - I hear interjections from the Liberal Party, from the opposition, about priorities in relation to this. Because we are keeping it within the $42 billion funding envelope, obviously if we were to fund more science and language centres that would need to come at a cost somewhere else in the program. -  - To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah and the member for Sturt, who are interjecting, I say this: if they want at any point to walk into the parliament and table at the dispatch box a list of schools which should not be funded under the National School Pride program or should not be funded under Primary Schools for the 21st Century in order to fund more science and language centres within the $42 billion envelope of our economic stimulus plan then they should feel free to do that. But I have issued that challenge to them before and I have not yet got a list from them about the schools they say should not be funded. I will set that test, that homework, for the shadow minister, and any time he wants to furnish that list of schools that according to the Liberal Party should be not funded I will be very ready to receive it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. All of us in this place share her concern. The Montara oil spill is a very unfortunate incident and we must do everything we can to make sure it does not happen again. Right now, however, our top priorities are to respond to the oil spill and minimise harm to the environment, and to shut in the leaking well and stop the flow of oil and gas safely and as soon as possible. I was able to inspect the impact of the incident personally on Saturday, 29 August as part of a daily aerial inspection that was being undertaken by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA. Dispersants are also being applied from the air and water, and this has been successful in accelerating the breakdown of the oil. Coastal and reef areas are not currently at risk.The operator of the oilfield, PTTEP, has decided to stop the leak by drilling a relief well to intercept the leaking well. The best advice available from Geoscience Australia and my department was that this is the most technically feasible, safest and fastest option to shut in the well. A number of companies in Australia have offered drilling rigs to undertake this work. These were all properly considered from a technical, safety and timing perspective. Again, Geoscience Australia and my department concurred with PTTEP that the West Triton, a jack-up drilling rig in Batam, Indonesia, should be mobilised to do the job. PTTEP also has appropriate contingency plans in place.It is very disappointing that some politicians with no technical expertise, as far as I am aware, and in a politically opportunistic way acted like they thought they knew better. The Australian community can rest assured that the government took the best technical advice and will continue to put safety and the environment before populist politics. The West Triton is due to arrive at the Montara oilfield this Thursday. It will take about four weeks to complete drilling and well operations, taking us to early October to shut in the well. Then we will focus on a full independent investigation into the operational, human and regulatory factors surrounding the incident. We have to learn from this incident and put in place any measures that are necessary to stop it happening again.I indicate that at the conclusion of question time I will be seeking leave of the House to make a full ministerial statement concerning these matters. I will also look to work with the opposition in respect of legislative change to enable a full and independent investigation to occur.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the shadow minister for his question. It gives me the opportunity to explain - and the shadow minister, I think, is aware of this - that in the process of killing Work Choices, something that the Rudd Labor government was elected to do and has very proudly set about doing, we have passed three pieces of legislation through this parliament. The first of them stopped the making of Australian workplace agreements and authorised award modernisation. The second set up our Fair Work system. The third dealt with transitional and consequential matters.I think the shadow minister points to an interview that I gave on Sky in March 2008. Of course, when I gave that interview I was very proudly proclaiming that workers in this country would be better off as a result of the determination of the Rudd government to kill Work Choices and to get rid of award-stripping AWAs, and that is precisely what we have done. Then, with the award modernisation process, we have taken a belts and braces approach to ensuring that employees are not in any way disadvantaged by this process. We set 'no disadvantage for employees' as an objective of award modernisation, and the Prime Minister was interviewed about these matters on radio last week.But in our third piece of legislation we also put in place as 'the braces' a system of take-home pay guarantees. This is a mechanism to make absolutely sure that no employee in Australia would have his or her take-home pay cut as a result of the making of a modern award. I would draw the House's attention to a very important statement made about this matter and some unbelievably wise words dealing with the question of take-home pay guarantees:This is reasonable and it gives effect to one of the minister's promises - an undertaking that no employees will be disadvantaged under her changes.Who said those unbelievably wise words, those very erudite words? It was none other than the shadow minister for workplace relations. I rely on and adopt his form of words. He is absolutely right: we have taken a belt and braces approach to looking after Australian employees. I thank him for the fact that he was so frank about it in this parliament on Hansard. He was very helpful indeed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. My department continues to work closely with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and relevant Commonwealth and state agencies to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to respond to any impact on wildlife and the broader environment that may result from this oil spill. It is a matter of great concern to me as environment minister. On Friday last week I accompanied AMSA on a flight over the site to see the extent of the spill firsthand and spoke to the officers working there who are monitoring it and responding to it. Emergency response measures have been in place since the uncontrolled release began on 21 August and, as the House has just heard, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority continues to lead the federal response to this matter.The most immediate priority, as the Minister for Resources and Energy has just pointed out, remains to stem the flow of oil as soon as practicable by blocking the leaking well. This is a particularly complex engineering operation. To ensure that this essential operation is in no way delayed by the need to seek formal statutory approval for the necessary works, I can advise the House that last night I formally exempted these actions from the requirements of the EPBC Act on the basis that it was in the national interest to do so. Granting an exemption from the operation of the EPBC Act is not an action that any minister would take lightly, but I think there is little doubt that the environmental consequences of allowing the spill to continue whilst an environmental impact assessment is being prepared would be far worse than any impacts that might arise from actions taken to stem the flow.Since the spill was reported my department has been working closely with AMSA and relevant Commonwealth and state agencies to put in place a plan of action to help any wildlife that might be affected by the oil spill in Commonwealth waters and to respond to possible impacts on nearby Commonwealth reserves. This plan has been developed by an expert in wildlife response from the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management who coordinated the wildlife response to the Moreton Bay oil spill earlier this year. Last week that expert carried out surveillance of the area, including the Ashmore Reef and Cartier Island Commonwealth marine reserves. The plan of action includes measures for treating any wildlife found that might be affected by oil at Ashmore and Cartier marine reserves, which are within about 80 nautical miles of the site. This includes ensuring that the appropriate response equipment is on site should it be needed. Customs and Border Protection Command officers on site at Ashmore are also regularly surveying the reserve for any identifiable impacts.Whilst the spill is some distance from the Ashmore and Cartier reserves, my department continues to work with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority to develop a response plan should any oil, including residue, reach these fragile areas. At the same time, the department will continue to work closely with the Western Australian government, which has plans in place to deal with any oil affected wildlife that might be found in state waters or that might come ashore on the Western Australian coastline. And to ensure that any longer term environmental impacts of the spill are appropriately addressed, my department is also working with the company responsible for the rig, PTTEP, to ensure that a comprehensive, long-term environmental monitoring program is put in place. The government is working to ensure that we do put in place all the necessary and practicable measures to respond to the threat presented by this oil spill to our precious environment.</DOC>

 - I would again refer to that statement by the honourable member who has just asked the question, where he says that he endorses the position taken by the minister, and I would refer to his statement in the House on 2 June 2009. The government's mandate to reform the industrial relations system in this country is absolutely clear-cut: get rid of Work Choices, get rid of AWAs and bring in a fair and balanced industrial relations system. That is what we have done. The government stands by the policy underpinning that legislation and supports the determinations which were contained in the statements by the AIRC last week. In terms of transitional arrangements for both employers and employees, it is the right policy for the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. This is a very important day. Today Mr Tony Negus was sworn in as Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police effective from today. In attendance were the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the Acting Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia and me, as well representatives from other police jurisdictions and many other distinguished guests. It was a very important event.Commissioner Negus has had a distinguished 27 years in the AFP and has worked across the spectrum in the Australian Federal Police. He has worked in community policing, federal investigations, human resources, training and protection. He has worked overseas and understands the growing need to engage with counterparts within our region and across the world. He is highly regarded. I am sure the opposition would agree that the new Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is highly regarded and widely respected by his Australian domestic and international law enforcement colleagues as well as the AFP's many partner law enforcement agencies. The commissioner has most recently held responsibility for high-tech crime operations, border activities, international liaison networks, economic and special operations, forensics and the international deployment group, and he is extremely well qualified to lead this very important law enforcement agency.Tony Negus said today, after being sworn in by the acting chief justice, that protecting the Australian community against the threat of terrorism and serious organised crime will remain the primary focus of the Australian Federal Police's policing activities. This is a focus that the Rudd government fully endorses. The AFP is 30 years old and is entering a significant phase in its development. Commissioner Negus will be working, supported by the Rudd government, to deliver more sworn police onto the front-line investigations in the fight against organised crime and transnational crime and terrorism.In welcoming this appointment, the government would also like to acknowledge the significant contribution of the outgoing commissioner, Commissioner Mick Keelty, in his leading role of the AFP since 2001. Commissioner Kelty has demonstrated an outstanding leadership during a period of significant growth in the size, the nature and the complexity of the AFP's operations in Australia and abroad. He also led the AFP through a challenging period including events such as the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Bali bombings, the Jakarta embassy bombing, the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and the 2003 Canberra bushfires. Commissioner Keelty has played a key role in driving greater cooperation and coordination in law enforcement operations with a number of Commonwealth and state authorities and has forged important relationships with law enforcement partners throughout the region. He leaves a lasting legacy within the Australian Federal Police and in law enforcement generally in Australia and within the region.</DOC>

 - In the 2004 election campaign, the former Prime Minister promised to keep interest rates at record lows. Of course, what eventuated thereafter was 10 interest rate increases in a row. So when this government took office we had a pattern of rising interest rates which continued for the first few months of that term in office. We now have the Reserve Bank rate at three per cent; of course, the rate was 6.75 per cent when the government took office.This government absolutely rejects the suggestion - the ludicrous proposition - that our fiscal settings are putting upward pressure on interest rates. That suggestion from the opposition has attracted derision from a wide range of respected economic commentators. We have got circumstances in the global economy that the opposition simply refuses to acknowledge. In fact, we had the bizarre proposition today from the member for Sturt, pronouncing that it is all over: the global financial crisis, the recession and the difficulties in the Australian economy are all over - it was all in your imagination; it is all finished! What are we worrying about?The truth is we have a major economic challenge still underway in this country. As far as the government is concerned it is true to say, over the past six months, 'Yes, so far so good. The stimulus strategy has been working, and working well.' But there are many challenges in front of us, and it would be absolutely retrograde of the government to withdraw that stimulus. In fact, I note today that an organisation that is usually supportive of the opposition on many matters - ACCI - came out and said precisely that. You cannot even get ACCI to support your position. The organisation that has a long history of being very close to the Liberal Party, the employers' organisation, points out that peremptory withdrawal of the stimulus would threaten the recovery, would threaten the Australian economy, would threaten jobs and would threaten businesses.It is a sorry situation when the conservative parties in this country cannot even get the No. 1 employer organisation to support their economic policy. That speaks volumes for the economic competence of the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. I am also taken by the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has just asked a question about a Dun and Bradstreet survey. I found that a remarkable intervention by the Leader of the Opposition because, according to the Dun and Bradstreet business confidence survey, today we have a positive picture of business confidence and expectations. Sales and profits expectations for the December quarter have risen significantly; 46 per cent of respondents expect an increase in sales, 31 per cent expect an increase in profit, and the employment indicator has risen sharply - 16 per cent of businesses expect to increase staff. - Furthermore, capital investment expectations are at their highest level in two years, 16 per cent of firms expect to increase their cap ex and inventories are expected to rise for 20 per cent of firms. I quote from Dun and Bradstreet CEO Christine Christian:The improvement in key indices such as employment and sales expectations is a sign that the economic stimulus has been successful in encouraging household spending.I notice the member for North Sydney stopped interjecting, 'This proves our point.' She said, 'The economic stimulus has been successful in encouraging household spending.' I just draw the honourable member for North Sydney's attention to a full reading of Dun and Bradstreet, and perhaps the Leader of the Opposition might do the same.But there is more: the NAB Monthly Business Survey and Economic Outlook is out today. It says that business confidence has surged a further eight points to 18. NAB goes on to say:_ the result is the strongest since October 2003 and indicates that businesses are very optimistic about the monetary and fiscal measures undertaken by authorities to deal with the current global crisis as well as the resultant economic impacts.Let me just go back to it again: the monetary and fiscal measures undertaken by authorities. I think one of those authorities is the Australian government because we are responsible for fiscal policy. I would have thought that on a reading of that, member for North Sydney, that what it points to by way of positive data in terms of business confidence and business conditions has not simply materialised out of thin air; it has been the construct in part of government policy acting through stimulus in the economy. We have therefore these outcomes from the business confidence survey of the NAB and of course the business confidence survey and business conditions survey by Dun and Bradstreet. These are important figures and I simply draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that business confidence is now up 50 points from its trough in January - and remember: January was when we were absolutely in the pits of what was unfolding globally.I also draw the honourable member's attention to this statement from the NAB monthly business survey:Retailing is now no more the best performing among the cyclical sectors, although it still remains positive overall. That mantle has now been handed over to construction.Presumably that construction materialises out of thin air - it just happens! I can say to the honourable members opposite, with their rolling, negative campaign about the government stimulus strategy, that neither retail sales go up because of thin air factors nor does construction go up because of thin air factors. It is because, in the worst global economic crisis in three-quarters of a century, government policy action has been out there, shoulder to the wheel, supporting the economy while the private sector is in retreat. These two pieces of data come off the back of what we had with the ANZ job advertisements data of yesterday, which showed an increase of 4.1 per cent in August. This was the first monthly increase since April 2008.These things reflect positive signs for the Australian economy but, as I said yesterday and will continue to say, we still have major global economic challenges lying ahead. We still have great uncertainties in the US economy and in the European economies and in those in North Asia as well. Therefore, for those opposite to argue, as they continue to do, that the government should pull the rug from under the recovery by abolishing stimulus now through the Nation Building for Recovery plan is simply not responding practically to the uncertain data which exists out there in the global economy. - Ah, the member for North Sydney: always interjecting. With Joe, you know that the volume of the interjection is directly proportional to the thinness of the content. It always happens that way with Joe.In response to the global economic crisis the government have embarked upon a National Building for Recovery plan. We have embarked upon three stages of stimulus. Seventy per cent of the stimulus is in infrastructure. Our stimulus is designed to do this: to support jobs, small business and apprenticeships today by investing in the infrastructure Australia needs for tomorrow. I say also to honourable members that I am advised that one of our senators had a few problems on the doors today when he was interviewed about fiscal stimulus. He had a problem with the spelling of the word 'fiscal'. This is of no real consequence; anyone can make mistakes in spelling. I make mistakes in spelling; I am sure other members make spelling mistakes as well. -  - It is true. Everyone makes spelling mistakes. However, making a spelling mistake on fiscal stimulus is one thing. Having profound misjudgement on fiscal stimulus is something else, and those opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition, have shown profound misjudgement on fiscal stimulus.Every single mainstream economic commentator in the country - everyone from the peak industry organisations, to the major public economists, to those responsible for the treasuries and the central banks of the G20 economies through to our own Treasury and our own central bank - has argued that this is the right course of policy action - except for one single organisation, tattered and swinging in the breeze though it is. That organisation is the Liberal and National Party coalition of Australia. They alone believe that they have a script for the economic future. They alone believe that it was wrong to use stimulus in response to the worst global economic challenge since the Great Depression. They now argue that the rug should be pulled out from under recovery now that we have achieved some results from the stimulus we have injected. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to those opposite: reflect honestly and impartially on the economic data which is before us and, for the first time in the period that he has been Leader of the Opposition, start talking the Australian economy up rather than continuing to talk to the Australian economy down.</DOC>

 - The government strategy does have within it a number of initiatives that are due to run out in a short order of time, particularly things like the first home owner grant boost and the incentive for businesses to invest in equipment. The stimulus strategy is calibrated to tail down over a period of time, but I refer again to the Australian Chamber of Commerce Industry, ACCI, press release today which does warn everybody about the risks of peremptorily withdrawing, prematurely withdrawing, the stimulus strategy. The government does not speculate about what may happen with interest rates in the future, but I remind the opposition of their recent track record on these issues. After having promised at the 2004 election to keep interest rates at record lows, they then delivered an economy which saw 10 interest rate increases in a row.The government's policy settings are not putting and will not put upward pressure on interest rates. Finally, I remind the opposition of the government strategy to return the budget to surplus and point out, as I have pointed out in the media over the last couple of days, that the stimulus strategy is a relatively small proportion of total government spending. In order to return the budget to surplus the focus is not going to be on that small proportion of government spending; it is going to be on the ongoing totality of government spending across the board. That is where the focus will be.We do have a major challenge to return the budget to surplus, because $210 billion over four years of revenue has been knocked out of that budget by the global financial crisis and the global recession and much of that is not going to return in a hurry because of a resumption of growth. That is why we have put in place a restraint of two per cent real growth on government spending once growth resumes, that is why we have put in place strategies to deliver more savings, that is why there were tough savings initiatives in the budget this year; and that is why it is really important that the opposition passes all of those tough savings initiatives in the Senate and starts to put its money where its mouth is instead of coming in here every day and criticising the government for not exercising enough fiscal restraint. - I was just urging the opposition to start practising what it preaches. If it is suggesting that we need fiscal restraint - if it is suggesting we need spending restraint - then what it should do is pass things like the budget and private health insurance and rebate reforms in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question and know that she, like all members of the Rudd Labor government, is unapologetic about supporting jobs in our economy today. We are unapologetic about taking decisive measures to keep Australians working. Whilst those opposite sit and wait and watch the unemployment numbers go up, the Rudd government has decided to provide immediate stimulus to the Australian economy to make a difference to the ability of Australians to secure and stay in work. Without that decisive action we would have seen, and would have continued to see, more than 200,000 extra Australians out of work - something that members opposite should reflect on. We know that employment and unemployment are lagging indicators of economic activity. That is why, even with the decisive action the government has taken to provide economic stimulus to the economy, the government understands and has been clear about the unhappy truth that we expect unemployment to rise over the coming months and we will see new indications in the unemployment figures later this week.I am very pleased to be able to report to the House that during these difficult economic times - during the days of the global recession - we are seeing employers and employees, employer organisations and trade unions working together to do what they can to keep people employed. What we have seen with the employment numbers over the last six months is a rise in part-time work and a reduction in full-time work. This would, in part, reflect the fact that many firms have learnt the lesson and are doing everything they can to keep their valued staff in work during these difficult economic days. And this is good news, because once Australians become unemployed statistics tell us it can be a difficult road back. During the 1980s the unemployment rate jumped from 5.4 per cent to 10.4 per cent in two years. It took another six years to get it back down. In the 1990s the unemployment rate increased by a similar amount in the space of three years, but this time it took 11 years to get it back down. So keeping people connected to work is a very important thing to do. That is what economic stimulus is about and that is what these cooperative workplace arrangements are all about. I would point in that regard to the example of Mitsubishi Motors, which in February this year announced it would be closing its assembly vehicle plant in Adelaide. - Sorry, February last year; thank you very much. That resulted in 930 direct job losses, but there were cooperative arrangements to help those affected workers secure work and those cooperative arrangements were supported by both state and federal governments. We have seen short-time working arrangements entered into - for example, at Holden - where short-time working arrangements have kept people connected to the workforce. These are important developments that we are seeing across the nation - employers of goodwill working together with employees and trade unions to make arrangements during these difficult days of the global recession. The government supports and applauds the efforts of those working together with economic stimulus. They are providing support to Australians and keeping Australians working.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to hear that the Leader of the Opposition pays attention to speeches on cost-effective policy by the Secretary of the Treasury. I had referred him to one in March 2007 on precisely that point - which is a landmark event in the deterioration of the Howard government. - I reiterate my point that the Secretary of the Treasury has a long track record of drawing attention to this issue. He did so in a way that proved rather embarrassing for the Howard government and pointed out the massive failings on its policy front. I most vividly recall the infamous gestation of the $10 billion water plan which was on the back of a serviette at a long lunch. -  - I have a vague recollection that the member for Wentworth and the Leader of the Opposition was in fact minister for water in the former government at a time when they announced their $10 billion water plan, which had not even been costed by the department of finance, much less subject to any cost-benefit analysis. -  - If the point of order, as I understand it, goes to the relevance of the answer, I simply put to the House that, in following the practice that has been for many parliaments, the finance minister has taken an aspect of the question, which he is directing his remarks to. Whilst this is a definition of relevance that may be a mystery to many, it has been the way in which question time has been conducted for a while. I have urged the House to use the Procedure Committee to look at these matters, but that has not happened yet. The minister for finance has the call. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked about cost-benefit analysis approaches to the government's stimulus package and, in particular, the Building the Education Revolution initiative. I will tell you, Mr Speaker, and I will tell the Leader of the Opposition the cost-benefit analysis approach that was taken. It was this: we received advice from the Secretary of Treasury and other Treasury officials that a huge storm was about to hit the Australian economy and that it was necessary to get money into the Australian economy - inject it into the Australian economy in a variety of ways as quickly as possible to sustain hundreds of thousand of jobs and thousands of businesses - and that the best way of undertaking this was a staged process which involved, firstly, payments to individuals through the tax system and the family payment system, which would get money moving into households very quickly; secondly, money that could be moved quickly into maintenance, into infrastructure, into building things and into sustaining the construction sector and, thirdly, longer term infrastructure projects that would build Australia for the future.We understand that the other side is now back in the zone where they do not believe the global financial crisis or the global recession are real. They have waxed and waned, they have gone in and out of the twilight zone, they have been off there with the zombies, they have been all over the place and they are now back in the zone where they have discovered that it never happened - that it did not exist. The member for Sturt has pronounced it dead; it did not happen; it is all over today. The truth is that the cost-benefit analysis for the Australian people was this: without rapid action on the part of this government through injecting large sums of money into the Australian economy, into construction, into retail, into tourism and into all of the activities of the Australian economy we would be facing unemployment much higher than we do today. We would be facing thousands of businesses, particularly small businesses, that would be bankrupt. That was the basis on which that decision was taken, along with all of the other stimulus decisions. This government stands proudly by those decisions and we point out that virtually every other serious commentator and participant in this debate says we were right and you were wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank member for Parramatta for her question. There has been some commentary today about how the funding for the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure program matches up to the political balance in the House of Representatives. I must say I was surprised by some of the commentary because it simply does not stack up to analysis. Indeed, Labor members of parliament - those fine men and women on this side of the chamber - make up some 55 per cent of the House of Representatives. We, the electorates represented by the fine men and women here, got 53 per cent of the funding for the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure program.It was also claimed that marginal electorates received a disproportionate amount of the funding. Marginal seats, measured by the standard measure of a margin of less than five per cent, make up a third of the seats in this parliament. They received less than a quarter of the funding under this program. By comparison, safe electorates - the standard measure is a margin of more than 10 per cent - make up 35 per cent of this parliament. They received 41 per cent of the funding. Indeed, one of the comments that came from local governments as a result of this program, whether in safe Labor seats or safe Liberal seats, was that it was the first time that the government had recognised that you should not have to be in a marginal seat to get funding from the Commonwealth government. Certainly the Mayor of Mosman was very vocal about that, as were the Mayor of Warringah, the Mayor of Ku-ring-gai and a number of the mayors represented opposite.The other statement that was made was a claim that funding went disproportionately to Labor heartland seats. Well, safe Labor seats, as measured, received an average of $3.5 million. Safe non-Labor seats received an average of $6.1 million across the program. The great benefit of this program was not that bureaucrats sat down and made decisions; it was that local government made applications as a result of their priorities that they determined as local representatives. Indeed, every single local government area in the country - all 565 - benefited from at least $100,000 of the funding under the first component.But let us look at the top 10 projects - and I am glad the Prime Minister selects the frontbench now, because I am not sure I am doing myself some favours with the caucus! Of the top 10 projects, the first is Gold Coast Stadium in Moncrieff, a Liberal electorate - $36 million. Do you support that funding or not? Do you support it? I think the member for Moncrieff supports that project. - The member for North Sydney wants the spending to stop, but none of his colleagues do. The member for Dickson is so keen about the Gold Coast Stadium that he is moving there to get a piece of the action - so keen is he.The second is the Einasleigh River bridge in the electorate of Kennedy, a flood-affected area. We gave special consideration to those areas affected by floods or bushfires. It came second - $18 million.The third was the Flinders Street Mall redevelopment in Townsville, in the electorate of Herbert, again held by the Liberal Party. The member for Herbert is nodding. He supports this funding of $16.2 million. He does. He nods in support of this funding. I say to the member for North Sydney: look around you and talk to your colleagues.The fourth was the Goulburn River High Country Rail Trail, in the electorates of Indi and McEwen, again two Liberal electorates. - The only person saying, 'Stop spending money,' Joe, is you, because last week I was out with your backbenchers, with them campaigning for extra money from the second round.The fact is that this compares in stark contrast with what the former government did, and I was asked about that. Under the former government's Regional Partnerships program - the 'Regional Rorts' program - one-third of the funding went to just 10 coalition electorates - not a single Labor electorate on the list, not one. I sat in this place for 12 years and there was not a single grant to my electorate, not one. The fact is that those opposite rorted the Regional Partnerships program. They did not go through local government; they went through the private sector. There was a million dollars for an ethanol plant in Gunnedah that does not exist, $420,000 for a cheese factory that closed down and $845,000 for a rail line that burnt down. The contrast is very stark.We on this side of the House have set up a rigorous process that stacks up, that does not advantage us politically, and that stands in stark contrast to the actions of those involved with their 'Regional Rorts' program.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. I enjoyed his questions yesterday and I am going to enjoy them today, I can see as well. I am still waiting for his much promised ferocious attack but we live in hope. On the question of Evesham State School, let me inform the member of this: he may not be aware of it but the Evesham State School at this stage is in community consultation about an amalgamation process. -  - This consultation process has been in train for some time. -  - I take from the guffawing that the Liberal Party stands for the unilateral closure of schools without any consultation with anyone. If that is the policy of the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition, I will make sure that all 9,500 schools in this country know that. But most responsible education authorities actually engage in consultation and work when they are coming up with new school structures and the Building the Education Revolution guidelines dealt with this process.We have had media reports and we have had members of the opposition on earlier parliamentary days race into this parliament and make claims about Building the Education Revolution money going to closing schools. This matter was always dealt with by the Building the Education Revolution guidelines and what the guidelines have provided is crystal clear, which is that in circumstances where schools are amalgamating the money goes to the continuing school site in order to provide facilities for the students who go to that school. That is obviously an appropriate process to go through when schools are amalgamating. I take it from the guffawing that the members opposite are saying that, firstly, there should be no consultation and, secondly, there should be no benefits to schools that are amalgamating and receiving students from other schools.I think it does bear reflecting on that the Building the Education Revolution program is about school modernisation, the biggest school modernisation program this country has ever seen, but it is also about supporting jobs today during the difficult days of the global recession, and members opposite day after day, including in their questioning today, show how out of touch they are on the question of the global recession and its impact on Australian jobs. As recently as yesterday the shadow minister for education said on Radio National about our economic stimulus measures and our measures for school building about construction work:There wouldn't be enough workers. There wouldn't be enough resources to fulfil those contracts as quickly as the government demand it.The shadow minister obviously lives in a world where he thinks in these days of the global recession that every Australian who wants a job has a job and that every Australian is already working the overtime they would want to be working and that there is no spare capacity. He lives in a world of denial, believing that the global recession has not commenced and is not impacting on our economy. But the truth is - and the Prime Minister referred to this a little bit earlier - it is impacting on our economy, and the recent AiG survey of construction works showed that employment in construction declined 17 months in a row. When you are seeing construction work decline 17 months in a row, when you are seeing construction workers who are being laid off and who are not able to find work, then obviously they are the people whose jobs the Building the Education Revolution will give support to.Can I conclude my answer to the shadow minister's question by referring him to an article in the Australian newspaper on 1 September where builder Wayne Cash, who was working on one of the Building the Education Revolution projects, said:_ the first six months of the year were very quiet, and the company was forced to let two or three staff members go but managed to keep their apprentices and junior staff members.Mr Cash is now not only hiring subcontractors but also putting on extra staff, including another apprentice, a labourer and an office junior, and perhaps at some point the shadow minister might want to reflect on whether he thinks those Australian should be in work.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Lindsay for his question. The member for Lindsay is a very strong supporter of small business, in particular in his local area of the Penrith Valley and his support for the Penrith City and District Business Enterprise Centre, which is being financially supported for the first time by the Commonwealth of Australia under the Rudd government's leadership.There has been encouraging recent news. Yesterday we were reminded of the ANZ job advertisements which showed the first monthly rise since April of 2008, so that is encouraging news. That is pretty good. Today, Dun and Bradstreet in their national business expectation survey recorded the highest sales expectations in five years and the greatest rise in one quarter recorded since the survey began in 1988. Also out today, the National Australia Bank's monthly business survey reported that business confidence has reached its highest level since October 2003, so this is all encouraging news.Last week the national accounts were out, showing positive growth for the June quarter of 0.6 per cent and growth in investment in plant and equipment of 5.6 per cent, so clearly the government's strategy for managing the economic downturn is working. The stimulus is helping to restore business confidence and, in particular, small business confidence. We know how vital that is in sustaining the economic viability of small businesses, because if businesses are confident then they will invest in the future and, very importantly, they will ensure that they keep on their staff to the maximum extent possible.Instead of making a constructive contribution to the policy debate the Leader of the Opposition has in fact opportunistically held just about every conceivable position on the stimulus. I will spare members opposite the task of going through all of those different positions, but I can report that initially he said it was about right - that was a flip. Then he said it was not enough - that was a flop. He then went on to say it makes no difference - flip - and then finally he said it is too much and it ought to be withdrawn. But on this matter the Leader of the Opposition remains isolated. I have been looking around since yesterday for any support that we might be able to find for the Leader of the Opposition's position that the stimulus should be withdrawn. I cannot find any support. The International Monetary Fund has said:Premature exit from accommodative monetary and fiscal policy is a principal concern.We have had the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States warning about not repeating the mistakes of withdrawing stimulus prematurely. The OECD said:_ strong policy stimulus will continue to be needed in the near term.The World Bank said countries should be prepared to:_ take additional steps and not withdraw stimulus in 2010.So there are the four major international organisations warning about withdrawing stimulus prematurely, warning against the policies of the Leader of the Opposition.Here at home we have the Commonwealth Treasury saying do not withdraw the stimulus prematurely. We have the Reserve Bank saying do not withdraw the stimulus prematurely. We have the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry saying do not withdraw the stimulus prematurely. We have Craig James, from CommSec, saying, 'We wouldn't be advocating that the government or the Reserve Bank change the settings in any way at the moment' - that is, do not withdraw the stimulus prematurely. The Ai Group said, 'In relation to early withdrawal of the stimulus we would be getting well ahead of ourselves' - that is, do not withdraw the stimulus prematurely. Michael Blythe, the Commonwealth Bank's Chief Economist, said, 'The Australian economy will continue to benefit from economic policy stimulus in 2009.' ANZ economist Riki Polygenis said, 'Government policy actions continue to be a critical factor supporting the economy.' Annette Beecher, of TD Securities, said, 'Don't withdraw the stimulus prematurely.' AMP Securities senior economist Bob Cunneen said, 'Don't withdraw the stimulus prematurely.' The scorecard is that a total of 13 international and national organisations have said do not withdraw the stimulus prematurely, do not take the advice of the Leader of the Opposition, because that would undermine economic growth and business confidence in this country - that is, 13 in favour of continuing the stimulus and one against.I noticed before question time that the Leader of the Opposition was holding a press conference and he was using the phrase 'as night follows day'. I wondered when I had heard that before from a Liberal opposition leader. I remember that none other than Andrew Peacock preceded Malcolm Turnbull with this statement - he regularly used to say 'as night follows day'. Here is Sydney's answer to Andrew Peacock. I used to say about Andrew Peacock because he made many attempts at the leadership and he made these comebacks - and here comes the fellow who has not asked a question for 468 days -  - I will bring it to a close. I remember that Andrew Peacock used to say 'as night follows day'. We have Sydney's answer to Andrew Peacock. The only thing is that, when Andrew Peacock went through the leadership again, it was said of him that a souffle cannot rise twice. We have a dud souffle here; we cannot even get it to rise once.</DOC>

 - I had anticipated a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs but I am of course happy to answer the question of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. On the deputy leader's question, as I have had cause to explain in the House before, the Building the Education Revolution guidelines set clear specifications for the amount of money that can be spent on project management fees and also the amount that can be spent on administration costs. On project management fees the amount is four per cent, on administration costs it is 1.5 per cent. -  - I believe that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is probably referring to an article which was recently in the newspaper -  - Well, it may have been an article based on the advice that she is now showing. But I am aware of those reports, and obviously, when we see reports that there is an expenditure beyond what the guidelines provide for, we look into it. But the arrangements between us and state governments and block grant authorities in the Catholic and independent sectors are very, very clear. We made those guidelines clear because we wanted to ensure that project costs and administration costs were kept to a minimum and that this money rolled out to schools to support jobs now.What I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - and I would say it to all members of the opposition - is that at the end of the day the central part of this debate is: do you support jobs today? Do you support building infrastructure for tomorrow? -  - You have already decisively answered no to both questions. You stand neither for supporting jobs nor for modernising schools. Then, of course, given that the question was asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that when she was Minister for Education -  - Yes - a very interesting question from the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. But I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, given that she has raised the question of school capital, that when she was Minister for Education, Science and Training, as I referred to in the House yesterday, of course the Investing in Our Schools Program was costed on an 80 per cent take-up rate and she needed to fix an 18 per cent blow-out in it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin. I was down her way just recently looking at a terrific new housing affordability fund project that will make blocks of land for people to build houses on much more affordable as well as doing a nice bit of urban renewal in an area that really needs it. The government's Nation Building and Economic Stimulus Plan includes the largest single investment in social housing that has ever been undertaken by an Australian government, and it is part of our efforts to act decisively to build today the infrastructure that we will need for tomorrow while supporting the jobs that we need in the Australian economy. It is obviously working - we have seen the fastest growing economy in the developed world and the second lowest unemployment - but, of course, we are not out of the woods yet, and this investment in social housing is critical to our continued weathering of the storm.Last week I visited Tasmania to look firsthand at the work that we are doing down there through the investment in social housing. In Launceston I visited the first three homes to be completed under stage 1 of the nation-building social housing element. I met a couple of the families that have moved into those houses, and I was also able to hear about the builders and tradespeople that were employed on those jobs - 10 tradespeople were employed at varying times on that project - and the work for local businesses and contractors. I was also able to announce that, for stage 2 of the social housing stimulus package, we would be working with Tasmania to build 445 new homes in Tasmania for $109 million, supporting small businesses and jobs in Tasmania.I was also able to look at the repair and maintenance work that is being done there. I visited a quite old building of about 62 units, built around the 1960s, in New Town in Hobart. These were tiny little units, probably not much bigger than this table here. While I was visiting these units, which had become so run down that a number of the units were not livable, I met a man called Alex Lidster who is 91 years old. He told me that the work that was being done to upgrade his unit had completely changed his life, and he said that this accommodation was so necessary to him. He told the newspaper down there, the Mercury:Without it I would probably be homeless, so it is very important to me.That was a 91-year-old Tasmanian talking about the effect of this work on his quality of life. Spotless, the contractor overseeing the project, were employing 48 tradespeople and 10 apprentices to do the work that they had got through the social housing stimulus package - 48 tradespeople and 10 apprentices. So the repairs and maintenance that Spotless were doing and the other work that is being done around Tasmania have been absolutely critical to keeping those jobs in the construction sector.If you look around the country at the repairs and maintenance alone, we expected to fix up 2½ thousand homes - to bring them back from the scrap heap, essentially. Instead we will fix up about 10,600 homes. We will do major work on homes that are already uninhabitable or would have been lost to public housing stock. We will do work, altogether, on about 60,000 homes. What is particularly interesting about this is that about 35,000 homes have already had work done on them and about 15,000 homes have benefited from work being done in common areas. So those small jobs and larger jobs around the country have been supporting employment for many months now in all parts of the country where there is social housing. I was lucky enough to visit the site - in Hobart as well - of a new homelessness facility that will be built in Campbell Street and will house 50 people. It is one of the 40 new specialist homelessness facilities that we will build around the country as part of our efforts through social housing and through our homelessness spending.It is worth remembering, of course, that the opposition have not supported any of this at any stage. They have not supported the stimulus spending, they have not supported the repairs and maintenance, they have not supported the new building, they have not supported the housing for vulnerable Australians and they have not supported the jobs that have come from this work. It is our policy instead to support this housing for vulnerable Australians but also to support those jobs for tradies, for builders, for electricians, for plumbers, for carpenters, for tilers, for manufacturers of building equipment and for all of their apprentices right around the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question and I am aware, of course, that the member for Mallee in his electorate knows how much his local schools have benefited from this program. The member for Mallee, of course, when he is back in his electorate, is very keen to be associated with the expenditure in those local schools and the benefits that the Building the Education Revolution program brings. But when he comes to Canberra, when he is out of Victoria, he needs to fall behind the Leader of the Opposition's opposition to supporting jobs today and to supporting expenditure on schools. I am aware of the article that the member refers to. What the member may know about the Building the Education Revolution program that he voted against - or maybe he does not, but he ought to know it about the program - is that it is correlated to school size. What he also ought to know about the program is that it is possible for schools to put in projects that are under their allocation. On some of the divisions and ratios that appear in that Herald Sun article today, that is exactly what has happened. A school has put in for a project that is under its allocation and consequently, when you then divide that number by the number of students, you get the variations in ratios that are reported in that Herald Sun report.This is a program rolling out in every primary school across the country to bring new school capital. It is rolling out in every school across the country to bring vitally needed repairs. It is rolling out in 537 schools around the country to bring science and language centres. Schools around the country are welcoming this investment - including, of course, in the electorate of Mallee. The thing for the opposition and indeed the member who asked the question to explain is whether he is prepared to go to each school in his electorate and look a principal and a parent representative in the eye and say, 'I don't think your school should have the benefit of these facilities,' and then whether he is prepared to walk the main streets of the towns that he represents and meet local tradespeople and look them in the eye and say -  - And, to conclude, he should explain whether he is prepared to look tradespeople in the eye and say, 'I don't believe that we should be supporting your jobs during the days of the global recession.' People who care about education and supporting jobs today are supporting the Building the Education Revolution program. It is a great pity for the schools in Mallee that their local member does not.</DOC>

 - I thank the opposition for making it clear by its reaction that it has the same position as the New South Wales leader of the -  - I was thanking members of the Liberal Party in the parliament for making it very clear by their reaction to this question that they support the Barry O'Farrell position on school transparency and they do not believe that parents should have more information about what is happening in local schools. They are guffawing at transparency despite the fact that parents around the country want it. Perhaps their guffawing is to hide the fact that when they were in government they talked a lot about school transparency - and the member for Bradfield nods that, yes, as minister he talked a lot about it. The current Deputy Leader of the Opposition also talked a lot about it. But when they were ministers for education for the Liberal Party they got absolutely nothing done - not one thing achieved.In contrast to that I am pleased to be able to inform the House that this Friday, with education ministers from around the country, I will release the 2009 summary report of the national testing on literacy and numeracy. That will be followed on Monday the 14th with school education authorities starting to supply to parents reports on their individual students' performance. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is interjecting: 'That's a coalition program.' Well, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition might want to listen to this, a reform she could never achieve and could never have dreamed of achieving as minister for education: at the end of this year, through our new reporting requirements, we will assemble, school by school, transparency measures, including the results of the 2008 and 2009 national tests, and from early next year parents and community members around the country who care about education will be able to go online. They will be able to look at test results and other indicators for their local school, including school population, school resources and numbers of teachers, and compare them with schools in their local area and, importantly, they will be able to compare achievements with like schools around the country.I note that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has fallen into silence because, of course, she knows that, despite talking about transparency for over 12 years, this was a reform that would not be achieved by the Liberal -  - This is an important reform which will be available to parents and to those who care about education from the start of next year. These transparency measures will relate to our national partnerships for disadvantaged schools, schools that are underachieving; to our national partnerships on teacher quality, programs to bring the best teachers to the schools that need them the most and to pay them more for being in those schools; and to our program to ensure literacy and numeracy efforts are focused where they are needed the most.Unfortunately, the federal Liberal Party as a matter of policy is silent on all of these things and says absolutely nothing about them - not one policy, not one plan. The only stated view of the Liberal Party about these matters is Barry O'Farrell's view in New South Wales, and he has legislated to prevent parents in New South Wales getting access to this information through their daily newspapers. So, courtesy of the Liberal Party and Barry O'Farrell, this information, which is transparently available online, will not be available to New South Wales parents or citizens in the pages of their daily newspapers. I think that is a disgrace, and what is more disgraceful than that is that the federal Liberal Party is absolutely silent about it.</DOC>

 - I am delighted that the opposition have paid so much attention to that speech. I thought it was a pretty good speech at the time. It did not attract huge coverage, but we were in opposition, so I am delighted they paid so much attention - so much so that I would like to remind them of some of the other things that I referred to in that speech. I referred to the $457 million being spent on government advertising by the previous government in the space of 16 months. I referred to the outrageous regional rorts scandal, where vast sums of money were spent on trains that never existed, cheese factories that closed down before the grant was made and those kinds of things. I had some pretty soft targets to aim at in 2007 when I was talking about quality of government spending, I can tell you.The underlying point that I made there remains absolutely valid, and this government has been committed to improving the quality of government spending and to reducing the total amount of money that is spent on the processes of government. In the two budgets that we have brought down over the course of our time in office, we had $33 billion of savings over four years in the first budget, $22 billion of savings over four years in the second budget and, of course, very substantial ongoing savings mounting in this year's budget from a number of initiatives, particularly some of the indexation related initiatives, which will take time to build up. So I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition, who as a minister was the man who presided over the quintupling, from $2 million to $10 million, of a grant to a bloke who claimed he could make it rain, that he is in no position to hold forth on the quality of government spending and that he is particularly ill-advised to remind anybody of debates about the quality of government spending in 2007.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. This is an issue that I know every single member of this House and the Senate feels very strongly about. It is important that we pursue these issues every day of the year, but I want to raise particular matters today and this week. This week is National Child Protection Week and today is White Balloon Day. White Balloon Day is the day on which we particularly raise the very confronting issue of child sexual abuse. The theme for the day and in fact for the year is: 'Break the silence on child sexual assault. It's ALL WHITE to say no'. These are very difficult issues for everyone, particularly for the children who are victims of this terrible abuse. It is also National Child Protection Week. The theme this year for National Child Protection Week, a similar theme to that for White Balloon Day, is: 'Help bring child abuse out into the open'. Once again, it is a job that we all have a responsibility to do to make sure that we raise public awareness of the terrible levels of child abuse and neglect taking place in our country.The stark facts are that in 2007-08 there were more than 55,000 substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect in our country. The level of substantiated abuse and neglect has in fact doubled over the last decade. The terrible facts are that Indigenous children are more than six times more likely to be the subject of abuse or neglect. It is important that we remember these are not just figures in a report. Each and every one of them reflects a child that has been either neglected or abused.This is a national problem and one that requires us to show national leadership. For the first time we now have a national child protection framework. We are working with the state and territory authorities and with the non-government sector to do everything we can to protect children in our country. One of the things that we have moved to do quickly is to improve information sharing between the Commonwealth and state child protection authorities. One of the things I have announced just this week is that Medicare Australia can now provide information to state child protection authorities. This could be medical information that could be useful to foster carers as they go about the very important job of meeting the health needs of children in their care. It could also be used by child protection authorities that are building a case against abusive parents. Those authorities will now have access to medical records that may show evidence of abuse.These Medicare arrangements will build on the success of the information sharing that we have already begun between Centrelink and child protection authorities. There have been more than 2,000 requests for information from Centrelink to child protection authorities, and this protocol only began in January this year. This information from Centrelink can be used to help child protection workers locate families where children are at risk of harm and stop vulnerable children from falling through the gaps when families, for example, move interstate.I take this opportunity to thank the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, otherwise known as NAPCAN, for their leadership and the work that they do to run Child Protection Week. Also, yesterday we had Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston here to help us mark White Balloon Day. She was joined by many members and senators and, most importantly, officers from the police force and other emergency services - people who are so important in helping all of us with the critical job of protecting our children.</DOC>

 - First, any allegations about fraud or misuse of pension entitlements are matters that should be referred to Centrelink. Second, any questions about the propriety of donations are ultimately matters for, in that case, the state secretary of the Labor Party. I am not aware of the detail of the report, but ultimately it is a matter for the organisation that is responsible for the donation. Therefore, it is a matter for the party organisation as to whether there is anything untoward with respect to the donation. It is certainly not something that I as minister for finance have a role in directly investigating.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lowe for his question. This is a very exciting program which is delivering important community infrastructure projects right around the nation. Indeed, my attention has been drawn to comments about Mirrabooka Regional Centre in Perth. The comments include:The City of Stirling is seeking $5.1 million in funding from the federal Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program for strategic projects to assist with building new infrastructure around the Mirrabooka Regional Centre. The project will see significant economic benefits flow through to the immediate and surrounding communities.That is a worthy statement. It goes on to say:Implementation of the project is projected to provide 870 jobs and support 1,800 jobs long term.This person goes on to say:I strongly urge the government to provide funding of at least $5.1 million towards the Mirrabooka Regional Centre.The council only wants $5.1 million, but Michael Keenan, the member for Stirling, wants at least $5.1 million for this program. I table the progress report from the member for Stirling campaigning in his electorate for funding for this project. Indeed, he is pretty hands-on. The member for North Sydney has said that if you have voted against projects you are morally obliged to not show up and say that you support them. But the member for Stirling does not have that view. He turned up to applaud the opening of the project just last week. -  - There it is - the Nation Building Program sign and all in the background - and he is applauding that project. But the member for Stirling goes a step further. The member for Stirling wants to build the project himself. He is out there with the hammer building the project himself, putting a hammer through the credibility of the arguments of those opposite. And, if a hammer is not enough, he has a jackhammer. -  - I will put the other photos up on the website. They will all be there because they are terrific photos. What this illustrates is the serious point that those opposite say one thing in their electorates. Last week they were out there - the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer - saying that this was all wasteful, that the stimulus should be withdrawn, but when they go into their seats they are arguing for extra funding. I was in the electorates of coalition members last week at the invitation of coalition members, asking them to look at projects for the next round. They have a view that they can get away with arguing one thing in here but another thing in their electorates. They will not get away with it. Senator Fielding might have had a problem in spelling 'fiscal', but I can spell out of touch: T-u-r-n-b-u-l-l.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Warringah for his question. As I outlined to him yesterday, in fact 102 houses have been built since the last election. Of course, those opposite do not want to hear that because when you compare the number of houses that were built by the Liberal government -  -  - As I was saying, the reason they do not want to hear that 102 houses have been built since the last election is that, when they were last in government, in 2004-05 there were 94 houses built and in 2005-06 only 51 houses were built. These are the relevant comparisons for how many houses were built over a similar period of time. But the member for Warringah asked me what some of this money has been spent on so far, and it gives me the opportunity to outline what some of the money has been spent on. I will first go to the important scoping works -  -  - Plainly, those opposite have never been involved in building a house and thinking about what the scoping works are that have to be done before any house is built in any part of Australia. Has the shadow minister ever been responsible for building a house? Plainly not, because some of the money that has been provided so far has gone to make sure that we assess the state of houses that currently exist so that we know what level of refurbishment is needed. The availability of serviced blocks has had to be pursued so we can make sure that blocks are ready for houses to be built on. The training needs of the local community have been pursued so that local people can get construction jobs. -  - I hear those opposite laughing about this - plainly, they have never taken any responsibility for making sure that local Aboriginal people have the chance to get a job as these houses get built.There has been the design work; design, of course, is a necessary part of scoping work that is done before a house is built. All of this is a necessary part of the work that happens before any house is built in any part of Australia. All of this is vital work that is done properly at the start of a program to make sure that we avoid problems down the track.I might also let those opposite know that some of this money has also been spent on the upgrades of power infrastructure. Of course, not only do those opposite think it is not necessary to do any design work or any other scoping work but, plainly, they do not think it is necessary to make sure that we have the power supplies available for these houses to be built in these remote parts of Australia.This is where that money has gone. I have, of course, indicated to those opposite before this question was asked that I have had very serious concerns about the delays in the Northern Territory. That is why the Commonwealth has decided to take the unusual step of putting Commonwealth officers into this program. We will put Commonwealth officers into this program on a permanent basis. They will also be part of the alliance process to make sure the 750 houses that will be built are built on time and on budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. This week it is good to be able to celebrate the work of more than 100,000 Landcare volunteers in something in the order of 4½ thousand community groups around the nation. Three-quarters of all Australian farmers are involved in some way in Landcare, and these are the people who manage 70 per cent of our landscape.This year also marks two decades since Landcare Australia began, originally under Minister Kerin and the late Peter Cook, and then followed on from 1990 by the then Minister for Agriculture, who is now the Minister for Trade, Simon Crean. It started as a partnership between the NFF and the Australian Conservation Foundation but now includes significant urban and peri-urban groups as well.When the community cabinet met in Lyne I had the opportunity to visit the Landcare Community Nursery in Port Macquarie, where volunteers are replacing invasive species with local native plants to support a wildlife corridor and to repair flood damage. For some time MPs, including the member for Corangamite, have raised with me the need for a return to a small grants program within Landcare and within Caring for our Country. I am very pleased that earlier today the Minister for the Environment and I were able to announce $5 million to bring back a small grants program which will allow small grants between $5,000 and $20,000 for natural resource management groups, including Landcare groups, under Caring for our Country.Members may be aware that yesterday was National Threatened Species Day, and much of the work of Caring for our Country goes to threatened species. Threatened species have descriptions such as vulnerable, critically endangered and extinct in the wild - all of which prompted me to think about the National Party! Something that has these listings is terribly hard to find, but last week four National Parties travelled together so they would be easier to find and vox pops were asked on this question in Lismore: is Warren Truss or Barnaby Joyce Leader of the Nationals? The first person who got it right -  - On the topic of whether or not they were regarded as endangered species, the final person on the vox pop got it right: Emma Adams from Tabulam said, 'The Nationals' leader is Warren Truss,' and then added, 'No, I don't have any interest in politics, I just guessed it.'Endangered species do have a higher recognition rating than the Leader of the Nationals, but compare that with the recognition throughout the country of Landcare in its logo, its volunteers and on our landscape.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It is important, because it goes to the government's nation building for recovery plan in response to the worst global recession in 75 years. We do note the Liberal Party's continuing opposition to supporting jobs during a global recession, and also its continuing opposition to supporting the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history.The Leader of the Opposition has asked me a specific question, so I will answer it with some facts. The Building the Education Revolution component of our nation-building plan is supporting 24,000 individual projects that have been approved in around 9,500 schools across the country. These projects, of course, are benefiting students and supporting local jobs. More than 12,500 projects are underway and more than 400 projects are already completed, delivering tens of thousands of jobs around the nation.These unprecedented efforts to support these jobs are being coordinated by coordinators at the national level and the public servants who support them, by the leaders of the Catholic and independent school authorities and by coordinators at state and territory government levels and the public servants who support them. I would like to thank the people across state, independent and Catholic education authorities who have worked so hard on this program that is vital to supporting jobs today and also supporting the nation's productive future.On the question of the Abbotsford Public School, which the Leader of the Opposition has raised with me, I can advise him of the following facts. The proposal about the development at the school was accepted by the school community on 25 May. That is, they endorsed the proposal that came from the New South Wales government, as the responsible education authority, through to the national government. So it was accepted by the school on 25 May. In terms of the proposal itself, it is about demolishing a building that was constructed -  - I am talking about the school community's attitude to the proposal on 25 May. Then, in terms of the description of the proposal, the proposal is about demolishing a building from the 1950s, which is in poor condition, and giving a building in its place which, of course, would be a great improvement in terms of standards.I note that there was some reference in today's media reports about a covered outdoor learning area. That covered outdoor learning area is actually a program from the Building Better Schools program of the state government; it is not a Building the Education Revolution project. The Building the Education Revolution project is constructing the new building to replace the 1950s building, which is in poor condition.I understand from media reports today - in the Australian newspaper, I believe - that there is concern in the school community about this, although the school community made a decision about it on 25 May. In circumstances where there is concern in the school community, obviously we are very keen to hear about their concerns. The best way, and the way that has been used by other school communities to indicate concerns and to have them looked at, is by emailing our Building the Education Revolution coordinator. The email address is ber@deewr.gov.au.I can advise the Leader of the Opposition, in case he is interested, that during the course of the Building the Education Revolution program - more than 24,000 projects in around 9,500 schools - 49 complaints have been received to date. Of course, those 49 complaints have and are being dealt with.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. As a Tasmanian member of this place, I know that she and other members are acutely concerned about the impact of the global recession in all states in Australia and across her state as well, and what practical actions can be taken to reduce the impact of the global recession.There have been a number of releases of data over the last 24 hours which show that, while Australia is continuing to weather the storm of the global economic recession better than most economies, we are by no means out of the woods yet. Overnight and today the new Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment report was released, dated 9 September. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment rose by 5.2 per cent in September to its highest level since July 2007. To quote the Westpac Chief Economist, Bill Evans, 'This is a truly extraordinary result.'Consumer sentiment is 34.4 per cent higher over the last four months. The consumer sentiment is now 45.4 per cent higher than October 2008, when the government announced its first economic stimulus package. The September result, of course, is attributed by Westpac to relief on the part of consumers that the economy has avoided recession and that expected job losses have not materialised - although, as I think the Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday, we are still deeply concerned about the further loss of jobs in Australia because of the impact of that recession.It is worthwhile also putting into context where consumer sentiment lies here relative to other economies around the world. Confidence in Australia has been above total OECD consumer confidence in each month since the announcement of the government's stimulus strategy last October. Furthermore, according to the latest Nielsen Global Confidence Survey released in July, Australia's consumer confidence is the fifth highest globally and higher than that of any of the other major advanced economies.I said before that there is data out today which underpins the fact that Australia is weathering the global economic recession better than most other economies but also there is data which has come out, which represents a wake-up call to the Leader of the Opposition, the Liberal Party and the National Party about how difficult the road to recovery actually is. For any party to celebrate the early withdrawal of stimulus would quickly turn into a wake for Australia's economic recovery. As we see in today's retail data and housing finance data, we still have a long road ahead and the government stimulus strategy, through our infrastructure strategy, is a key element of making sure that we get there in the end.I referred just now to the ABS retail data. I inform the House that in the month of July the value of retail trade fell by one per cent and in the same month housing finance also fell by 2.3 per cent. These are sobering facts for Australia, which indicate that we have a long, long way to go in terms of charting the course to economic recovery.This data underpins the need for our nation building for recovery and our nation building for the future strategy - a strategy, which is, so far, working. But we have a long way to go. Our strategy is about supporting jobs, small business and apprenticeships today by investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. As a result of the strategy, Australia is the only one of the 33 developed economies of the OECD to have registered positive economic growth over the last year, it is the fastest growing economy of the major advanced economies, it is the second lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies, it has the lowest debt and deficit of the major economies and it is the only one so far not to have gone into recession.Government policy has had an impact here. Critically, the decisions by business and small business have also had a huge impact in registering a better performance in this economy relative to others which have been buffered by the global economic crisis. -  - Those opposite constantly interject. I would ask them to reflect simply on what the growth numbers for the last 12 months have been for the major advanced economies. The Japanese economy contracted 6.4 per cent, the UK economy contracted 5.5 per cent, the US economy contracted 3.9 per cent, the Canadian economy contracted 3.2 per cent, France was down 2.6 per cent, Germany was down 5.9 per cent, Italy was down six per cent, the G7 average contracted 4.6 per cent, the OECD average across 33 economies contracted by 4.6 per cent and the Australian economy grew by 0.6 per cent.Why is it so hard for those opposite to say anything positive about the performance of the Australian economy? The government's economic strategy has been supported by the Treasury; it is supported by the Reserve Bank of Australia; it is supported by national peak industry bodies - for example, ACCI was referred to yesterday by the finance minister; it is supported by public economists across the country, it is supported by each of the G20 economies; it is supported by the IMF; and it is supported by the World Bank.There was a further contribution to debate today, a further development, which was the appearance at the doors of the member for Fadden, otherwise known as the 'brains trust' of the Liberal Party. The brains trust of the Liberal Party was out there at the direction of the Leader of the Opposition to reveal new truths about Liberal Party policy on the economy. What did the brains trust of the Liberal Party have to say on the doors today? Here is what he had to say:_ every other government in the world except for Mr Rudd and Labor, is actually winding back stimulus.I presume that was the instruction from the dispatch box, from the advisers and from the Leader of the Opposition - to say:_ every other government in the world except Mr Rudd and Labor, is actually winding back stimulus.It is a pity that those opposite occasionally do not read the odd report which comes from offshore because there was a communique out a couple of days ago at the G20 finance ministers meeting in London, which had this to say on behalf of the 20 largest economies in the world:We will continue to implement decisively our necessary financial support measures and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, consistent with price stability and long-term fiscal sustainability, until recovery is secured.We have got the member for Fadden out there, representing the new orthodoxy on the part of those opposite, saying that, mysteriously, all these other governments around the world are reining their stimulus strategies in - except that the central bank governors and the finance ministers of the 20 largest economies of the world have said, in fact, 'We have got to keep going because the recovery is not secure.'I say this to the Leader of the Opposition before he dispatches the brains trust to the doors again, because we know how strongly he articulates the Liberal Party line handed to him on a sheet every morning. He will walk out there - a bit like walking up there to face the shrapnel each day - and deliver the line faithfully, except that he did not bother to actually read what was on it before he read it out. Here are a few basic things for those opposite to understand. Fact No. 1: the world is currently facing its most difficult recession in 75 years. Fact No. 2: the global economies, the G20, do not regard us collectively as being out of the woods yet, and the full consequences of this recession have not yet been reflected in the unemployment numbers. Fact No. 3: major economies around the world are not pulling the rug from under economic recovery by prematurely stopping their stimulus; they are in fact implementing their stimulus strategies. Fact No. 4, for the benefit of the member for Fadden, is that Elvis is not alive and well flipping burgers in Mississippi in a roadside diner run by the member for Fadden. The Leader of the Opposition lacks judgment; we all know that. The Leader of the Opposition now demonstrates himself to have lacked judgment on the economy. It is time they got with the national program.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. Of course, his question, like the first question by the Leader of the Opposition, relates to the government's nation-building plan for recovery, to our support for jobs during the worst global recession in 75 years and to the biggest school modernisation program this nation has ever seen. I note the continued opposition of the Liberal Party to the more than 24,000 projects in around 9,500 schools that are being delivered through this program in order to support jobs today, during the worst global recession in 75 years, whilst engaging in the biggest school modernisation program the nation has ever seen. I say to the shadow minister: the shadow minister would be aware that the Building the Education Revolution program works through education authorities. It works through the Catholic education authority, and I thank them for their efforts in delivering this program to schools. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Of course, the reason I was going to the question of education authorities is that - although the shadow minister for education may not fully appreciate this - the Commonwealth government does not own or operate schools. What the Commonwealth government does - a fact that has clearly escaped his attention in the time that he has been shadow education minister - is to deal with education authorities. We deal with the Catholic education authority for the Catholic sector, we deal with independent education authorities for independent schools and we deal with state and territory government education authorities for state schools. Of course, the Evesham State School is operated by the Queensland Department of Education and Training on behalf of the Queensland government. Consequently, all discussions about amalgamations of this school - or indeed any other school, whether it is in the state system, the Catholic system or the independent system - would be conducted by those relevant education authorities. - As I am advised by the Queensland Department of Education and Training, the Evesham State School is located in the Central West Education District. It was opened in 1967. The nearest schools are the Longreach State School, some 72 kilometres away; the Muttaburra State School, 118 kilometres away; and the Winton State School, 124 kilometres away. So they are at quite some distance. - The Queensland department advises me that the sudden drop in enrolments was unpredicted and related to a set of personal circumstances relating to families at that school. The Queensland department commenced formal consultation on the viability of the school, so those consultation arrangements are obviously in train. The Queensland department advises me that obviously they are concerned about this circumstance but they want to work through it with the community, particularly in circumstances where this drop in enrolments was not predicted. So those things are being managed by the Queensland department of education, as is appropriate, on behalf of the Queensland government. If a similar circumstance arose in the Catholic sector, it would be managed by the relevant Catholic education authority. If it arose in the independent sector, it would be managed by the independent education authority. When we set up the Building the Education Revolution program, we were obviously aware that schools do close and amalgamate, so the guidelines and arrangements for Building the Education Revolution can cater for such a circumstance and have catered for such a circumstance around the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question because last weekend in London I met with G20 finance ministers to discuss the full implementation of all of our commitments that were agreed to at the April summit. I think it is pretty clear that there has been a fair bit accomplished by the G20 over the past six to 12 months. One of the most significant accomplishments of the G20 over that period of time has been to put in place coordinated economic stimulus which has averted an economic catastrophe and it is the case that if it had not been for that coordinated stimulus the world economy would have been in a far worse condition than it is now. It is the case that finance ministers believe that we are not out of the woods yet and, until there are signs of a sustained return of private demand, stimulus must be implemented. So Australia has a lot at stake in this process because we are outperforming the rest of the world, something that seems irrelevant to those sitting opposite. But we are not immune to what is going on elsewhere in the world. There is a lot of hard work to be done to ensure that we can cushion our economy from the impact of this global recession.It is pretty true to say that every finance minister in the G20 understands just how fragile the global economy is, something not understood by those opposite. This is the view of those internationally. Let us just look at the view of the IMF. Director Strauss-Kahn said:While global growth appears to have turned a corner, we should not forget that so far, this has been mainly due to massive policy support _                _            _            _Unwinding the stimulus too soon runs a real risk of derailing the recovery, with potentially significant implications for growth and unemployment.Let us go to what Tim Geithner, the US Treasury Secretary, had to say:The classic errors of economic policy during crises are that governments tend to act too late with insufficient force and then put the brakes on too early.We on this side of the House are determined not to make those mistakes. The UK Prime Minister said:To decide now that it is time to start withdrawing and reversing the exceptional measures we have taken would in my judgment be a serious mistake.Those are the views of three of the people sitting at the table over the weekend, and I would make the point that sitting at that table on the weekend were representatives and finance ministers from all sides and all ends of the political spectrum. There were conservatives sitting there; there were centre left governments sitting there. So how is it that everyone across the spectrum, across the globe, through the G20, agrees that stimulus must be maintained but that the only people in parliaments around the world who disagree are the Liberal Party of Australia? They are so out of touch. But it is worse than that. They simply do not understand the nature of the global challenge, and if they do not understand the nature of the global challenge they cannot be part of the solution. We had the farce on the door this morning of the member for Fadden. This is what the member for Fadden had to say:_ every other government in the world except for Mr Rudd and Labor, is actually winding back stimulus.He said that in spite of what had been decided at the G20 over the weekend. He said it despite all of the evidence of what stimulus has done in this economy to protect small business and to protect our people. If they had their way, this economy would be in recession right now and instead of a positive figure of 0.6 per cent for the year it would have been minus 1.3 per cent, hundreds of thousands of people out of work and businesses closing their doors.It is not just the governments of the world but also the business community. Those opposite are supposed to be the party of business, but on 8 September Peter Anderson, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, ACCI, said:_ the balance of risk supports the maintenance of most of the current fiscal and monetary policy stimulus._            _            _The underlying conditions facing Australian business remain weak __            _            _An in-built scaling down of economic support is preferable to sudden withdrawal.That is the government's policy. They are supporting the government's policy. The only ones who are one out here are the Liberal and National parties in this parliament. Why is that the case? Because they will always put their politics ahead of the national interest. They will always put their self-interest before the jobs of Australians because they are not capable of coming on board for a set of proposals which protect our national economic interests. That is what has become apparent since the meeting of G20 finance ministers on the weekend. They are out of touch, they are out of their depth and they do not understand the nature of the challenge facing this country.We on this side of the House will pursue the national economic interest. We will continue to support employment and business in the Australian economy. We understand the nature of the challenge. Business investment is weak. There has been a very substantial cut to our national income. Many businesses and employees are doing it tough and, while that is the case, we will continue to support them because that is in the national interest. The Liberal Party are operating in their own political self-interest, hoping that unemployment goes up, hoping that a withdrawal of stimulus will produce dramatic effects in the economy which will support their political objectives. We will move forward in the national interests and they should be condemned for their overtly political approach.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question because it enables me to explain something about the Building the Education Revolution program that he obviously does not understand. The Building the Education Revolution program has three components: Primary Schools for the 21st Century, the National School Pride Program and the Science and Language Learning Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools. The science and languages centres funding was applied for by schools in a competitive funding round. Funding for the other two programs - Primary Schools for the 21st Century and the National School Pride Program - was not applied for by schools; there was not an application process. The shadow minister may want to go back to the very first announcement of this program, and when he does he will find that when we announced the program we said we would work with education authorities to disburse the funds.That seems to be resulting in some great hilarity amongst opposition members, but that is exactly the process that is used when the Commonwealth disburses recurrent funding to schools. When the Commonwealth disburses recurrent funding we disburse it through education authorities. So exactly the same process that was used to disburse funds to schools each and every year when the Howard government was in office is being used. That is, we deal with education authorities. We deal with the Catholic education authority to disburse money to Catholic schools, we deal with the independent education authority to disburse money to independent schools and we deal with state and territory government departments to disburse money to state and territory run schools.I do not know if the opposition's political case here is that the Catholic education authority cannot be trusted or the independent schools authorities cannot be trusted. I do not know what their political case is, but that is the way it works and that is the way it is working. We work with the education authorities to manage the program. The education authorities then consult and work with local schools on their needs and material comes through those education authorities to our Building the Education Revolution coordinator and, of course, the public servants who work with our Building the Education Revolution coordinator, as is a proper process.On the question of the Evesham State School, the situation here - and I would have thought anybody just bringing some common sense to bear would quickly understand this - is that this has for many years been a very small school. Obviously other state schools are geographically quite far away. There was an unexpected drop in enrolments to one student this year. Clearly, that requires some decisions to be made about the future of the school. I am advised by the Queensland education department that the local community believes that factors like drought have impacted the number of families in the region and the number of children in the school. Those things are obviously worked through and consulted about at local levels, and that is happening now. On the $250,000 amount that the shadow minister refers to, of course that will not be used for a facility at the school whilst these discussions about the school's future are in progress.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The government stimulus package has helped employment and economic growth in the most difficult economic environment we have faced since the Great Depression. Important in this is consumer and investor confidence. The House will recall the numerous guest lectures from the Leader of the Opposition about the importance of consumer and investor confidence when confidence was falling. He has been strangely silent on this issue more recently and I cannot think why that might be the case. It might be because consumer confidence in Australia has increased by 46 per cent since October 2008, prior to the announcement of the government's first fiscal stimulus package. This compares to an increase around the world and the OECD of two per cent over the same period.Today I can inform the House of indicators of investor confidence that are also responding to Australia's economic performance and the government stimulus package. The Investment and Financial Services Association today released the Quarterly Investor Sentiment Research Report, a survey taken across 700 different investors. In the first quarter of this year the index stood at minus 22.3 per cent. It now stands at positive five per cent for the third quarter.It would be foolish for anyone to declare victory in the war against the economic crisis. It would be foolish and negligent in the extreme to declare that we can pull the rug from underneath the recovery and withdraw the stimulus. There are significant challenges that lie ahead, and these are underlined in some data out today. The housing finance figures and the retail trade figures out today indicate that there are still very significant challenges ahead for the Australian economy. To keep the unemployment rate steady it is necessary to create around 20,000 jobs per month and grow the economy at around three per cent a year - a huge challenge in this international environment. This underlines the need for the stimulus package to remain in place.To declare victory and withdraw the stimulus is actually to concede defeat on unemployment, to say 0.6 per cent growth is enough, consigning thousands of Australians to an unemployment rate higher than that which is unavoidable. This is not just the government's view; this is also the view of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, not an organisation necessarily famous for supporting government intervention. Yesterday the chief executive of ACCI said:_ there are considerable downside risks to any sudden or immediate withdrawal of the economic stimulus measures.That recovery is not yet here. Therefore, those economic stimulus measures need to be maintained.Perhaps it has been said best by Craig James, the chief economist with CommSec, who said:The stimulus put in place by government spending and low interest rates has certainly done the trick of insulating the economy from global doom, but it is too early to declare victory.While Australia is doing better than any other developed economy, we are still well below where the government would want to be and where as a nation we need to be in relation to long-term trend growth. It is far too early to declare victory in the fight to support jobs and economic growth.I was very interested to hear the Leader of the Opposition declaring victory on the economic front. He is a bit like an armchair general a thousand miles behind the front line: he has opposed all previous attacks for the economy and now he declares victory. 'We've won,' he says, when he did not turn up to the battle. He says, 'It's all over; the war's over.' The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer are engaged in a very tricky political manoeuvre. I like to call it the reverse 'I told you so'. They have gone from arguing that the stimulus would never work to arguing that it has worked too well and now must be withdrawn. These guys make Janus look consistent. They lurch from saying, 'Why isn't the government acting?' to 'Why is the government acting?' They go from saying, 'The economy will be unaffected by the stimulus' to 'The stimulus is overheating the economy.' They go from beating their chests and saying, 'We'll have nothing to do with this deficit-financed investment,' to saying, 'Where do we get the invitation to the library opening?' They go from saying, 'This will all overheat the economy,' to saying, 'Make sure you get my good side at the photo opportunity at the opening.' They go from the ridiculous to the sublime, and today we saw the worst of it, with the revelation of the Robert doctrine, which says -  - I do tend to agree that the member for Fadden is normally irrelevant, but he is relevant today because we see the Robert doctrine, which says, 'If you cannot find a fact to support your argument, just make one up.' - Those opposite should start voting and talking the way they position themselves at infrastructure photo shoots - that is, in support of the government's stimulus package, continuing to support jobs and, most importantly, underwriting our continued economic recovery.</DOC>

 - I will endeavour to explain this to the shadow minister as clearly as I can. If he had been interested in the way these programs worked, he could have learnt about it from the very first day that they were announced by the Prime Minister and me, when the nation building for recovery plan was announced earlier this year. -  - I am just explaining the three elements of the program for the shadow minister. He asked me about them. I am presuming that he is interested in the answer. With respect to science and language centres, schools individually applied, went into a competitive round, an independent panel assessed who was going to be successful and 537 schools were successful. In contrast, when the government announced the National School Pride Program and the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, we said that they would run out in correlation with school size and we would manage the process through education authorities.We worked through education authorities for the three rounds of Primary Schools for the 21st Century and for the rounds for the National School Pride Program. We managed them through authorities rather than having individual school based applications sent to the federal government. The shadow minister obviously would be aware that, in working with the Catholic education system, the independent schools system and with state and territory governments, we managed the programs through those authorities. They then worked with school communities. The school communities identified projects, and the projects went through in three rounds for the primary schools and in a number of rounds for the National School Pride Program.I would have thought that that was fairly clear and easy to understand. The shadow minister then asked me about costing assumptions in relation to Primary Schools for the 21st Century. As I have explained, in the management system I have just described the costing assumption was that there would be a 90 per cent take-up - that is, as we managed through school authorities and they -  - The shadow minister just called out: 'But you're giving them the money!' That is what he misunderstands. When I say 'managed through school authorities', I mean we worked with school authorities to consult with school communities and feed in project details. That is why it was appropriate to make an assumption about take-up - how many schools would choose to participate through their education authorities.When we come back to the basics, working with people of goodwill, Catholic education offices around the country support the program and their schools support the program. When we work with the independent school system, they support the program and their schools support the program. When we work with state and territory governments, and they work with state schools, they support the program - including the Liberal government of Western Australia - and their schools support the program. At the end of the day, the shadow minister can come into this House and ask the kinds of questions he is asking, but he knows, and the members of the Liberal Party who talk to us and go to their local schools know, that this is being grabbed by schools with both hands as a great opportunity to modernise school facilities and support jobs in the local community. This is part of the nation's response to the global recession: supporting jobs today. It is the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. It is part of modernising schools for this nation's future.</DOC>

 - Are there any impediments! I thank the member for Fowler for her question. I can report on the retail sales figures that were released this morning. They indicate that the retail sales for the month of July actually fell by one per cent, which follows a contraction of 0.8 per cent in June. I can, though, put this in some perspective. Retail sales since November last year - that is, the pre-stimulus period - have in fact grown by 4.8 per cent. That sets us apart from the rest of the developed world because in the rest of the developed world retail sales have contracted in that period.What it really means is that we need to take a reality check on the economic situation in this country. Yes, there are encouraging signs. Yes, there are positive signs in the consumer confidence figures that were released today. But we know how fragile consumer and business confidence is. We need to do everything that we possibly can to back in that consumer and business confidence and thereby prepare for the recovery. That is the view of just about every respected commentator in Australia and overseas. In fact, yesterday I cited no fewer than 13 examples of institutions and organisations overseas and here in Australia who say that a premature withdrawal of stimulus would be precipitant, reckless and irresponsible. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund said:Premature exit from accommodative monetary and fiscal policies is a principal concern.We have already heard the Treasurer refer to CommSec, who said, 'We wouldn't be advocating that the government or the Reserve Bank change their settings in any way at the moment.' The Commonwealth Bank chief economist, Michael Blythe, said: 'The Australian economy will continue to benefit from economic policy stimulus in 2009. We're not there yet.' An ANZ economist said, 'Government policy actions continue to be a critical factor supporting the economy.' They are just a few of the 13 organisations overseas and in Australia who say it would be reckless and irresponsible to withdraw stimulus.But of course there are different views, and the different views have been articulated today straight off the script issued by the Leader of the Opposition's office. The member for Fadden, the Gomer Pyle of Australian politics, stood up and said: 'Gol-lee! Gol-lee, Sergeant! The rest of the Western world right now is lookin' at how to wind back stimulus. Stimulus is all about puttin' government money in where private sector money comes out.' - 'Well, as private sector money is goin' back in, every other government in the world, except for Mr Rudd and Labor, is actually windin' back the stimulus.' Andy Warhol once said that everyone will have 15 minutes of fame. Well, brother, this is your 15 minutes of fame - the Gomer Pyle of Australian politics. But you did not write the script; we know that. It is not your fault - well, not entirely. You walked out with a script from the opposition leader's office without reading it. - I will, Mr Speaker. When I was looking up various news reports for commentary on the retail sales figures about which I have commented just now, I noticed a report. You might remember, Mr Speaker, that earlier in the week I likened the opposition leader to Major Tom, an astronaut circling around the world isolated on the issue of stimulus. But he is not exactly alone. I learned today that Buzz Lightyear has been circling the earth for more than a year in the International Space Station. Do you how long he has been circling the earth? Four hundred and sixty-seven days, which is the number of days since the shadow minister for small business last asked me a question. Up Buzz Lightyear went into the atmosphere after I got that last question - two days later. I urge the Leader of the Opposition to come back to earth with Buzz Lightyear, get away from the isolation of the upper stratosphere, support the Rudd government, support the Rudd government's stimulus package, support small business -  - support the Australian economy and support Australian workers. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As the member may be aware, the Building the Education Revolution program, with more than 24,000 projects around the country at around 9,500 schools, is there to support jobs today whilst building the school infrastructure we need for tomorrow. He has drawn to my attention in this parliament two quotes he says he is familiar with from two schools for identical projects. Obviously I do not have with me sitting here in this parliament the project specifications and designs of the more than 24,000 projects authorised under this program. However, if he believes that there is a problem with the provision of tenders and quotes in relation to any school then obviously we want to hear about that. If any school has raised an issue with him and he wishes to raise it directly with me, I am very happy for that to happen. If the school community wants to raise it then the school community can raise it, as I have said, through the email address at my website.As I have said, during the life of a program that has more than 24,000 projects at around 9,500 schools we have received 49 complaints. When those complaints are received, obviously we work to address them. If the member has information that he believes it is important for the government to have, particularly when it relates to something as detailed as whether or not the actual building projects are identical, which he claims - and I am not dismissing what the member says, but obviously I would want to see the building plans and the full details - I would be more than happy to work it through with him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. It is instructive, if you want to understand the challenges facing Australia's economy in the medium term, to look back to the time when this government took office. We had experienced in this country 10 interest rate rises in a row under the stewardship of a government that had promised to keep interest rates at record lows, and over several years the Reserve Bank had warned Australians on no less than 20 occasions about capacity constraints in the Australian economy, in our skills capabilities and in our infrastructure, all of which were putting upward pressure on interest rates, both short and long term. It is also instructive to recall that in the middle of a mining boom we inherited a budget with settings for spending growth at five per cent in real terms and all kinds of extraordinary spending horrors, ranging from $457 million being spent over 16 months on government advertising and the Regional Partnerships scandal to smaller and more spectacular rorts like $350,000 being committed to subsidise the private gift of an ornate carriage to the Queen by an ordinary Australian citizen.During that period Labor consistently warned about the need for Australia to lift its game on productivity, to lift its game on infrastructure and to lift its game on skills, and from the moment we took office we have been resolutely focused on these challenges, firmly focused on the holy grail of reviving Australia's productivity performance. It is true that that challenge has been complicated by the global financial crisis and by the global recession that has battered Australia in recent months, but we have never taken our eye off that challenge. All of the government's primary efforts in the economic sphere, including our stimulus strategy, are ultimately directed to that goal, to nation-building for the future - huge investments in road, rail and ports; a big program of investment in higher education; a big injection of funding into early childhood, into schools, into technical education; a very large new program in innovation and research; and, of course, an ambitious regulatory reform agenda to deliver a seamless national economy by harmonising economic regulation across Australia.Unfortunately, instead of learning from their mistakes in government - on productivity, on exports, on infrastructure, on skills - the opposition seem intent on moving into weirder and weirder economic positions. Yesterday we heard the member for Sturt declare that the global economic crisis is over, and today we have heard the member for Fadden state that every government in the world apart from Australia's is winding back its stimulus strategy. They do appear to be living in a parallel universe. Pretty soon they will be denying that the global financial crisis even happened. As well as climate change deniers on the other side, we will have GFC deniers as well. The GFC will be something that was faked in a Hollywood studio - like the moon landing! That is where they are heading. That is where they are moving.For those in the community who may be tempted to question the Liberal Party's capabilities on economic issues, for those who are prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt as to whether they are a viable alternative government and not just behaving like a minority in the Senate, I would urge you to ask them a few questions, Mr Speaker, and they are questions of this kind -  - I am delighted that the member for North Sydney has dragged himself away from his twittering for a few moments. We know he has got an attention span problem, but it would be good if he actually paid attention to the parliament rather than sitting there twittering all day. We should ask the opposition: when they were in government why was it that they inherited productivity running on average, over five years, at above three per cent and when they left government the figure was one per cent? Why on their watch did Australia slip way behind most of the developed world on broadband? Why under their stewardship was Australia the only developed nation in the world where public investment in higher education went backwards? Why over their time in office was no effort made to get uniform national regulatory arrangements in occupational health and safety, in trade licences, in consumer laws and all those other areas where they did absolutely nothing? We know the answer to these questions. The answer is that they have learnt nothing from their time in office. The government is committed to that holy grail of productivity improvement, to fixing productivity in this country, and that is what all of our economic efforts are directed to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mayo for his question, and I note that he represents in this parliament an electorate with 73 schools and 212 Building the Education Revolution projects valued at more than $117 million. Despite his having voted against this program in this parliament, we are of course supporting jobs in his local community in South Australia while modernising the schools he purports to represent in this parliament. The member has raised with me, as part of our program, the three campuses of the Kangaroo Island community centre, the schools on Kangaroo Island. As I understand it, that is what he has raised with me. In raising that with me, I am sure he would understand that he is referring to three projects that are part of more than 24,000 projects at around 9,500 schools.In relation to those three projects, their total value is $3.7 million. There is a project at Kingscote, for $2 million; a project at Penneshaw, a well known holiday destination in South Australia - I was there for school holidays myself once - which is valued at $850,000; and a project at Parndana, for $800,000. Each of these is for a multipurpose hall, and originally it was indicated that a standard design template would be used. However, because the local schools determined that they would prefer to use a non-standard design for their projects, architects were engaged to do the drawings. I understand the force of the member's question to be that he believes the architects engaged - from Mount Gambier, I think he said - have not charged appropriately for their work. He obviously believes they have charged more than the work is worth.If the member believes that to be the case and he wants the matter investigated, clearly we are happy to investigate it. I would obviously want him to supply to me the details he apparently has of the drawings. So, should he want to forward the drawings to me so that I can see evidence of the claims he has made about the quality of the drawings and whether or not the drawings are original or are of some sort of standard nature, I would obviously look at that and get back to him. If he would prefer, he can advise the schools on Kangaroo Island that they can deal direct with our Building the Education Revolution coordinator through the email address at my departmental website. I would indicate to him that this is a course that has been taken by 49 other schools out of around 9,500 schools which have had complaints - 49 out of around 9,500 - and the complaints that have been raised have been addressed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question and for her ongoing interest in health reforms. The Rudd government's health budget this year was all about laying the groundwork for reforming our health system: delivering better services to the community, funding new drugs and expanding successful programs but also making programs fairer and more sustainable in the long term. Unfortunately, the opposition do not seem to have made that connection between funding new programs and demanding that existing ones are fair, are delivering to patients and are providing best value for taxpayer dollars. We all know that health dollars are always scarce and, as the Health Reform Commission has said, business as usual is no longer an option. So the limited funding that we have must be targeted to ensure we get the best bang for our buck. The government believes we owe it to taxpayers to ensure that their hard-earned dollars are being used wisely and support goes to those in the community who need it most.Yet the government's measures that are doing just that are being blocked by the opposition. Our changes to ensure that patients, not specialists, get the benefits of taxpayer support are being opposed. Our changes that ensure that we are supporting secretaries who want to take out private health insurance rather than supporting the CEOs who expect us to pay for their private health insurance are also being opposed. We do want to adjust the fees that are paid for cataracts to better reflect the time, true cost and complexity of procedures. But the opposition, instead of arguing for the protection of patients or for taxpayers, want to protect ophthalmologists. - The member for O'Connor is interjecting. I know he is particularly interested in people of a certain age needing these cataract procedures, which I understand. What I would like to explain to the member for O'Connor and all members in this House is that, even if our cataract changes are accepted, ophthalmologists will earn, not as their income but just from the Medicare rebates, over half a million dollars on average every year from Medicare, after our cataract changes are supported. But the opposition still want to protect those ophthalmologists, who are going to earn more than half a million dollars a year on average just from Medicare - not from co-payments, not from health insurance, not from private payments.It is time, we believe, that taxpayers are able to enjoy the dividends that new medical technology and new treatments have brought to patient care in recent years. The opposition cannot expect taxpayers to keep supporting new items and new medicines if they are then blocked from enjoying the benefits and savings that flow from new technology. Nearly $2.5 billion of money that could be better used in health is currently being blocked by the Liberal Party in the Senate. -  - Perhaps those who are interjecting opposite might want to tell us which programs the Liberal Party wants us to stop funding so that they can actually move these measures. Do they want to remove the cancer drug avastin from the PBS, a measure that was only introduced in the budget because these savings measures were expected to be delivered? Perhaps the Liberal Party do not want to fund new regional cancer centres that were promised in the budget. Perhaps they should ask their colleagues in the National Party whether not funding those regional cancer centres is a good idea. Or perhaps the rural health package is what they have got in their sights.Back at budget time the shadow Treasurer made clear that each and every measure in the budget would be supported with the exception of private health insurance. All of them would be supported. But now we see that the member for Dickson is not backing the shadow Treasurer. It also seems he is not backing the leader. Yesterday he held a press conference at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition, in competition with the Leader of the Opposition. He is not backing sensible health reform, he is not backing sustainability in the health system; he is certainly not backing the constituents in Dickson as he runs off to try for another seat on the Gold Coast. I do have one suggestion for what it seems possible that the member for Dickson is backing, and that is found at Sandown today, horse number 7, race 7. The name of the horse: Cut and Run. That is what the member for Dickson is backing. - It is time for the member for Dickson to back sensible reform, it is time for the member for Dickson to back sustainable reform and it is time for the member for Dickson to start backing his leader and telling those in the Senate to back our budget measures, as they promised in budget week.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and, to the Leader of the Opposition, he may be interested to know that in his own local electorate there are 43 schools, 103 projects worth $82 million -  - Ordinarily, it seems to me that members in this parliament are pretty proud to come into this parliament and represent their local schools and they are pretty proud to hear about developments in their local schools. That is certainly the attitude of this side of the House. Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition is made of different stuff and does not want to know about the more than $82 million going to 103 projects in his 43 local schools. On the question the Leader of the Opposition has asked me -  -  - If the allegation is that I am going to be repetitive talking about the benefits of this program to local schools, the answer is you betcha. On the question about the Evesham State School that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me, I made it clear in answer to an earlier question that no money will be spent at this school whilst it is in consultation about its future. That is a standard part of how the Building the Education Revolution program works. From the outset of this program we said we understand that education authorities - state, catholic, independent - work with school communities and from time to time schools open, schools close and schools amalgamate. That is an ordinary part of the way our education system works. If a school is facing closure or facing amalgamation, then education authorities would work through that process in their standard practice and obviously money would not be allocated and spent on school facilities in schools that are not going to be continuing as school facilities. We have had examples of that in this House in the past. Those examples have been raised by the opposition and I have explained it in the past.If the Leader of the Opposition is somehow tossing and turning in his bed at night concerned that $250,000 is about to be spent at the Evesham State School and then it is going to close, can I tell him he can go and have a good night's sleep - that is not what is happening. Can I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he wants to broaden his view then he may want to think to himself about how this program is supporting jobs right around the country during the worst global recession in 75 years. He might like to think to himself about how this is modernising our schools as needed for the future. If the Leader of the Opposition is going to lose sleep about anything, I think he should be losing sleep about his lack of support for those local jobs and his lack of support for schools around the country.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question and note the importance with which the government takes the issue of men's health and the actions we are taking. I note also, and it is particularly relevant today, that this evening the Treasurer will be launching awareness month for prostate cancer. It is that issue on which I want to address members of the parliament today. We take men's health very seriously. Prostate cancer is an important issue for every man in Australia. The Prostate Cancer Foundation at its website tells us - and it is very important for those of us in this place, most of us in middle age, some of us progressing through middle age -  -  - It is a question of definition of middle age. I can tell you that you all fit it. Some of you don't, young lady. What we need to know is that, for a man in his 40s, there is a one-in-a-thousand chance of a diagnosis of prostate cancer; for a man in his 50s - and there are plenty in this place - 12 in a thousand; for a man in his 60s, 45 in a thousand; for a man in his 70s, 80 in a thousand. Each year in Australia close to 3,000 men die of prostate cancer. That is equal to the number of women who die from breast cancer annually. Around 18,700 cases are diagnosed in Australia every year. Every day about 32 men receive the news that they have prostate cancer. Tragically, one man every three hours will lose his battle against this insidious disease. One in nine men in Australia will develop prostate cancer during their lifetime. Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men and is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men.The government takes this issue very seriously. We have provided $15 million over five years to establish two dedicated prostate cancer research centres, the first of their kind in Australia. One is located at Epworth Hospital in Richmond and the other at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane, hosted by the Queensland University of Technology. These centres will conduct research to develop improved diagnostic tests, screening tools and treatments. Research programs are already underway at these two sites: $10.8 million has been provided in 2009 for 45 grants dealing specifically with prostate cancer through the National Health and Medical Research Council and $2.5 million has also been provided to fund a range of organisations through the Building Cancer Support Network grants. A further $2.6 million will be provided until 2012. Andrology Australia will also receive $1.2 million to support its focus on the prevention of men's sexual and reproductive health issues, including prostate cancer.The important thing, though, is that all Australian men need to take responsibility for their own health. All Australian men, and particularly those of us in middle and later middle age, need to have a regular health check, which includes a check for prostate cancer. I confirmed with my good friend Dr Washer that this would mean a PSA test and a simple physical examination. It does not hurt, it is worth doing and it could save your life.</DOC>

 - I do welcome the question from the shadow Treasurer because it enables me to clear up a number of matters and distortions that the shadow Treasurer has been engaged in for some time. I am sure that whatever he quoted then certainly is not a reflection of my position. It is part of a determined campaign by those opposite to camouflage their vote against the stimulus by running a scare campaign, which claims there is some link between the government's stimulus and any particular rise in interest rates that may be decided by the Reserve Bank independently of the government.The first point is very clear. Interest rates are at record lows - 50-year lows. These settings have been described by the Governor of the Reserve Bank as emergency settings. There were cuts to the cash rate of 425 basis points late last year and through into this year. Of course, that has brought great benefit, particularly to those with a mortgage. Someone with a $300,000 mortgage would have had the benefit of something like $9,000 a year. It was part of a powerful monetary policy response put in place by the Reserve to complement and to work with a very powerful fiscal policy response put in place by the government. The result of that is that our economy grew by 0.6 in the year through to June and without that stimulus it would have contracted. That was just the fiscal stimulus. Of course, the monetary stimulus has been on top of that. It is viewed around the world as being one of the most effective stimulus packages put in place.The Governor of the Reserve Bank has also made the point that he is entirely comfortable with the fiscal stance of the government and its medium-term fiscal policy. He also made the point that, because rates are at emergency lows, at some stage into the future they will rise; they will be adjusted independently by the Reserve Bank. That brings me to the next point, and this is where those opposite are so desperate with their scare campaign. They come into this House and somehow pretend that global forces are not going to have any impact on interest rates in this country. Of course they will - they will have an impact in this country as they will have an impact around the world. The Prime Minister and I have made the point that rates internationally will rise over time as the global economy recovers, and we are not immune from that, and that will impact on the cost of credit in this country. The other factor that does impact on it is official decisions of the Reserve Bank which they take independently.I would make the point that the 0.6 per cent growth figure that we recorded in June is well below trend growth. Trend growth came in at 0.6 for the year; that is, there is a lot of spare capacity in the Australian economy. But, of course, just as we are unwinding our fiscal stimulus as we go through next year, monetary policy will be adjusted as well. That is what happens when an economy begins to grow.Those opposite are so desperate that they come into this House and somehow pretend that the fiscal stance of the government will have an immediate and direct effect on decisions of the Reserve Bank, when it is not the case. It is yet another scare campaign from those opposite to hide their embarrassment at the fact that they came into this House in February and voted against the package we put in place to support small business and to support employment in the Australian economy. Of course, now that they have been proved wrong by the data, by all international organisations and by the Australian business community, they seek to hide their embarrassment from that fact by constructing another fake and false scare campaign.The business community in particular understands the importance in this country of having customers come through the door. The construction industry understands the importance in this country of our stimulus measures and the business community also understands that they are wound down over time. They were put in place to have the maximum impact in the June quarter, and we can see the results of that. As we go through subsequent quarters they will be wound down. That is as it should be, because fiscal stimulus is temporary and targeted. They cannot hide -  - Sloppy Joe over there cannot hide his embarrassment that when the nation needed the Liberal Party to back the country they backed themselves. You can see the embarrassment on their faces here today. How do they go out and explain to the Australian community that when business needed the backing and when workers needed employing they were playing politics in the parliament. This distortion of what I have said in this House from the shadow Treasurer today is yet another example of another scare campaign to camouflage the fact that they have not got one positive idea for Australia's future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question, and particularly for his hard work on behalf of more than 23½ thousand pensioners in his electorate.I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that from 20 September we are going to deliver an increase to the pension payments of 3.3 million aged pensioners, disability support pensioners, those on carer payment, wife and widow pensioners and veterans on income support payments. These increases are fair, sustainable and long overdue. They certainly provide Australia's pensioners with much needed support but, of course, also strengthen the pension system to make sure that we are meeting the needs of an ageing population.The government's secure and sustainable pension reform was, of course, announced by the Treasurer in the May budget, and these are the most significant reforms to the pension since it was introduced 100 years ago. From today, and over the next two weeks, pensioners will receive letters from Centrelink setting out their payment rates. From 20 September, in just a few days time, a single pensioner on the maximum rate of the pension will receive an increase of $32.50 a week. That is as a result of the budget increases. This will be paid via an increase of $32.00 a week in the base pension and a $2.50 a week increase in the new pension supplement.The new pension supplement will include the full value of the utilities allowance; the telephone allowance, paid at the higher internet rate; the GST supplement; the pharmaceutical allowance plus the increase in the base rate; and, of course, the increase for the pension supplement. These increases are in addition to that which pensioners can expect to receive from regular indexation. Regular indexation will also occur on 20 September.Members might be aware that we have introduced a new pensioner living cost index as part of this major reform package. This will operate alongside the consumer price index and the male total average weekly earnings benchmark. Just for the information of pensioners who might be listening, and all members, this September the government's new pensioner living cost index has resulted in the higher pension rise, rather than either the CPI or the MTAWE benchmark.For the information of all members, total indexation for single pensioners will be $5.83 a fortnight and for couples combined will be $9.93. As a result of the budget increases and indexation single pensioners on the maximum rate will see an increase of $70.83 a fortnight from 20 September, bringing their total pension payments to $671.90 a fortnight. Pensioner couples on the maximum rate of the pension will receive a pension reform increase of $20.30 a fortnight, paid through the new pension supplement, and indexation increases of $9.63 a fortnight. This will bring the total increase for couple pensioners combined to $29.93 a fortnight for those on the maximum rate, bringing their total pension payments to $1,013 a fortnight.In these very difficult economic times we have succeeded in fundamentally reforming the pension system, making it adequate for the millions of aged pensioners, disability support pensioners, carers and those veterans who do depend on it. We have also made the very tough policy decisions to make sure that this pension rise is affordable so that Australians have got a fair and adequate pension system for those who need it when they need it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. He raised a number of very important points of policy, and I will attempt to address as many of them as I can. I start off by saying that I and the government recognise the enormous potential of Northern Australia. With dangerous climate change, this brings great opportunities to that region and also great dangers and great threats to a number of our traditional industries elsewhere in the country. Indeed, I think this is a view shared by the member for Solomon, the minister for regional development, the member for Kalgoorlie, the member for Leichhardt and the member for Dawson.There is a variety of issues here. I will start with one that is foremost in my mind. Can I say that I very much enjoyed my recent trip to Mount Isa - to the centre of what is called the 'northern economic triangle'. This was to evaluate, as the minister for resources knows, what can be done not just to enhance the supply of power to Mount Isa but, in solving this critical problem, to further enhance mining in the region and, most particularly, to liberate the potential of this area for renewable energy.If you look at a map of Australia in terms of potential for renewable energy, what you will find is that across Northern Australia - and particularly in the seat of Kennedy - there is enormous potential for renewable energy, for solar, for geothermal and for wind power. If we can overcome some of the issues to do with transmission - and a part of that is a study about power to Mount Isa - then that combined with the government's response to climate change through the CPRS, and most particularly through the renewable energy target, will have a dramatic impact and provide an enormous incentive for investment in these areas. That is just with renewable energy, and there are many other possibilities.The Prime Minister has been to the Ord, where something like $100 million is going in from the Commonwealth to stage 2 of the Ord. On top of all of that there is the potential for industry and the potential for trade. The Minister for Trade is spending enormous numbers of hours on planes, going around the world trying to do something about breaking through the gridlock in the Doha trade round. There was a very encouraging meeting in India just last week in which the Minister for Trade was very prominent in trying to ensure that we can make some progress. Why do I raise that issue? I raise that issue because one of the very big problems we have, being a country that produces an enormous amount of rural produce, is getting access to markets. Many other things need to be done in that sector but without getting access to markets we have a real problem, and the government is very much seized by that issue. That did happen over the last 12 years, as the member for Kennedy indicated. Come in, spinner, because the member for Kennedy was quite correct in his categorisation of the inertia of the previous government when it came to Northern Australia.I have always had a long interest - as the member for Kennedy knows - in what can be done to enhance food processing in this country. The nature of food processing has a lot to do with price at the farm gate, as the member for Kennedy has indicated. A review of the Horticulture Code of Conduct is currently in train and recommendations are coming from that. Even if those opposite do not understand this, I know that the member for Kennedy does understand the importance and how those couple of issues are linked. Then there is the wider issue of what happens to agriculture in this country. You are correct to point to the fact that there is so much water in the north and that, as climate change comes forward, we have some very big decisions as a country to take in this area. That is just covering a few of the issues raised by the member for Kennedy but, as always, I am happy to talk to him later on about the rest of them.</DOC>

 - The Harmer review and these pension reforms are good news for the veteran community in this country. We are talking about an additional $1.1 billion with respect to income support for those veterans and war widows who are in a situation where they rely on government income support. We are talking about some 320,000 Veterans' Affairs pensioners in this situation, some 190,000 service pensioners and over 105,000 war widows. This comes on top of the 325,000 or thereabouts who benefited from the bonus payments in the first stimulus package and the nearly 130,000 who received support under the second stimulus package.The Harmer focus was very much on the issue of income support for those who really needed it. As was outlined by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs earlier, it was also about simplification of payments and also improved indexation methods. It is complex, and the circumstances around individual veterans are something which they will need to understand. They will be written to accordingly to ensure that they have the information that they need to understand the nature of what they are receiving. -  - Again, the point was targeting where it was really needed for those who definitely required it - those who were on the lowest levels of income support from government. I note from some of the interjections that there have been issues raised around the question of disability pensioners under Veterans' Affairs, the circumstances they face and the position around the question of why they did not receive this increase with respect to their disability pension payments. Let us make it clear, though: overwhelmingly they do receive support through these changes. Of TPIs - those most severely disabled veterans who have suffered in the cause of their country - some 80 per cent-plus will receive benefits as they receive income support payments from government because they are in a situation where they are reliant on income support payments from government. Some 60 per cent of TPIs will in fact receive a net benefit into the future regardless of the impact of the taper rate and the transition situation, because nearly 50 per cent of TPIs are in receipt of the maximum level of income support they can receive from government according to their circumstances, whether they be single or in a couple. In fact, overall almost two-thirds of DVA disability pensioners, including those on general rates, will receive benefits through this system.I want to make it very clear: the indexation method that was fought for over a 10-year period of neglect under the Howard government has been maintained and enhanced through the introduction of PBLCI as outlined earlier during question time. There is absolutely no doubt that this is a positive move forward for the veterans community in terms of those relying on income support. - I note also from some of the comments made across the table that there are issues around the question: what does the opposition really stand for on this issue? Maybe it is time we heard what their actual position is, because there has been a bit of smoking going on around the edges - smoky positions with respect to this. There were a few people on email suggesting certain things about what they stand for and a few people around the edges intimating that they might support the shadow minister over there. The shadow minister, the member for Paterson, has alluded to the fact that there might be some support there. Let us get clear what the opposition's position has been with respect to these issues over the term of this parliament. - That is an interesting point, but you see, Member for Kalgoorlie, there actually was an opposition position on this issue. It is one of the few issues where you actually had a position. - You might recall that when the member for Bradfield was the Leader of the Opposition you had a position. You believed targeted income support was an urgent need. So what did you have? You had 30 bucks a week for single age pensioners, but that is all you had. - In fact, when asked the member for Bradfield specifically excluded service pensioners - I might add, to the shock of the RSL and others in the ex-service community. But then you had another policy. The member for Wentworth became Leader of the Opposition and you expanded that to cover -  - Sorry. The opposition, Mr Speaker, expanded it to cover service pensioners, but they still left out couples and war widows. So even when they have had a policy - and it is one of the few areas they have had a policy in since they have been in opposition - the circumstances were that they excluded massive elements of the veteran community. So where is your policy now? Are you supporting an income support targeted approach as implemented by this government? You are, because you have passed the legislation, but are you going further than that? Are you prepared to go further? I do not think you are.</DOC>

 - That is not bad coming from someone who was a member of a government that was the highest taxing government in Australian history, spent like a drunken sailor at the height of a boom and presided over 10 interest rate rises in a row when it had promised to keep interest rates at record lows. That is the record of the Howard government, and we will not do what it did, which was to mislead the Australian people when it claimed it would keep interest rates at record lows. That is what it did. It told a lie to the Australian people and it was sprung at the last election. That is exactly what happened. So let us have no more humbug from those opposite when it comes to interest rates. - Yes, more sloppy work from the shadow Treasurer. He is famous for it, because he has no attention to detail and he gets it wrong most of the time. He was in here twittering yesterday in question time. That gives you some idea of the attention to detail and their focus on alternative policy. What lies at the core of the argument that is being put forward by those frauds opposite is simply this: somehow they are claiming that the responsible borrowing that we had to do -  - Yes, responsible borrowing - responsible borrowing to save the Australian economy, responsible borrowing to support business, responsible borrowing to support workers - something which never has a priority with those on that side of the House. - As a consequence of the global recession, the government had to borrow to cover the revenue collapse - and there was a revenue collapse of $210 billion. Those opposite do not want to acknowledge that fact because, presumably, if they will not acknowledge that fact, they can come into this House and tell us how they were going to make up the difference. Were they going to cut government services by $210 billion or were they going to put up taxes by $210 billion? If they had done either of those, they would have crashed the economy. - We did have to borrow responsibly to support the economy. Those opposite will not acknowledge that and what they have to nominate is the increased taxes or the services cuts they would have put in place to replace the loss of $210 billion. This goes to the very core of their economic credibility. It is the case that we have borrowed responsibly for economic stimulus, and they will never understand that our stimulus has been carefully designed to withdraw from the economy as the private sector recovers. That is how it is designed; that is how it is constructed. It means doing all the heavy lifting that those opposite have opposed every inch of the way when private demand was at its lowest. Withdrawing it is just common sense as private demand returns. So they have it so wrong on stimulus. All of this hysteria and all of their scare campaigns are about camouflaging the fact that they have not got a clue what is going on - absolutely clueless.They said the stimulus would not work; now they are saying it has worked too well. They said it would not create a single job; now they are saying it is creating too many. The Leader of the Opposition said that the stimulus was not going to create a single job. Has there ever been a bigger own goal in public policy in the last 50 years than what the Leader of the Opposition said at the Press Club when he said stimulus would not create a single job? If anything demonstrates how clueless they are, if anything demonstrates the lack of judgment of the modern Liberal Party, it was that statement at the Press Club just prior to the budget this year. All the way through this term they have shirked the hard work. We know the job is not finished and, in the face of this dirty scare campaign which has no basis in fact, we are going to defend the national interest and support Australian jobs.</DOC>

 - Today the member for Werriwa assisted in the launch of the Good Gear Guide, a practical initiative developed by industry and the Motorcycle Safety Consultative Committee in conjunction with my department. It was a very big event at the front of Parliament House. We had the member for Werriwa and the member for Bradfield both in their leathers out there with their bikes supporting motorcycling safety. They were joined by the press gallery's own two-wheeler Malcolm Farr as part of the launch. - He was wearing leather as well, I can inform the Deputy Prime Minister. The member for Bradfield summed it up best when he said, 'Motorcycling's a bit like politics: you need a back protector.' Who better than the member for Bradfield to know that? It is an activity that we all love. It is not quite as dangerous as politics, but is getting there. I thank the member for Bradfield, the member for Werriwa, Malcolm Farr and the Motorcycle Safety Consultative Committee, including Shaun Lennard from the Australian Motorcycle Council, for their promotion of this important safety initiative.The number of registered motorcycles has grown by 50 per cent over the last five years and we are seeing great growth, particularly in recreational riding. It is important that the message get out there that people need to be safe every time they get on a motorcycle, be it a scooter or right up to a superbike. Those figures come through in that motorcycles make up five per cent of registered passenger vehicles on the road but motorcyclists make up 17 per cent of fatalities. We know that 12,000 motorcycle riders are hospitalised every year as a result of either on-road or off-road crashes.What the Good Gear Guide does is promote a valuable resource in that it helps riders to protect themselves in the best possible way - and that is through what they are wearing. There is no doubt that many injuries can be avoided or their severity reduced if riders are wearing the right gear: appropriate protective clothing including jackets, boots, gloves and, of course, helmets. This is very much a practical guide that will help riders when they are shopping to get the right gear. It can also be downloaded from my department's website www.infrastructure.gov.au. It is a great safety resource and I encourage local members to promote the Good Gear Guide in their electorates - even with their reduced newsletters, they can certainly do that. This is a very practical initiative and I very much thank Malcolm Farr, the member for Bradfield and the member for Werriwa for their assistance with today's launch.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and, of course, to the member for Lowe, who I know works with his local schools and, apart from working with his local schools -  - He is so busy working with his local schools he has obviously been detained from question time! The important thing, of course, is noting that the member for Lowe works with his local schools and he also comes into this parliament and votes for his local schools to benefit from programs like Building the Education Revolution.I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his concern about this school, the Abbotsford school, in the member for Lowe's electorate, but I presume that his concern does not extend to all schools. If it extended to all schools then of course he would have voted for the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history and he would have voted to support jobs today during the global recession. But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition not only voted against the Abbotsford school getting any funding but voted against 9,500 schools around this country getting any. He voted against more than 24,000 projects. He did not want to support one building, one refurbishment or one job around the country.What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that, as he is aware from parliament yesterday and from waking up and reading his newspapers - because that is the way that the opposition gets all of its information; it reads the newspapers - the issue of the Abbotsford school was raised in parliament yesterday. What I said yesterday is what I am saying today, which is that we are very happy to work with the school community to resolve this problem. What the Leader of the Opposition may not know is that there is already a process in train involving the New South Wales Building the Education Revolution coordinator to work on the issue raised by the local school.As I said to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, this is a program involving 9,500 schools and more than 24,000 projects. We have a mechanism for people to raise concerns and when I talked to the parliament yesterday I advised the parliament that through that mechanism 49 complaints had been raised in total. We are willing to work with local schools. We are willing to work with the Abbotsford school, and a process is in train doing that today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question. I inform the House today of the labour force data which has just been released for the month of August, which shows that the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.8 per cent. This was better than market expectations, where the range was between 5.9 and 6.2. However, if we look further at the data, we also see that there remain real causes for concern for the future.Employment itself fell by some 27,100, and this was because we saw a fall in full-time employment of 30,800, while part-time employment rose by 3,800. This reflects a theme over recent months. Furthermore, the participation rate decreased by 0.3 per cent to 65.1 per cent. The participation rate has now begun to fall from the peak of 65.5 that we had in March of this year. A further cause for concern is that the proportion of employed persons who want or are available to work more hours is now 7.8 per cent. This is the highest on record, the records going back some 31 years. What those three elements from the labour force data indicate is that Australia is not out of the woods yet when it comes to unemployment. If you visited various regions of Australia as I have done recently - and I see the member for Leichhardt there, from Far North Queensland - many regions in Australia are doing it particularly tough when it comes to the impact of the global economic recession on those regional economies.When you look at Australia's unemployment data, we are doing better than most of the rest of the world, and I draw the House's attention to the fact that most recently we have had unemployment rates in the United States of 9.7 per cent, in the United Kingdom of 7.8 per cent, in Japan of 5.7 per cent, in Canada of 8.7 per cent, in France of 9.5 per cent, in Germany of 8.3 per cent and in Italy of 7.3 per cent - the G7 average being some 8.2 per cent, the OECD average being some 8.3 per cent and Australia remaining at 5.8 per cent. This means that our unemployment rate, when compared with the major advanced economies, is currently the second lowest after Japan at 5.7 per cent.But these are no grounds for complacency whatsoever. The fact, however, that Australia is doing better than most of the other economies is not a product of accident. It is the product of two factors: early, strong and decisive action on the part of the Australian government through our national stimulus strategy through the nation building for recovery plan and the magnificent performance of Australian business, small business and workers across the Australian economy up against the most difficult global economic circumstances they have faced in three-quarters of a century.The nation building for recovery plan is about two things: supporting jobs, small business and apprenticeships today, while investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That is why we are currently investing in libraries, science centres, language centres, universities, TAFES and university and other research institutions. That is why we are investing in the National Broadband Network. That is why we are investing in rail, road and ports right across the country. In fact, I am advised by the Coordinator-General that currently we have 36,544 projects approved across Australia under the nation building for recovery plan; 16,897 of these projects have commenced and 670 have already been completed. This has been a massive effort in partnership with the private sector to support the economy.If the government had instead adopted the policy of the Liberal and National parties which is not to have engaged in economic stimulus in the Australian economy, Treasury have advised us that right now Australia would be in the depths of recession. Furthermore, they have advised us that our unemployment rate would have reached 10 per cent. That is the bottom line here. I say to those opposite that the nation building for recovery plan, again based on Treasury's advice, is that it is supporting employment of some 210,000 extra positions in the Australian economy than would otherwise be the case.Where does all this come together? It comes together in the fact that Australia is now the fastest growing of the major advanced economies. Secondly, we have the second lowest unemployment; thirdly, the lowest debt; and, fourthly, the lowest deficit. Fifthly, we are the only country so far not to have gone into recession. That is the government's strategy. It is worth reflecting, however, on what the opposition strategy is particularly when it comes to national and global responses.We know what their record is on the economy. We know that this is a party that when in government was the highest taxing government in Australia's history. We know that when they were in government they failed to produce any savings whatsoever in their last budget in contrast to the $54 billion worth of savings which have been registered in this government's first two budgets. We also know they were government of waste and extravagance as we have seen through the regional rorts program, and they are led by a Leader of the Opposition who is rainmaker himself - that $10 million allocation that has yet to be fully explained to the Australian people. We also know that they were a government which gave us 10 interest rate rises in a row despite having promised the Australian people they would keep interest rates at record lows. But most spectacularly, they were a government which squandered the opportunities delivered to them by the global resources boom and failed to invest in skills and infrastructure to set Australia up for the future despite receiving 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank to lift their game.When we go to the future, what is their plan to deal with this global economic recession now? It seems to be in about three points: the first is sit on your hands and do nothing; the second is to hope the economy will tank so they can take political advantage out of unemployment going up; and the third is to run a fear campaign on debt and deficit despite the fact that we are running the lowest debt and deficit of the major advanced economies and despite the fact that, based on whatever their last statement was, they seem to support 90 to 95 per cent of the borrowings which this government has already indicated.It is all a political strategy. It is not an economic strategy, which is why they stand alone without any support across the rest of the world or across Australia from any credible institution about their script for the economy now. But there is more. Yesterday we heard from the brains trust of the Liberal Party backbench - the member for Fadden. Yesterday afternoon we heard from the brains trust of the Liberal Party frontbench - the member for North Sydney - who has divined the real cause of the global economic malaise. During question time yesterday when various members were engaged in the debate, the member for North Sydney was twittering. He said on his twitter:listening to swan on the G20 and i am wondering how many finance ministers he met are left wingThen he went on to say in response to a question from Sky News:I think there is a centre-left movement across the world that is trying to run the line that government should be the centre of everything in our lives,He is talking about the G20 here, so move over the fake moon landing, move over the grassy knoll and move over the UFO sightings at Area 51 because we have a new global conspiracy: it is called the G20.The member for North Sydney forgets the fact that the G20 was established a decade ago by that other leading leftist in this place - partly, at least - the member for Higgins, at a finance ministers' meeting, and I have referred to that fact here. This G20 meeting of finance ministers was elevated to summit level by that other leading global leftist George W Bush and now the G20 is populated by those other major global leftists, Sarkozy the Socialist, Berlusconi the Bolshevik, obviously, and Merkel - she must be a Menshevik, I suppose. What planet are you on, Joe? He then went one further though, and in answer to the question from David Speers, 'So Barack Obama, Gordon Brown should not be following the strategies they are following?' the member for North Sydney said:I think Americans are changing their opinion at a rapid rate of Barack Obama.Then he went on -  - I note the invitation from the member for North Sydney to keep going. In the G20 list I read before, of all those global leftists, I forgot to mention that leading global leftist, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. But I am sure he is part of Joe's new conspiracy theory.Then David Speers asked the member for North Sydney: 'So you think he' - President Obama - 'went too far?' 'Well, maybe I can't claim to be an expert on the US economy, but what I do know is that the American people are starting to question Barack Obama's management of the US economy.' What is it about the Liberals and President Obama? There they were, under John Howard, saying that his election would be a victory for al-Qaeda. Now we see, on the economy, that they are saying it is a victory for global socialism. What is it about the obsession on the part of the Liberal Party when it comes to US President Obama and the Democrats? What we have with the Liberal Party today is a party which is out of touch, out of control and, can I say, out on their own.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wide Bay for his question. I note his interest in the Evesham State School, but I also presume he has got an interest in the 72 schools in his electorate that are having 263 projects supported through Building the Education Revolution, at a total investment of $119 million. I also think he might be interested in the fact that, in his electorate, the Noosa Christian College Principal, Ross Reid, said the following on 27 May 2009, about Building the Education Revolution - To the member for North Sydney, who thinks that he can interject upon me: I think that the person from whom I learned the most about this matter was in fact the former Prime Minister, who reminded us, each time, when a question was worded in a way that allowed it to be opened up, that, if a program was mentioned, that was sufficient. Whether the House as a whole is satisfied by that is a different matter. But - and I go back many, many parliaments - a number of governments have not taken the opportunity that was given to them by Procedure Committee reports to change this. So, consistent with past rulings, no matter how much criticism it brings to me, the mention of other matters under the program suffices the terms of relevance as they have been known in this chamber. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and can I say that I think the sensitivity displayed just then by the opposition shows an important point to the parliament, which is: the member has approached the dispatch box to ask about one school. But of course what he does not want to be reminded of is that he voted against resources going to every school in this country: he voted against resources going to the 72 schools in his electorate, he voted against resources going to schools in my electorate, he voted against resources going to schools in National Party electorates, he voted against resources going to schools in the electorates of independents - every school in this country. He came into this parliament and he put up his hand and he said, 'When it comes to spending money on schools, I say no.' And, in line with that kind of philosophy, apparently the member for Wide Bay is now saying the summit of his political career will be to come into this place and to say, '$250,000 that could be spent on a school should not be spent on a school.' That is the summit of his political career, apparently.The government will work with the Queensland education authorities as this consultation process goes through. We will work with any suggestions about alternative uses of that money. If an alternative use is identified, I will then come into the parliament and I will ask the member for Wide Bay - if we have identified a school that needs that money - to walk up to the dispatch box and say, 'I do not support that school getting that money.'Of course, this shows the sleight of hand across the board by the opposition about Building the Education Revolution. We have the shadow Treasurer, known for his sloppiness and his inability to think logically, out there saying, 'Cut the program; take money out of schools.' The member for Sturt, who is only known for part-time work, at least had the wit -  - I am just about to compliment you, actually. - Can I say to the shadow minister: I was just about compliment him, so I did not want to be interrupted, because it is a rare day. The shadow Treasurer is out there saying, 'Let's cut funding to schools, to Building the Education Revolution.' The shadow minister, the member for Sturt, at least has the wit to guard his language and not use that terminology. When he has been asked, he has said that funding should be maintained to schools. The opposition had better sort out their position on this - two different forms of words, and they voted against it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Last week I had the opportunity to visit Barrow Island in WA to receive a briefing on the proposed Gorgon LNG plant for the joint-venture partners.I see the WA members may be gearing themselves up for another walkout. Is that right? I would have thought all members of this House would appreciate news on a positive economic development for the country - perhaps not the WA members from the Liberal Party.Gorgon is one of around 80 resource projects which have been committed or proposed around the country. These projects, if they come to pass, will create demand for up to 70,000 construction jobs. Gorgon alone would require some 6,000 people at the peak of the construction. This presents, of course, a major challenge for government and industry to ensure that projects have the skilled workers they need. For this reason, the government has established a National Resource Sector Employment Taskforce. I am pleased to advise that the establishment of this task force has received a very positive response from both industry and the Western Australian government.Furthermore, what we must do is avoid the simple repeat of the mistakes of the previous decade, which saw the emergence of not just a whole range of infrastructure bottlenecks but skills bottlenecks as well. Therefore we need a better effort at coordinating what can be done to provide the skilled labour as well as the infrastructure necessary to support this great expansion of our national economy. Therefore what we intend to do is to work closely with industry and with state and territory governments to help increase the supply of skilled labour - boilermakers, construction workers, riggers, logistics, transport, hospitality staff, the whole box and dice - who actually make these huge projects work on the ground. Furthermore, in the case of the Gorgon project we will also employ a major project employment coordinator, simply because of the intensity of the skills ask out of that single project, which is massive.For the benefit of the House, I have further positive news about the Gorgon project which I draw to the attention of honourable members. Chevron Australia has, a few minutes ago, announced in Perth that it has signed three binding LNG sales purchase agreements, for nearly three million tonnes per annum of LNG into Japan and South Korea. The first of these agreements is with Osaka Gas, for the supply of 1.375 million tonnes per annum. The second is with Tokyo Gas, for the supply of 1.1 million tonnes. The third is with GS Caltex in South Korea, for the supply of 0.5 million tonnes per annum for a period of up to 20 years. I am advised that these contracts could deliver in the order of $70 billion worth of exports for Australia over the next 25 years.It has been a great month for the Australian LNG export industry, with our first long-term contract to supply India, worth $25 billion; our biggest ever single trade deal, a $50 billion contract with PetroChina; and, today, further details of deals of the same magnitude - in fact greater magnitude when combined - with Japan and Korea. These are massive projects that will generate economic growth, income, jobs and prosperity for the nation for decades to come. In light of this announcement, I congratulate Chevron Australia. These sales do not come to pass easily. I also congratulate our counterparts in the WA government for the work that they have done. I also place on record my appreciation for the efforts which have been made by the federal Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, and the federal Minister for Trade, Simon Crean.The key thing from this project, though, apart from it being a real shot in the arm for the national economy, is for us again to learn the lessons of the past, to do better when it comes to the proper planning and provision of infrastructure and skills to deal with this potentially huge expansion in Australia's resource industry. I have made two specific announcements in this respect today. There is more to be done, but the government is up for the task of working with industry, the WA state government and other state governments to make sure that we properly support these projects into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. -  - And I thank those opposite for their chorus of abuse about supporting Australian education. Can I say to the shadow minister opposite: of course, he voted against the Building the Education Revolution program, but he might like to recall that it is supporting jobs today during a global recession, the biggest economic downturn in 75 years, whilst supporting over 24,000 projects in 9,500 schools around the country. Of course, we expect the Liberal Party, who voted against this here and then run around electorates, desperate to associate themselves with the individual projects -  - Of course we expect the Liberal Party to come in here and nitpick about this problem and to deny what other Australians know, which is that this program is supporting jobs. It is supporting the jobs of tradies. It is supporting the jobs of carpenters, plumbers and electricians around the nation during a global recession, whilst building the school infrastructure we need for tomorrow. Overwhelmingly, this program is delivering results that school communities want. - As this program supports local jobs, it is supporting modernisation of school facilities that schools want. We have always said that with a program of this size and scale we expect there to be individual problems, complaints and concerns. I have consistently said that if members have individual problems or complaints or concerns they would like addressed then, obviously, they can come and talk to me and they can go through the departmental promise processes.What is interesting to me and I think may be of interest to other members of the House is that I have had members of the opposition come to me to get problems resolved, and we have resolved them. But what happens in question time, obviously - it happened yesterday and it is happening today - is that members of the opposition raise individual examples like this one and supply no follow-up or comprehensive information to us to enable us to resolve the problem. So I will say this to the member for Sturt, very directly, on the question that he has asked me -  - I will finish the sentence that I started before being interrupted by the member for Sturt. I say to the member for Sturt, very directly: if he has a genuine concern about costs applied to this local school, if he will supply me with the information he is referring to, I will follow the matter up, I will report back to him and I will report back to the parliament. If the member for Sturt has no genuine concern and simply wants to make cheap political points about education in circumstances where as a shadow minister he has no policies or plans for education in the nation's future then people will judge him on it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question because, for those of us on this side of the House, support for employment goes to the very core of our belief system and it goes to the very core of the government's economic stimulus, which is supporting jobs and which is supporting small business. It keeps customers going through the door, and it is supporting employment through this global recession.That is why it was so stunning, just before question time, to watch the shadow Treasurer in his press conference, because the shadow Treasurer indicated that the principal aim of the opposition's economic policy was not to support employment in the middle of a global recession. Of course, you can see it through all the questions asked in the House here today, nitpicking away at the edges of a program that goes to the core of supporting employment in Australia and supporting small business. The employment and unemployment figures today are quite important but obviously irrelevant to those on that side of the House. The shadow Treasurer does not think it is the principal aim of economic policy to stop the destruction that occurs in families when people lose their jobs - and the demand that is reduced, which destroys small business. That is no longer an objective of those who sit opposite. It goes into a long line of clangers dropped by the shadow Treasurer in and out of the House in recent days.In terms of the figures today, there is an unemployment rate of 5.8 per cent where employment fell by 27,000 people. But the fact is there are still 663,000 unemployed Australians. This government will move heaven and earth in a responsible way to support employment. For those on the other side of the House, this is just about playing politics. We have seen a rolled gold example of that today where, because the unemployment rate did not go up, the Leader of the Opposition did not go out. He did not go out to do the press conference. He only ever goes out when the unemployment figure goes up, because the only job he is concerned about is his. He is not concerned about the employment of the Australian people. Had he been concerned about the employment of the Australian people he would have voted for the economic stimulus measures in this House.It pays to go through the list. In February unemployment went up 0.4 per cent and there was a Turnbull doorstop. In March, unemployment went up by 0.4 per cent and there was a Turnbull doorstop. In April unemployment went down and there was no Turnbull doorstop. In May unemployment went up and there was a Turnbull doorstop. In June unemployment went up and there was a Turnbull doorstop. - July: there was no change in unemployment and no Leader of the Opposition doorstop. -  - That is right - no leadership. There was no leadership today because the shadow Treasurer was again sent out. But what did he do? He went out and gave a press conference saying that employment was not the principal objective of the opposition's economic policy. That is all very clear. It is very clear that the only jobs they care about are theirs. They do not care about the jobs of the Australian people and they do not care about the businesses in Australia that depend upon having employed workers walking through the door.We did see the other clanger, which the Prime Minister referred to before. It was a classic. On Sky, yesterday afternoon with David Speers he advanced his left-wing conspiracy theory about the behaviour of the G20. The reason the G20 is supporting coordinated global action is that they are all dominated by the centre-left. All of these countries sitting around the table are dominated by the centre-left. When the Prime Minister and I go to the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh in a couple of weeks time, we will look forward to the European caucus at the G20 with Merkel, Sarkozy and Berlusconi all sitting around singing the Internationale and all getting carried away with the occasion. This shadow Treasurer will go to any lengths to distort any fact to misrepresent anything in the economy because the only job he cares about is his.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. Can I say to the member for Boothby: whilst I grew up in the Unley council area, I was actually never elected as a local councillor in Unley. On matters associated with the Unley planning scheme and local government acts in South Australia, he may want to make the change to the South Australian state parliament. I believe they will probably be looking for another opposition leader quite soon, so it could be a very good opportunity for him for his future working life.In response to the member's question, what is being done through the Building the Education Revolution is the delivery of economic stimulus urgently to support jobs today during a global recession whilst engaging in the biggest school modernisation -  - Economic stimulus is being delivered urgently to support jobs now - something, of course, which is not an economic goal of the Liberal Party as stated by the shadow Treasurer - and also to provide the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. It is true that, in order to deliver urgent economic stimulus to support tradespeople and their jobs today, we did ask state governments and local and Catholic education authorities to expedite the delivery of this program. I say to the shadow minister opposite: I really think we are getting to a fairly interesting stage in this debate if it is being suggested that it is a federal government responsibility to deal with a planning dispute about the removal of trees. I think the fact that the Liberal Party has come into this parliament to raise that point says everything about the absolute absurdity of its attitude to a global recession. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The point of order - or the interjection disguised as a point of order - makes the very point that it is not federal development rules that have been suspended, and planning matters are matters for state governments. But I make this point: it amazes and concerns me that in the middle of a global recession, the biggest economic downturn in 75 years, when a global economic storm is hitting this country and costing Australia jobs, the biggest thing on the mind of the federal opposition in question time in the national parliament is a matter involving a planning dispute about a number of trees in a suburb in Unley. It says everything about being out of touch, out of ideas and out of any contact with reality. If they try focusing on the big picture - jobs today - and try actually developing some education policies, the Liberal Party might find that someone, sometime, somewhere takes them seriously.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and for raising the important national issue of unemployment, of jobs and of Australians who have families to support having jobs. It is something, of course, that the Liberal Party clearly cares nothing about, given the question that we have just seen raised in question time today and given the statements of the shadow Treasurer that keeping people in work is not an economic objective as far as the Liberal Party is concerned. Today we received the ABS data for last month and a record of the unemployment rate, and unemployment held steady at 5.8 per cent.The member for Corangamite would have ascertained that unemployment remained steady at 5.8 per cent. He may have ascertained that by going to the ABS website to have a look at the data, or he may have ascertained that unemployment must have held steady because he did not see the Leader of the Opposition appear at a press conference. When it comes to the ABS unemployment series, on the Thursdays on which we deal with that, the Leader of the Opposition is like a political undertaker: you only ever see him if there is bad news. The political undertaker turned up in February, because unemployment went up. He turned up in March, because unemployment went up. He did not turn up in April, when unemployment went down. He turned up in May, when unemployment went up. He turned up in June, when unemployment went up. But, of course, in July and August, when the unemployment rate was steady, the political undertaker was nowhere to be seen. It just goes to show that nothing excites the Liberal Party more than bad news. The only thing they are ever interested in is bad news. That attitude about bad news - waiting for an unemployment number that goes up, seeking to celebrate when they see a bit of bad economic news - transfers into their attitude to education policy, economic stimulus and programs to support Australian jobs.The member for Corangamite has asked me about programs to support Australian jobs. Of course, he is familiar with the operation of the Building the Education Revolution program in his electorate and the support it is providing for jobs for local tradespeople. In his electorate, work is being done at an indoor stadium at the Torquay school and work is being done at the St Therese Catholic Primary School. That work is employing people from the following contractors: Wes Marshall, plumbing - jobs; Aaron Mitchell, painting - jobs; Easy Shades - jobs; GJ Handyman Services - jobs; Geelong Concrete Grinding - jobs; and New Wave Electrics - jobs. Members opposite are interested in what building looks like. Well, here is a picture of people working on this job in the electorate of Corangamite - real people, real work, people working, people employed and people taking money home to their families.That is what Building the Education Revolution is about - while engaging in the biggest school modernisation program in Australia's history. This is a government that is focused on doing what we can to cushion Australians from the effects of a global recession whilst delivering the education system that we need for the future. This is an opposition that is focused on bad news - and the height of their policy development after almost two years in opposition is to be concerned about a local planning dispute and trees in Unley!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. The member for Indi I take it is referring to a media report today about some concern that some out of school hours care may be disrupted during the construction phase of Building the Education Revolution. Can I say to the member for Indi that I travel to a lot of schools and I anticipate she probably travels to a number of childcare centres and early learning facilities and out of school hours care facilities, and what I think she would find when she does that is a lot of hard-working people. I certainly do that when I go to schools. When I talk to them about how they are going to manage construction at their school to support jobs today and to modernise their school facilities, something that they are enthusiastic about, they normally work very carefully through plans to keep activity going and to move children and teaching through facilities so that they can keep activity going whilst they do new construction. Of course, everybody would know who has ever been to a school that is building a new facility, or a hospital that is building a new facility or a university that is building a new facility, that this does require -  - As facilities are constructed, obviously plans are made to do everything that can be done to keep teaching going, after hours school care going and the like. It is inevitable when new facilities are being constructed that there will be some disruption and dust and inconvenience while the construction is in place. It has ever been so, it will ever be so. It has been so from the dawn of time and it will be so till the end of time. But responsible agencies, schools and schools authorities, are working through contingency arrangements. If the shadow minister has more information than simply revealed by today's press report and if she can identify to me an individual out of hours school care service where she thinks inappropriate arrangements have been made during the building, then please bring those very specific details to me and I will be happy to work with her and anybody else interested in doing what we can to assist. This is normal, standard practice.On the question of normal, standard practice, as recently as yesterday my office assisted two members of the opposition who came -  - I conclude by saying to the shadow minister and member for Indi that if she has specific information she wants to raise either in question time or with me, publicly or privately, I am obviously happy to work with her on individual concerns. But of course school authorities and individual school principals and teachers are people of goodwill and are making the best possible arrangements they can while these facilities are constructed.On the question of costs for working families, I await the day when we see fulsome congratulations from the shadow minister for the profound steps we took to better support working families with the costs of child care. I await that day.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. The government does have a comprehensive fiscal strategy which provides fiscal stimulus in the short term, as I was saying before, to provide absolutely essential support to the economy during the global recession. There is also a plan to bring the budget back into surplus as the economy recovers. This plan has been endorsed by the International Monetary Fund. It says few other advanced economies have adopted such a clear commitment.The question in this House is what the fiscal plan of those opposite is compared to that of the government. The member for North Sydney is this morning reported to have claimed that a reasonable emergency or maximum level of spending is 24 per cent of GDP. This would come as a shock to many in the House, not least of them the member for Higgins, because 10 of his 12 budgets exceeded that amount. Ten of his 12 budgets exceeded the target put by Sloppy Joe over there in the newspaper this morning. - I certainly will, Mr Speaker. 
Opposition members - Withdraw! - I do withdraw. The shadow Treasurer was very sloppy when he nominated expenditure as a percentage of GDP at 24 per cent. It was exceeded by the last Treasurer on 10 of 12 occasions. What would it mean? It would be the equivalent of ripping $50 billion, or four per cent of GDP, out of the economy. Is it any wonder they do not care about employment. If that were to be put in place in these circumstances, ripping four per cent of GDP out of the economy, it would drive growth down. It would send the economy back to recession if that foolish proposal was ever put into practice. They go on about budgets and they go on about spending, but the member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition have not put forward one concrete savings measure. They -  - Name one. - Name the savings measures that have been put forward - put them on the table. This strategy was announced on the very day that they knocked over a savings measure in the Senate worth $9.5 billion over 10 years. They have the hide to come into this House and lecture us about fiscal policy and knock over essential savings as part of a medium-term fiscal strategy in the Senate. I think the member for North Sydney must have had a terrible morning this morning. He would have got up, he would have opened his paper and the first headline he would have seen is 'Hockey vows to slash $14 billion'. Of course, we now know it was $50 billion, not $14 billion. A big headline this morning was 'Hockey vows to slash $14 billion'. - He goes, 'Oh, terrific.' The headline on page 4 is 'Liberals vow to slash public spending', until he nearly choked on his breakfast doughnut because there beside it on page 5, is 'Senate votes down $1.9bn health cuts'. That is the rabble that those opposite have become. They announce a steely determination to put forward fiscal restraint and then knock off a saving in the Senate. They simply cannot be taken seriously.Let us look at the saving they knocked off in the Senate. They say they have got priorities. If they have got priorities we know where they lie because they knocked off the saving whereby low-income workers and middle-income workers subsidise the health insurance of very high income earners. We certainly know what their priorities are: to crash the economy and to tilt the playing field against people on modest incomes. That is very clear. They do not have a policy; they just have an interview in the Australian newspaper. They want to whinge about debt and then vote against savings, because they do not have an alternative policy. They have got an interview posing as a policy and that is simply it. That is how bankrupt they have become. In contrast, we on this side of the House do have a medium-term fiscal strategy. We are determined to support the Australian economy when it needs it, to withdraw stimulus in a timely way when private demand returns and to put in place our medium-term fiscal strategy. Those on the other side of the House are simply a rabble.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister and member for Dunkley for his question. We have had the issue of Langwarrin Primary School raised in this House before - that is correct. My advice on Langwarrin Primary School is that the school agreed to apply for $3 million under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program and that that was for a library and a learning neighbourhood centre that the school wanted, that my department has been provided with documentation which shows that the school agreed to this proposal and that the documentation was signed on or around 9 June 2009 by the Langwarrin Primary School principal and the Langwarrin Primary School council president. The proposal that was put with the documentation, as I am advised, has been supplied to my department, indicating that both the principal and the school council president agreed to the delivery of the project that is being delivered. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. That is the advice I have. I say to the member for Dunkley - as he may well know, being a Victorian - and shadow minister: I have conducted a number of principals forums in Victoria. I have met with literally dozens and dozens of principals there to talk about Building the Education Revolution. I have engaged in comparable processes around the country where principals are always welcome to raise individual concerns with me. If it would assist the member I am more than happy to meet with any representative from the school he would like me to meet with. I am happy to travel to the school to discuss the issue with him if he would prefer that.I say to the member and to members of parliament generally: we are talking about a program, first and foremost, that is delivering more than 24,000 projects in 9,500 schools around the country. We have always said in the delivery of a program of that size and scale - delivered quickly for the very good purpose of supporting jobs today during the global recession and keeping tradespeople, architects and others employed who would not be employed during this global economic downturn but for this expenditure - like any human activity, there will be problems and complaints along the way. I know that the member has worked with this local school. We are obviously happy to work with this local school to address any complaints.I also say to the member: when I meet with the local school, if that is what he wants me to do, or go to the local school with him, if that is what he wants me to do, it will be incumbent upon him at the same time to say to the local school that when he was asked in this parliament whether he supported them getting one dollar of this resource he voted no.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for the question and for his ongoing interest in aviation issues. Today in the Senate the opposition supported the disallowance of important aviation security regulations which restrict who can enter the cockpit of an aircraft. The Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2009 were brought in to close a dangerous loophole in our aviation security laws on the advice of the appropriate aviation security authorities. The regulations made it clear that the cockpit is reserved for persons with an operational, safety, security or training need.Hardened cockpit doors and restricting cockpit access are the last lines of defence to stop terrorists taking control of a plane. Stringent rules must apply to who can open the hardened cockpit door and enter the cockpit. The regulations were enacted in March and have been in place and effective since then. These regulations closed a loophole in the Aviation Transport Security Regulations. The previous government knew that this loophole existed in late 2005. Indeed, the then Minister for Transport and Regional Services stated in a letter to the pilots union on 16 November of that year:It is Government policy that only those people with a genuine safety, security or operational need have access to the flight deck.The previous government knew there was a loophole but they took no action to fix it because the pilots union successfully lobbied the Howard government.Now that these regulations have been disallowed by the opposition, along with the Greens and the Independents, the legislation regarding cockpit access will return to the state it was prior to the commencement of the regulations which were in place from 12 March of this year. There will be no effective legal restrictions on who can enter a cockpit. There will be no penalties for unauthorised access to the cockpit. Access to the cockpit will effectively be left to industry self-regulation. I am of the view that the government, not the pilots on the plane, should decide regulation on aviation security and safety. That is my view and that is the view of the airlines. It is completely unsatisfactory for such an important measure in such a vital security regime to rely on industry self-regulation. The rules on who can open hardened cockpit doors and enter the cockpit should be set by the parliament, not left to the discretion of pilots and their union.The events in Mexico overnight and the prosecutions in Britain earlier this week remind us that terrorists are targeting planes. I went out of my way, including by making a phone call to the Leader of the Opposition this morning, to secure opposition support for this sensible measure. But I was told that the problem was that we were seeking to impose strict liability. You bet we were! When it comes to security we have to be strict in our liability. The regulations ensure that a pilot can let a person into the cockpit to protect the safety or security of the plane or its passengers. Where there is a medical or other emergency, a pilot's judgment to let a person access the cockpit was not limited at all by this regulation.Of course, when it comes to strict liability offences that apply to pilots this is not a one-off. Civil Aviation Regulations are many. No. 133 says that a pilot in command of an aircraft must not commence a flight if certain requirements are not met. That is very broad. Then No. 140: a pilot in command of an aircraft must not fly the aircraft over a prohibited area. And No. 149: a pilot in command of an aircraft in flight must now tow anything unless authorised to do so by CASA.Do you think any of them are less important than who has access to the cockpit? CAR 138, 141, 157, 161, 163, 171 - all strict liability provisions supported on a bipartisan basis by this parliament. I urge the opposition to come to its senses, support the reintroduction of this regulation and take the advice of the aviation security experts and of the department which made the same recommendations to the previous minister. But he failed to act. I table the examples of strict liability offences.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. I do recall that from the member for Bradfield. I also recall that the member for Bradfield then, I believe, wrote to me as the next step and was then in contact with my office. We were looking at a relevant time for me to go, trying to work through with the member for Bradfield about me attending. I actually followed it up personally at one point because I was keen to spend some time with the member for Bradfield, particularly in circumstances where he had announced that this would be his last parliament. We worked together very closely when I first came to this parliament. I obviously can ascertain from my office where those discussions are up to. I was very enthusiastic to go and I remain very enthusiastic to go and spend some time with the member for Bradfield.More broadly, I say to the shadow minister who asked me the question that it does seem to me passing strange that we are on a day when unemployment figures came out - when the talk of the nation, I think, will be on economic circumstances facing this country during a global recession, about what today's unemployment numbers mean, about what the future will be with unemployment -  - Another performance from an opposition shadow minister bound to convince people that they are ready for government! I say to the shadow minister: I cannot see anybody ever wanting him in charge of Australia's health system. I say to the shadow minister that it does strike me as passing strange on a day when we are dealing with unemployment numbers -  - when people are talking about the impact of the global recession on our economy, when people are concerned about jobs, when we are talking about economic stimulus to support jobs today and when we are talking about an education revolution to overcome almost 12 years of Liberal neglect, that the high point of questioning from the Liberal Party and its supposed attack - the attack it has been working on all weekend and all week, its supposed hard hitting attack on me as minister and on the government generally - has come to a question of whether or not I have attended one individual school. I say to those opposite: if there is a former minister of the Howard government who can honestly walk to the despatch box and say that they responded to - and went - to every invitation that ever came into their office I would be very surprised. 
An opposition member - You offered it. You wanted to go. You stood there and offered it. - I would be very happy to attend a school -  - I doubt the member for Bradfield is saying that he went and did the job to every invite he ever received from anyone when he was minister. - I am going to say about the member for Bradfield though that he is someone who spent a lot of his time going around the country. I think that stood him in good stead in one leadership ballot after the 2007 election. It might not have stood him in enough good stead in the next leadership ballot - but there we have it. I say to the opposition: the big issues in this nation today are issues about which the opposition has absolutely nothing to say. Whilst I have been on my feet - and the member for Bradfield and I can pursue this discussion - I have been advised by my office that we have scheduled time -  -  - Of course the opposition caterwaul, but apparently we had advised his office, well before question time today, that I could be there on 25 September. We are waiting to hear back from his office. If the member for Bradfield wants to return that call, which was made before the shadow minister for education got involved in a matter we were dealing with perfectly competently ourselves, then I will be very happy to go and hang out with him on 25 September.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. The government faces a major challenge to return the budget to surplus after the global financial crisis has punched a $210 billion hole in government revenue and indeed caused a major slump in economic growth. In order to pursue that objective the government has put in place three rules to govern the approach to get the budget back into surplus by 2015-16 on current projections - that is, to allow tax receipts to recover to normal levels as growth resumes, to put in place a two per cent real cap on spending growth once growth has resumed and to require any new spending to be offset by equivalent savings.I noticed this morning in the Australian an interesting article that was headed 'Joe Hockey vows to slash $14bn'. In the text of the article it appeared that the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, was stating that, under a government in which he was Treasurer, government spending as a proportion of GDP would be 24 per cent. I am not quite sure exactly when that 24 per cent would arise under a Liberal government in which the member for North Sydney was Treasurer. As the Treasurer outlined before, were that to occur immediately - for example, in next year's budget - that would mean a cut of almost $50 billion in government spending.Apparently, though, during the course of the day the member for North Sydney has been crab walking away from this commitment. He has explained that in fact what he meant was that it would happen over a number of years, but he did not illuminate precisely how many years or when indeed under a Liberal government the spending rate would get to 24 per cent of GDP. If you look at the figures in the budget, you will see that, although it is currently expected to peak at about 28.6 per cent of GDP because of the global recession and the huge impact on the Australian economy, the budget already projects that that will drop to 26.4 per cent within a few years because of the natural recovery that will occur and because, of course, GDP is higher and, if spending does not grow as fast, the percentage of GDP is lower.It is extraordinarily ironic that, when we are hearing this even more elevated, hairy-chested rhetoric and posturing from the member for North Sydney, at the very same time the opposition is blocking in the Senate one of the government's biggest savings measures. It is blocking one of the biggest reductions in spending - namely, the reforms to the private health insurance rebate which will save the budget almost $2 billion over the next four years and almost $10 billion over 10 years. How on earth can we expect tough decisions from them in government when in opposition they cannot even support getting rid of private health insurance subsidies for millionaires?While the member for North Sydney carries on with this kind of phoney hard man routine, we need to remind the opposition that a day of reckoning is looming. The time will come in the pre-election period when the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney will have to front up and respond to the pre-election fiscal outlook and the existing fiscal settings of the government and outline their spending plans, their savings plans and the net impact on the budget of those plans. If we are to take their current rhetoric seriously, what they will be doing is fronting up and saying, 'Here are our spending plans, here are our savings plans and those savings plans are much larger in dollar outcomes than the spending plans.' In other words, the proposition for those backbenchers over there on the other side is that they will be going into an election campaign promising savage cuts in government services and government programs. That is in effect what the member for North Sydney is saying at the moment. Time will tell whether that is what happens.There are a dozen or so members on the other side who have been in this place about as long as I have and some who have been in here longer, and they will remember that this approach was tried before from opposition. It was tried by a bloke who was also member for Wentworth, who was also an investment banker, who was also a former shadow Treasurer, who was also a proud neoliberal, who was also in only his second term in parliament and who also had impeccable nouveau riche credentials. His name, of course, was John Hewson. So where they are heading under the rhetoric of the member for North Sydney is a rerun of Fightback. Time will tell whether that is where they end up.I am a bit more cynical because I think what will happen is that, as we get to that day of reckoning, all the debt and deficit rhetoric is going to be exposed for the vacuous nonsense that it is. They will not be stumping up with the hard savings that are needed in order to follow through on their rhetoric. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition say that everything will be reviewed and everything is up for grabs. Let's see what actually happens when we come to the business end of the season, because I know and we know that it is all empty rhetoric. There is nothing behind these posturings by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney. We know and the members on the back benches hope that when it comes to the election campaign they will not be out there proposing the kinds of savage cuts that they pretend they currently stand for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It may enable me -  -  - and I think I am assisted by my colleagues in this regard - to explain something about the way the Australian economy works. Although a firm may ultimately have an overseas owner, when they work in this country they actually employ people in this country to do the work. Just try to stay with me on that economic concept that a company that may have an ultimate overseas owner, when it does work in this country, employs Australians to do jobs.Do you know why construction is a great way of providing economic stimulus? It is because it is necessarily providing work here in this country in an industry hit by the global recession. I refer the member - and he may not be familiar with it - to the recent statistics and index released by the Australian Industry Group that showed that employment in construction had gone down 17 months in a row. - Apart from explaining that a company can have an ultimate foreign owner and actually employ Australians, one of the other things about the construction industry that people may not appreciate - or at the least the member asking me the question may not appreciate; I suspect everybody on this side of the House does, and I reckon the Independents are right onto this as well - is that in the construction industry it is common to engage a head contractor who then contracts down the chain to subcontractors -  
Government members - Oh, really? - Really. Yes, imagine that - a head contractor who contracts down the chain to subcontractors who then perform the work. Having met with a number of people who are actually engaged in constructing Building the Education Revolution projects, I know that is precisely what is happening. - So the subcontracting happens down the chain; I have met people who are engaged in that process. With the Building the Education Revolution program there is a working-through of local employment plans and there is also a requirement that 10 per cent of hours be allocated to supporting apprentices and trainees and people who are learning whilst they are doing the job so that they too can be supported during these difficult days of the global recession.I say in conclusion to the member that what has been concerning me is: what is the opposition theme? What is bringing together their comments, their statements, their attacks and their questions in question time today? I really want to thank the member who asked this question because I think I can finally see it. We have a G20 left-wing conspiracy! Angela Merkel is in on it! German companies are somehow building things in Australia, not employing any Australian workers, and as part of this global Leftist conspiracy somehow, with no Australian employment, buildings are getting built by German companies with Angela Merkel right in the centre of it - and we have got the shadow Treasurer from Deutsche Bank! I cannot wait for the next episode!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question because I know that the electorate that he represents has very many people on low and middle incomes who do not fancy subsidising the private health insurance of millionaires, of CEOs and of those of us who are here in parliament when we are well able to pay for our own private health insurance. The Rudd government announced changes at the budget because we believe that it is possible for us to make the private health insurance rebate (1) more fair and (2) more sustainable.It might be of interest for those opposite to know that spending on the current rebate is growing so quickly that it is expected to double as a proportion of health expenditure by 2046. This is clearly unsustainable - even more so in light of the global financial crisis. We believe that it is a fairer use of taxpayer resources to make sure that secretaries, nurses, Hansard reporters and attendants in the chamber do not have to pay for the private health insurance of members in this place who are well able to pay for it themselves.This is not our money we are talking about. This is taxpayers' money and we need to ensure that every health dollar is targeted to those who need its support most. But this morning, as the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and others have commented, I noticed that the shadow Treasurer vowed to cut $14 billion in spending not even 24 hours after his own party blew a hole in the budget of $1.9 billion. It really shows that, once you put the blowtorch to the Liberal Party, they cannot stand for anything, they cannot be fiscally responsible and they do not have the ticker to make any tough decisions. We can see a clear pattern emerging from the Liberal Party. When they are given a choice about who they are going to back, it is the very highly paid specialists, the health insurers or the distillers. They will stand with everybody possible who earns a high income rather than stand with the community and sensible health policy. We intend to reintroduce this bill into the parliament. We believe that it is fairer, we believe that it is financially sustainable, and we expect a more responsible approach from the opposition when we do reintroduce it. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gippsland for his question and his drawing my attention to one school in his electorate. His electorate is home to 104 schools. Those 104 schools are benefiting from 190 projects under the Building the Education Revolution program with an investment of more than $117 million, so I certainly look forward to the member continuing to ask me questions. He has asked me about one school today and I will very much welcome questions about the other 103 schools and the 190 projects in his electorate. -  - I say to the member for Gippsland that I think he will find, with 190 projects in his electorate and an investment of $117 million, that will be supporting local jobs, and if I know the form of the member for Gippsland can I just predict that he will be there associating himself with the openings of each of those projects. We will see him in a hard hat before the end of the year. I will put money on it. I will also put money on the fact that by the end of the year I and a number of my colleagues will have got letters from the member for Gippsland asking for more investment in his electorate. I am sure that will be happening, too.On the question of costs and Building the Education Revolution, as the member for Gippsland would know because I am sure he is familiar with the $117 million investment and 190 projects in 104 schools in his electorate, contracting and tendering for the state schools is being managed by the state government and for Catholic and independent schools by the relevant school authorities. We obviously work with them to get value for money. The member has referred to cost blow-outs. I believe he is confused with the Investing in Our Schools Program where there was an underestimate through costing at 80 per cent and a consequent need to go back to budget and get extra money.If the member for Gippsland has an issue that he is concerned about, if he wants to work through that, obviously we want to ensure that the best possible value for money is obtained in local schools in his area and around the country. Can I say to the member for Gippsland more broadly that when he is dealing with these issues - he may have spoken to the principal he cites or he may have spoken to the local tenderer - I hope that he is making clear in each and every one of those conversations that when he was asked in this parliament to vote for this investment in schools and in supporting local jobs he voted against it.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question on the status of the Montara oil and gas leak. In doing so, I would also join with her in welcoming the Prime Minister's announcements today with respect to further long-term LNG contracts by Chevron. These contracts are potentially worth $70 billion over 25 years to Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas, in Japan, in addition to GS Caltex, in South Korea, and hopefully will further assist in a final decision by the Gorgon joint venture. In doing so, I remind the House not only of the economic importance of the LNG industry to Australia but also of the environmental importance to the industry internationally. One should not forget that for every tonne of CO2 emitted in Australia during production, LNG saves four tonnes of CO2 when it is consumed in Japan and nine tonnes when it is consumed in China.For those reasons - both environmental and economic - we as a nation have a huge responsibility to make sure that the petroleum industry in Australia operates on the best conditions regarding health and safety practices and environmental considerations. I can advise the House that AMSA has indicated there has been a general reduction in the number and size of slick patches observed. The report indicates that fewer patches are being sighted from vessels, with only a very small amount of dispersant having been required yesterday. It is also interesting to note - contrary to suggestions from the Greens - that the oil slick and sheen are approximately 170 kilometres, or 90 nautical miles, from the mainland. More importantly, in terms of our capacity to actually shut in the leaking well, the Montara well operator, PTTEP, today advised that the West Triton rig - which has been brought from Indonesia to shut in the leaking well and then stop the flow of oil and gas - is scheduled to arrive at the Montara field at midnight this evening. From an environmental point of view, wildlife experts and environmental personnel are conducting surveys and wildlife monitoring of Ashmore Reef and the East and West Middle Islands. The latest report available to me indicates no oil-affected wildlife and no evidence of contamination in the area, which is pleasing to all in the House.As I have previously advised the House, this is a major incident but we should not forget that this is the first well blow-out in offshore oil and gas in Australia since 1984, and around 1,500 wells have been drilled safely over the past 25 years. However, we also accept that there is no room for complacency. The oil and gas industry - as confirmed by the Prime Minister today - is one of the engine rooms of growth in Australia and the key to critical investment and job creation as we come out of this global financial crisis.This is also about energy security for Australia in the 21st century as we move toward a lower emissions economy. But we should also never forget that the nature of the industry is hazardous to the people and the environment when things go wrong. It is for that reason that all members of the House have taken the status of the Montara oil and gas leak seriously. We understand that the Australian community rightly expects no less from all of us. I therefore extend my appreciation to the opposition, and especially to the member for Groom, for assisting me in facilitating an amendment to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, which will provide the minister with a broad ranging major incident investigation power. That amendment passed the House yesterday, and we now look forward to support from the Senate so as to enable the minister to have the appropriate regulatory capacity to conduct an investigation once we have completed shutting in the well and stopping the flow of oil and gas.Clearly, there is a need for a regulatory review power and consideration of a properly resourced investigative capacity from the Australian government. However, we also understand that this is an unfortunate incident. I remind the House that right now our top priorities are: firstly, to respond to the oil spill and minimise harm to the environment; and, secondly - and importantly - to shut in the leaking well and stop the flow of oil and gas safely and as soon as possible. I extend my appreciation to the House for its assistance in amending the bill to ensure that we have all regulatory capacity to do the right thing by the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Obviously I welcome the Auditor-General's report, and a performance audit is underway. All things to be done to cooperate with the Auditor-General are being done, and we should have his report, hopefully, I believe, by the end of the year - though, of course, ultimately, the time frames are a matter for the Auditor-General.On the question of what the opposition say about the Building the Education Revolution, I still await the list I asked for from the opposition of which schools they believe should not get funded. They voted against funding in every school - all 9,500 - and they voted against funding for 24,000 projects. They come into this parliament and they talk about waste. Well, just table the list that shows -  - Every day we have an opposition spokesperson say a different thing about funding for Building the Education Revolution. On some days, the shadow Treasurer makes it clear that they would not fund it at all. On other days, the Leader of the Opposition says they would fund a program a quarter of the size. And the shadow minister for education tries to get caught saying nothing about funding. But at some point the opposition have to come clean and say to the Australian people, 'Here's a list of 9,500 schools and here are the ones that the Liberal Party believe should not be funded.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Oxley for his question. One year ago today the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers triggered the gravest financial and economic crisis the world had seen since the great crash of 1929. Within days, Merrill Lynch was absorbed by the Bank of America in a deal brokered by and financed by the US government. The world's largest insurance company, AIG, was then nationalised by the US government under a public administration. Thirdly, the mortgage lender Washington Mutual was shut down. And in time we saw some 50 of the world's major banks either declared bankrupt or bailed out by their respective government or by other mechanisms.The total losses and write-downs across the global financial system and the private institutions within it should provide us all with pause for reflection - a staggering $1.9 trillion plus, and the bill is rising. The head of the IMF said at the time - and it is worth while that honourable members reflect on this because we did stand at the abyss of the implosion of the world's financial system - 'The global financial system is on the brink of systemic meltdown.' No other statement has been made by the head of the IMF to that effect. That is where we stood in the critical week following the Lehman Brothers collapse last year.The fact that we all stood at the abyss was underlined by the fact that global financial markets then subsequently froze. Global private credit flows to Australian banks collapsed to zero in the months of October and November last year. For the information of honourable members, normal capital inflows into private financial institutions in this economy would run at about $10 billion a month - up or down depending on the month in question. They collapsed to zero. Furthermore, domestic raisings by Australian banks also froze. As a further indication of that, the interbank spreads, which normally run at around 10 basis points, elevated to 350 basis points - itself a market indication that the financial flows across the private financial system of the global economy had frozen. And in the absence of capital flows, the real economy in turn then freezes. In short, global financial markets had panicked - and panicked comprehensively - and credit was denied to institutions even with the most impeccable of balance sheets. Again to quote the IMF at the time - to place the events of the last 12 months into context - they said: 'This is the most dangerous shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s.'As financial markets teetered at the abyss, equity markets for a time went over the abyss. Some US$30 trillion was wiped off the value of global stock markets. That is an amount equal almost to half of the total value of global GDP - to place it into its context. The US stock market fell from peak to trough by 55 per cent. Compare that with the stock market crash of 1987, where the stock market collapsed by 33 per cent. In Australia we had a 55 per cent collapse in the stock market from peak to trough. That contrasted with a 50 per cent collapse back in 1987. The implications for Australian households, through the superannuation earnings of Australian families, have been huge. Last November, Alan Greenspan described the crisis as a 'once-in-a-century event'.The freezing of financial markets and the collapse of stock markets, of course, in turn impacted on the real economy. These are the challenges we have been wrestling with here as well. Twenty-nine out of the 33 advanced economies fell into recession. Thirty-two of the 33 advanced economies over the last 12 months have contracted. All of the major advanced economies have gone into recession. This has been the worst global economic collapse in three-quarters of a century. The IMF began collecting data back in 1950. Again, if you go back to the data, you can see that at no time since 1950 has the global economy actually shrunk - until the IMF's projection for 2009, when it projected it shrinking by 1.3 per cent.Again, it is worth putting this into context: in the recession of the early 1980s the global economy was still growing, albeit marginally, at 0.9 per cent; in the recession of the early nineties the global economy was still growing, at 1.5 per cent; in the Asian financial crisis the global economy was still growing at plus 3.2 per cent; and even with the tech wreck of the early 2000s the global economy was still growing at 2.1 per cent. Of course, all this flows from financial markets through equity markets through the real economies on to employment. What we have seen, of course, is the real impact for working people across the world. The G7 average unemployment rate has gone up to 8.2 per cent - across the OECD, to 8.3 per cent. The US unemployment level is, as we know, 9.7 per cent. In Europe, I notice in particular Spain, with 15-plus per cent, it seems, on some of the most recent reporting that I have seen. Some 12 billion jobs have been lost across the advanced economies alone. When we say the global economy has faced its worst crisis in 75 years, this is the data that underpins that proposition, and the data is unassailable. This has been a crisis of extraordinary dimensions by any measure; therefore, the response to it by governments both globally and nationally has had to be equally extraordinary to avoid a repeat of the Great Depression. Thanks to the leadership demonstrated by the United States under President Bush and continued under President Obama, through the agency of the G20, the global economy so far has avoided that outcome.The Washington summit, convened by President Bush, set an unprecedented agenda for global cooperation. The London summit which followed took four or five specific decisions which have turned back so much of the global economic tide: firstly, some $5 trillion worth of stimulus agreed across the 20 largest economies in the world, including our own; secondly, an international framework for managing toxic assets within impaired bank balance sheets, caused by the problems I referred to before; thirdly, a resourcing by $1 trillion of the IMF to deal with further emergencies arising with private banks in many of the distressed regions of the world, most particularly Central and Eastern Europe; fourthly, a comprehensive reform agenda going to the heart of the financial regulations which so demonstrably failed in the time leading up to the crisis in the first place; and fifthly, most critically, a resolve across governments not to indulge, as they did in the 1930s, in a breakout of protectionist measures one against the other. This was the resolve of those governments, a resolve which has been in the main adhered to.This points ahead to the third G20 summit, which will occur in Pittsburgh next week. The agenda for the G20 summit at Pittsburgh goes to a range of specific policy measures again aimed at bringing back the global economy from the brink through recovery and on to long-term reconstruction. The IMF has pointed to the impact of the London summit, in a study it has done, as having 'broken the fall' in the global economic collapse which occurred after the implosion of Lehman Brothers one year ago. That summit in London, chaired by Prime Minister Brown, convened by the United States through the overall agency of the G20, brought about a series of outcomes which effectively broke the fall. - Because of the significance of this day 12 months ago, I thought it was important to inform the House what has been done in response to a virtually unprecedented economic crisis. I have outlined two meetings of the G20; I will now come to the third. That is the Pittsburgh agenda, which looms next month.Whatever national actions have been undertaken by the parliament and by the government of Australia in our national stimulus strategy, they pale into insignificance against global actions which have been taken through the agency of the G20. Firstly, the stimulus measures that I referred to before need to continue to be implemented, as affirmed recently by the G20 finance ministers. Secondly, there is the question - as proposed by a number of governments - of how to coordinate effective medium-term exit strategies from the extraordinary interventions which all governments have had to engage in, in fiscal policy but also in the monetary policy actions undertaken by our respective central banks. Thirdly, there is the issue of the development of a long-term new sustainable growth model for the future of the global economy which does not simply rest on a return to business as usual - in terms of high levels of North-East Asian and Middle Eastern credit exports, as surplus economies, to high levels of debt driven consumption in economies such as the United States - as that is unlikely to occur. This poses the core question for anyone seriously engaged in this debate around the world, which is: where will the next increment of global economic growth come from? That should seize the attention of all honourable members, because, unless that question is answered globally, actions taken nationally will again pale into insignificance.Finally, we need to implement the agenda of financial market regulation reform which was initiated both in Washington and in London in terms of three specific areas where work is being concentrated: (1) the capital requirements of financial institutions, in particular the largest ones with systemic significance for the global economy; (2) executive remuneration in financial institutions around the world; and (3) how to deal with what is described by the Financial Stability Board and others as financial institutions too big to fail. These are important areas of reform. Pittsburgh, it is hoped, will achieve progress in each of these categories, and it is important that this reform agenda be continued into the future.For the benefit of the House's attention, I have spoken on these matters at length today for this reason: 12 months ago, with the implosion of Lehman's, we all teetered at the abyss. In the 12 months since then - in substantial measure because of the leadership shown by the United States of America, through the convening of the G20, and the coordinated global actions undertaken through that agency - this global economy has come back from the abyss. As a result of those actions coordinated by the United States, Australia's interests have been well served by American leadership through the G20, and I would have thought that all members of this House would have been united in a positive response to this strong exercise of US global leadership.</DOC>

 - I would say, particularly following the Prime Minister's answer, that in the middle of a global recession the Leader of the Opposition may like to note that the importance of the Building the Education Revolution Program and consequently delivering it quickly is about supporting jobs today - the jobs of tradespeople, of carpenters, plumbers and electricians - whilst building the biggest school modernisation in the nation's history. Of course, he refers to one project out of more than 24,000 projects in 9,500 schools around the country. Given the inability of the opposition to answer my last question to it, a question I have asked before, in detail, we can only assume that this is a project that the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to - just like he is opposed to each of the more than 24,000 others. The Leader of the Opposition may choose to go to Abbotsford Public School and explain that he is opposed to this project, he is opposed to every dollar of expenditure and he is opposed to every job that this project will support. - If I could conclude that point, obviously the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to the project at Abbotsford Public School. He voted against it. Every member of the opposition voted against it. The Abbotsford Public School has decided that it would like to access the Building the Education Revolution Program and the resources in money that that program brings. The Leader of the Opposition is opposed to every dollar of expenditure on the Abbotsford Public School. Discussions are in train with the Abbotsford Public School about their program, and I would make the point to the Leader of the Opposition that if he chose to go to schools around the country, if he chose to walk into them and if he chose to be honest that he is opposed to the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history and the jobs that it supports, he would actually find principals, parents and teachers who disagree with him - who believe that this is important to their school, that this is important to their local community and that it is are delivering programs that they want and projects that their school very much wants.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much to the member for Braddon for his question, thank you very much to the Speaker for the call and thank you to the shadow minister for education for interjecting 'mass distraction'. That is obviously what he thinks the Leader of the Opposition is, because this question refers to recent statements by the Leader of the Opposition.As members of this House would recall, the heart of Work Choices was Australian workplace agreements that stripped away pay and conditions, and information from May 2006 gave us great evidence of just how bad those rip-offs that the Liberal Party endorsed were, with 63 per cent of AWAs ripping off penalty rates, endorsed by the Liberal Party; 51 per cent ripping off overtime loadings, endorsed by the Liberal Party; and 46 per cent ripping off public holiday pay, endorsed by the Liberal Party. AWAs are the rip-off at the heart of Work Choices.The Leader of the Opposition from time to time has tried to say to the Australian people that he understands their concerns about these Liberal endorsed rip-offs. For example, the Leader of the Opposition on 25 May 2008 said, 'Work Choices is dead. The people have spoken.' Of course, on 26 November -  -  - I understand that whenever the member for Warringah is near a microphone people become concerned about a word being used that is not suitable for daytime TV. Of course, in my answer I am referring to - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. I thank him for so clearly going through my portfolio titles. If he wants a summary, we of course stand for fairness and decency in education and at work. You stand for neither - neither fairness nor decency. That was made very clear by the Leader of the Opposition on the weekend, and it is made clear every day by your shadow minister through his absence of policies. - The member for Mitchell raises with me a Building the Education Revolution project in his electorate. There are 41 schools in his electorate. They have been awarded 93 projects at a cost of just over $81 million. I think it is to be regretted that he opposes each and every one of those projects in each and every one of his 41 schools. He has raised with me the details of an individual project. Obviously I would need to check the assertions in his question - I have found out, by dint of long experience, that most of the questions raised by the opposition do not stand up to any scrutiny when the claims are held up to the light. But I will look at the assertion that the member for Mitchell has made and will come back to him about the matter. I trust that, in the same spirit, he will go back to each of his 41 schools and explain to them that he is opposed to expenditure in those schools, he is opposed to the new projects, he is opposed to assistance to schools in 9,500 schools around the nation and he is opposed to the local jobs that it will support.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question, because it has been a difficult year in the global economy. Australia, through a combination of circumstances - including economic stimulus and fantastic community effort - has come through this global recession in far better shape than the rest of the world. But, as the IMF recently warned, it would be dangerous to assume that the crisis is now over - around the world but also locally we are still facing big challenges. One of those challenges is rising unemployment. Last week's unemployment figures showed that employment fell by 27,100 people last month. The number of unemployed Australians has risen by something like 200,000 people over the past year. Regrettably, I think unemployment will continue to rise as the effects of the global recession do continue to wash through our economy.That is why jobs are so central - front and centre - to this government's economic strategy. We do understand the damaging impact of unemployment on an economy, on families, on business and on the wider community. We, in particular, understand the damage that unemployment does to those families that are caught in the cycle of unemployment. That is why the statements by the shadow Treasurer last Thursday were so damaging and why they really demonstrate the lack of understanding of the shadow Treasurer and those opposite. He said that jobs were not the No. 1 economic priority of the Liberal and National parties in this parliament. This is quite a change of heart from the shadow Treasurer because on 23 April he said this:Every single sinew of the Government's body must be focused on creating jobs, building jobs. It must be focused on how to preserve jobs.What a change of heart we have had from the shadow Treasurer in recent times. And in the space of one week the shadow Treasurer has had a shocker. In the space of one week jobs have gone from being the top priority to a second order priority. On Thursday he announced a $50 billion a year savings target for those opposite. Truly spectacular! Then we had his leftist conspiracy in the G20. And then we had a rebuke from the World Bank - all in the space of a couple of days.What this demonstrates is how those opposite have misjudged the global recession. They have misjudged its causes and they have misjudged the response. And so important to the response here has been that Australians have pulled together. They have come together working with the government to support employment. What is the new idea that those opposite have got this week? It is to bring back Work Choices. What a combination - to oppose stimulus and bring back Work Choices. It shows how those opposite have no grasp of the challenges facing this country. What they will do is push people down. What we on this side of the House will do is build them up. Those on that side of the House have no conception of what is required to support employment and the Australian people in a global recession.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Unfortunately, in response I feel like I should be giving a grade 5 or 6 social studies or civics course. Yes, there is a national government in this country; that is true. There are state and territory governments in this country; that is true as well. There are actually local governments, but I do not want to confuse the member - I seriously do not - so let us just stick to the first two. And then there are schools in this country that are not operated by either level of government but are operated either independently or by the Catholic Church through Catholic education authorities. - It may, the Prime Minister is reminding me, possibly be in the member's mind that this is all located in some G20 leftist conspiracy. The interconnections are not clear to me but maybe to Fox Mulder of The X Files over there they are. Maybe the truth is out there.The way that Building the Education Revolution works, of course, is that the federal government, to support jobs during a global recession - and I know the shadow minister has not heard of that - determined it was appropriate to provide economic stimulus to the economy. We determined it was appropriate to do that in part through the biggest school modernisation program the nation has ever seen. Seventy per cent of our economic stimulus was delivered by way of productive infrastructure for the future, including modernising schools. Having made that determination, we entered into agreements with state and territory governments, independent schools authorities and the Catholic schools authorities. We have worked with them on the delivery of this program. It is as simple as that. Whether or not the shadow minister is capable of understanding it is quite another question.</DOC>

 - I am actually happy to give the call to the member for O'Connor, because it is a terrific insight into the opposition's industrial relations policy, and I guess their women's policy as well. Home in the kitchen, eh! All right, good! I want to thank the member for Page for her question. It was a very good question. It certainly did not deserve that interjection. Of course, both men and women need a fair industrial relations system, but we know that -  -  - I hear the blokes up the back. - We know that women in Australia have been more dependent on awards to underpin basic pay and conditions than men. About one in five working women is reliant on an award, compared with about 13 per cent of working men. So the safety net that is provided by the award system has always been more important for vulnerable workers and for many women workers.We had so many examples during Work Choices of pay and conditions being stripped away from working women. The system was undermined by having the rug pulled out from under it. There were the Spotlight workers asked to give up their leave and loading for an extra 2c an hour. There was the vegetable packer who saw her hourly rate fall from $16 an hour to $11 an hour after Work Choices. There was Janis, a cleaner, who had to apply for her own job after more than 30 years with her firm. There was Marianne, sacked without notice by her employer by email - example after example.We also know that women who were on AWAs earnt significantly less than women who are on award pay or collective agreements. In fact, women on AWAs actually earnt about $90 a week less than women on collective agreements did. We know also that the gender pay gap - the difference between women's earnings and men's earnings - was much greater for women on AWAs compared with women on collective agreements. We know that the Work Choices system and AWAs in particular made balancing work and family much more difficult. Only about a quarter of AWAs had family-friendly provisions. That is not good for men or women, but we know that working women in particular are often the ones who have to make the arrangements to pick the kids up from child care. - I was just making the point about AWAs making it very difficult -  - I was just making the point about the difficulty of balancing work and family for many people who were on AWAs - the difficulty of knowing when you could pick your kids up, knowing what sorts of after-school things you could commit yourself to when you did not know when you would be working from day to day or week to week.The Fair Work Act restores the balance that the opposition wants to take away, by extending equal remuneration provisions to include the right to equal pay for work of equal or comparable value, by allowing variation of modern awards for work value reasons, by strengthening the safety net and measures relating to women's workforce participation, by providing access to multi-employer bargaining for the low paid and by enhancing protections from workplace discrimination. Work Choices and AWAs were killed stone dead by the Australian people at the time of the last election. There were many Australian women who voted against Work Choices partly because they were concerned about their own pay and conditions but partly because of the work environment that they wanted their kids and grandkids to have as they grew up. They voted against it and, if the Leader of the Opposition resurrects Work Choices and resurrects AWAs, they will vote against it again.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the member for Mackellar there is something about Building the Education Revolution that she has not quite realised, and that is that Building the Education Revolution is all about getting money to schools, money that she and the Liberal Party are opposed to delivering to schools. So let's just get it clear in her mind: this side of the House supports giving resources to schools and her side of the House does not.When a Member is speaking, no Member may converse aloud or make any noise or disturbance to interrupt the Member.That applies to the member for Sturt as well. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call. She is responding to the question. - Can I say -  - Can I answer the member for Mackellar's question by saying to her: Building the Education Revolution is about getting resources to schools. Any suggestion that the school at Abbotsford is somehow paying these consultancy costs out of its own resources is -  - absolutely absurd. - Of course, the question of administrative costs is dealt with in the Building the Education Revolution guidelines: administrative costs at 1.5 per cent of the program. The question of project costs has been dealt with between the federal government and the state and territory governments and block grant authorities who are delivering this program, and that deals with the industry standard of four per cent. I understand from the member for Mackellar's question that she is quite interested in hypotheticals. Well, if she is quite interested in hypotheticals, here is a hypothetical for her: just imagine if the Liberal Party had won the 2007 election. If that had happened then today there would not be economic stimulus, there would not be support for jobs, unemployment would be higher, there would not be the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history -  - And if the Liberal Party had been elected then the 49 schools in her electorate would not be benefiting from 104 projects at more than $90 million. And if the Liberal Party were ever re-elected then presumably they would do everything they could to rip this money back out of schools, because they have opposed it every step of the way.</DOC>

I know she cares about fairness and decency at work, and I know that, like Australians around the country, she was appalled at the Liberal Party's Work Choices rip-offs. She was appalled that working people had penalty rates ripped off them. She was appalled that working people had redundancy pay ripped off them without a cent of compensation. She was appalled that good workers were dismissed for no reason at all, with no remedy. And she campaigned for the return of fairness and decency at work and the end of Work Choices. The member for Kingston, like other Australians, may have been entitled to think, when the Leader of the Opposition went out to the Australian people and said, 'Work Choices is dead,' that he meant it. But, of course, from the weekend, we know that the Leader of the Opposition is so out of touch that he believes the solution, in the middle of a global recession, is to have laws that enable working Australians to lose basic pay and conditions including penalty rates.People might be wondering to themselves, 'How on earth did the Leader of the Opposition come to this conclusion - apart from personally being so out of touch?' Well, he does not have very good advisers amongst his political party and his backbench. Starting with his advisers from the backbench, we have the member for O'Connor, who, clearly, in interjections when the Minister for Housing -  - That's right! When the Minister for Housing was dealing with the question of pay and conditions -  - I thank the shadow minister for her turn of phrase, because she is right: Work Choices is vindictive nonsense, and it is just a pity that that is what the Liberal Party stands for. But in coming to this position in support of Work Choices and all of its rip-offs, we have got the advice from the member for O'Connor. He was clearly interjecting, when the Minister for Housing was on her feet, suggesting that it is fine for women workers to be required to work on weekends, and they ought to be grateful for the job, and questions of minimum wages really should not come into it. And he is on the public record as verifying this position, not only in the parliament in interjections but in the media today. I quote from a very illuminating statement from the member for O'Connor as he was walking into Parliament House today. He said:I made my maiden speech in 1981 - That is quite a long time ago - on industrial relations and questioned the stupidity in our modern society of penalty rates within the 38-hour parameters, I think it was 40 then, for weekends and evenings - </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and note in passing that Professor McKibbin has not been a consistent fan of government policy for some time - either on the question of the economy, climate change or a range of other matters. That is simply a matter of public record. The Leader of the Opposition asked me about the government's stimulus strategy. In my response to an earlier question today I referred to it being 12 months since the Lehman Brothers crisis and to what the global economy has done through the G20 - and what we are still seeking to do through the G20 - because the global economy was at the abyss. One of the things that the global economy resolved to do through the G20 was coordinate global economic stimulus through fiscal measures. That is what was agreed upon at the London summit in March-April this year.Furthermore, the representatives of those G20 economies, meeting most recently in London last weekend - and I seem to recall the Treasurer informing the House about this last week - including all those socialists from France, Germany, Italy and from Saudi Arabia, all said that in fact they were committed and must remain committed to the full implementation of the stimulus measures that they had agreed upon in London. And the reason for that was that the global economic recovery was far from certain and far from concluded. Therefore Australia, together with the other 19 significant economies at that gathering, as they were in London in April, has embarked upon this collective course of action.Also, within Australia we have acted on the basis of advice from the Treasury. We have acted on the basis also of the concerted -  - I see the shadow Treasurer is again attacking Mr Henry; is that right? -  - I notice that those opposite often have a go at the Secretary to the Treasury. I seem to recall that those opposite have done so from time to time in the past. - If the shadow Treasurer was not having a go at the Secretary to the Treasury, as the opposition has done on many occasions in the past, then of course I stand corrected.The government in our response to the global economic crisis, the global economic recession and the financial crisis in embarking upon our three-stage stimulus strategy have done so consistent with the advice provided to us by our economic advisers in the Treasury. Furthermore, our strategy has been complementary to the expansionary policy adopted by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and the 425 basis point changes that it has made to official interest rates. The reason we have done that is that we have been acting in concert with other global economies, seeking to respond to the worst global economic crisis in three-quarters of a century.The Leader of the Opposition asks also about where this fiscal stimulus strategy will go in the future. I would draw his attention to the fact that the stimulus strategy is structured in a number of stages - three, in particular - and furthermore that the way in which the strategy has been conceived, developed and implemented is such that it will peak as the private economy is at its weakest and then contract as the private economy responds. That is what you should do with a stimulus strategy to make sure it is targeted, that it is temporary and that it therefore has an effect. It is entirely consistent with conservative economic management. When the public economy expands to occupy the space left by a private sector in retreat and when the private sector expands itself then the public economy through public investment should contract at that point. That is the way in which the stimulus strategy is constructed. In fact, I seem to recall that in 2008-09 we have had about 2.1 per cent of GDP which has gone out. In 2009-10 it will be something like 2.2 per cent or 2.3 per cent of GDP. Then it will fall to 1.4 per cent of GDP and then down to less than 0.4 per cent of GDP. In other words, it is constructed in a manner such that it was at its maximum intensity when the global economy was at its weakest and therefore is contracting, as it has been designed to, as the global economy slowly recovers.The other point that has been made by the Leader of the Opposition today concerns interest rates. I find it passing strange that anyone from the opposition could stand here credibly and ask a question about interest rates. They went to the election before last saying they would keep interest rates at record lows and then proceeded to bring about how many interest rate rises in a row? Ten. But they stand at the dispatch box and ask us questions about interest rates. Furthermore, apart from having zero credibility on interest rates, I would also say to those opposite the following: when you look at the impact of global public borrowings on interest rates, as has been said repeatedly by many public economists, the impact of Australia's total borrowing on total global public debt is something in the order of 0.003 -  - The shadow Treasurer interjects again. I would draw his attention to commentaries such as those by Ross Gittins in the financial pages of the paper where he was described roundly as an economic illiterate for assuming that the impact of Australia's public borrowing would in turn have a direct effect on interest rates. That is simply illogical because of the fundamental underpinning fact that our overall borrowings represent such a small slice of total global public debt. Therefore, the proposition being advanced by the opposition is one of absolute fiction and fear which has no underpinnings in fact. Those opposite would understand that if they were being honest about their reflections on this.I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition. It goes to why we have embarked upon this economic stimulus strategy and how we have structured it in three stages and over time in order for it to have its maximum effect when the economy is at its weakest and then to contract as the global economy recovers. The stimulus strategy is consistent with both the global advice of the IMF and the World Bank and advice nationally within Australia from the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is a stimulus strategy which I would suggest that those opposite, if they were honest about it, would agree is having a positive effect. Firstly, at this stage of September 2009, across the 33 members of the OECD Australia uniquely over the last 12 months is the economy which has grown. Secondly, we are the only major economy not to have gone into recession. Thirdly, we have the second lowest unemployment, the lowest debt and the lowest deficit of the major advanced economies. And, on top of that, we are the only economy not to have gone into recession. Those opposite regard that as a scorecard of economic failure.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question because not only is this decision important for her state; it is important for the nation. Today the Minister for Resources and Energy is in Perth witnessing the final development approval by the Premier of Western Australia, essentially giving the go-ahead to the Gorgon LNG development. This go-ahead locks in the largest resource project in Australia's history. This House has heard over the last few weeks about important long-term gas contracts that have been secured, importantly, with China, with India, with Japan and with Korea, but today's announcement equals the sum of those parts plus, because it is projected that the Gorgon LNG development will involve $300 billion in export earnings over its life.Not only is this great news for the Australian economy as a whole; it is great news for job opportunities going forward. If one thinks of the development, it is a $43 billion development project. ACIL Economics has estimated that, over the life of this project, it will boost Australia's GDP by some $65 billion and it will generate government revenues of $40 billion - and just think of how important that is going to be in terms of continuing this government's investment in the nation's future, in its schools, in its skills, in its innovation, in its research and development and in its infrastructure. The project will also return more than $33 billion to the economy through the use of Australian goods and services throughout the nation. So far as jobs are concerned, it is estimated that it will create at the peak of its construction 10,000 jobs and, over the life of the project, 3½ thousand direct and indirect jobs. The Prime Minister announced last week the National Resource Sector Employment Taskforce. This is important to ensure that, as this and other resource developments go ahead, we have not only the job opportunities but the skills to undertake them.Finally, I would just observe the point that, whilst this is a hugely important announcement, this will not be just an example of Australia exporting the resource. It is also the expertise and the carbon capture storage technology that is involved in this - it is the much greater comparative advantage that Australia holds not just as a supplier of a resource but as the supplier of clean resource energies, which themselves will command a premium going forward as the globe grapples with the challenge of climate change. This is Australia's comparative advantage. It is only one dimension of it but a huge impetus, a huge fillip, to it. This demonstrates Australia's contribution and its ability to play as a global and clean energy superpower - quality, cleaner: this is a brand Australia should be proud of and it is something that we as a government are very happy to be supportive of.</DOC>

 - I do really welcome this question from the shadow Treasurer. The proposition that the economic stimulus in this country is somehow going to lead to a rise in global interest rates is simply bizarre, because the truth is this: interest rates in Australia are partially a function of global factors -  - Mr Speaker -  - Borrowing rates are governed by market rates, which are influenced by a range of factors, most particularly global factors and global forces, and of course they are also influenced by short-term domestic rates. This is just a fact.The member for North Sydney then left the chamber. - So the interest rates in this country are influenced by global factors. They are also influenced by decisions on the short-term rate taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia. But the suggestion, as the Prime Minster was saying before, that somehow borrowing by the Australian government is going to push up rates here and globally is bizarre. Of course, this point has been made, I think very plainly, by one commentator, Mr Gittins. The shadow Treasurer wanted to quote others, but we should quote Mr Gittins. He had this to say: 'Hockey's argument about the effect of government borrowing on interest rates is simply wrong.' He continued:In that vast, global market, our Government's borrowings are a flea bite, quite unable to influence the level of global interest rates.Mr Gittins went on in that article to out the strategy of the Liberal and National parties, which is to run another John Howard scare campaign on interest rates. That is what is going on here - it does not matter what the facts are; do not let any of the facts get in the way. They are so embarrassed by their opposition to economic stimulus that they have to run a scare campaign on interest rates which is factually incorrect and which will be seen through by the Australian people.The Australian people understand what the Liberal Party are up to at the moment. They absolutely understand that the Liberal Party will put the jobs of Australians last, behind their political manoeuvring in this parliament. They will never support jobs. They will come into this House and play politics. - The shadow Treasurer used to be the minister for pay cuts in his former life, and he now comes in here as the shadow Treasurer - the shadow Treasurer for job cuts. That explains the very clear difference between both sides of the House. At the height of a global recession, jobs are the No. 1 priority of the government and the Australian community. We have put in place an economic stimulus which is supported by all sides of Australian politics, by the business community and by most of the major economists in the community. It is supported by just about everyone except the Liberal and National parties in this House. Economic stimulus is supported globally by those on the left and the right of politics. All are saying that economic stimulus is the right course of action in these circumstances to protect our community. We put that in place. We put it in place to the point where the economy did not go backwards over the past year. Economic stimulus in this country meant that we grew by 0.6 per cent in the last year. If it had not have been for that economic stimulus, we would have gone backwards by 1.3 per cent.If those opposite had their way, there would be tens of thousands of Australians unemployed and there would be businesses closing their doors. The economic stimulus has meant that customers have been going through the doors of business, that the construction sector and the retail sector have been cushioned from the impact of this global recession and that confidence has become much stronger here than anywhere else in the world. It is true: the stimulus is greater than the sum of its parts. What the stimulus has added up to is confidence in this country - unlike confidence elsewhere in the advanced world. That is one of the reasons that we have produced one of the best results in the advanced world.Those on the other side of the House have been preoccupied with playing politics. They sat in this House at 4 am and 5 am back in February and voted against every element of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. And, in so doing, they demonstrated that they put their jobs before the jobs of Australian families - before the breadwinners in Australian families - and before the national interest of the Australian economy. What we have seen in the question today from the shadow Treasurer is yet another example of the brutal politics being played by those opposite. They want to resurrect another John Howard scare campaign on interest rates and they want to make false connections between the pressures on rates.They know very well that interest rates in this community are at emergency levels. They are at emergency levels because we have had a big problem in the national economy, and they will be adjusted independently by the Reserve Bank as the stimulus unwinds and as they move forward when global growth returns. Those opposite want to somehow say that that will be a product of our stimulus. Well, it is not. This is just another Liberal Party scare campaign - like the scare campaign we had from them many years ago. - We recognise their behaviour. We on this side of the House will not tell lies to the Australian people, like the Liberal and National parties did with the lies that they told about keeping interest rates at record lows. - Mr Speaker, those opposite - Opposition members - Withdraw! - I withdraw. Those opposite made a solemn promise to the Australian people. They put it in a television ad. They said that they would keep interest rates at record lows - and interest rates went up 10 times in a row! - So we recognise a John Howard scare campaign when we see one - and it is coming because they are so embarrassed about their failure to support in this House the economic stimulus which has supported the employment of tens of thousands of Australians and supported tens of thousands of small businesses. - Those opposite should be condemned for their political behaviour and their negative approach. We on this side of the House will always stand up for the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. I know that in his electorate there are many taxi drivers, secretaries and office workers who do not believe in having to pay for the private health insurance -  - of the most wealthy in the community, including members of parliament. We are determined to pursue the changes announced in the May budget. We believe that they are central to protecting the long-term sustainability of the budget. They will help reduce debt and deficit and, importantly, they will free up funding for us to be able to invest in other important health initiatives. We know that, if we do nothing, the current rebate will double as a proportion of health expenditure by 2046. We know that the opposition's blocking of our reform plans will blow not just a $1.9 billion hole in this budget but a $9 billion hole over the next decade. The Leader of the Opposition might be happy to jeopardise our nation's finances in the middle of the global financial crisis, but the government are not prepared to.I thought the House might be interested in a view that was put forward about private health insurance not by the Leader of the Opposition but by another leader in this parliament - that is, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. The Leader of the National Party in the Senate said today, 'Now, with private health insurance we want to make sure we get as many people basically covering their own costs.' What a good idea. That is exactly what this bill is doing. So I would suggest to Mr Joyce, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, that, if he thinks this is such a good idea, perhaps he needs to tell his brothers and sisters in the Liberal Party that they should vote for it; or, better yet, perhaps the National Party should vote for it in the Senate even if the Liberal Party is not prepared to have the guts to pursue this matter.These changes to private health insurance are some of the most structural saves in this year's budget. We believe that it is vital for these changes to be implemented and we are not going to stand by idly and allow the opposition to wipe out those savings. The opportunity lost for us to invest in other important health reforms is just too high. Of course, if it takes a special sitting of the Senate to get the opposition to pass this legislation, the government is prepared to consider that. As I have said, we have taken advice on what steps could be necessary to recall the parliament in December and we are currently considering that advice. But I make quite clear, as I have before, that the government is not looking for a double dissolution trigger; what we are looking for is for this measure to be passed - full stop. The Liberal Party have that in their hands; the National Party have that in their hands; and it is about time they started supporting this measure.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question, as it goes to the direct impact of climate change on local communities - in particular, coastal communities in Australia. I welcome the question, because it is about the reality of climate change, the reality of its impact and what we do about it, and because it is coming from someone who is not a climate change denier, which is what we normally encounter when we receive questions from the opposition. - 'Climate change denier' is writ large across the ranks of those opposite, and the Leader of the National Party knows that full well, not least within his own party and the leader of his party in the Senate. But let us not dwell on that.The honourable member asked a question about what government programs are being deployed to assist coastal communities to engage with the reality of the impact of climate change and coastal inundation - and what can be done about it. Through the Caring for our Country program we have at present a range of initiatives aimed at assisting local communities with dune erosion projects that focus on managing and improving habitats and biodiversity of coastal ecosystems. That is one thing that is embraced by the government. Another - for the benefit of the honourable member - is an initiative which we as a government initiated, called Caring for our Coasts, some $25 million.An opposition member - Is that all? - The honourable member interjects: 'Is that all?' That is $25 million more, as I am advised, than existed previously. - I look forward to the Leader of the National Party standing at the dispatch box today and telling us all that the National Party has done on climate change. I am sure it will be a short presentation indeed on the part of the Leader of the National Party, given that his party in the Senate routinely seeks to torpedo any initiative of the parliament that deals with the reality of the impact of climate change.An opposition member - What about reality? - 'Reality?' That is a challenge from over there as to whether climate change is real as well. I said before that they are full of climate change deniers; they continue to rise to the occasion and to rise to the challenge. Under this $25 million Caring for our Coast initiative, the Department of Climate Change is leading a national assessment of Australia's coastal zone vulnerability to climate change impacts, to be completed late in 2009. - Mr Speaker, was that the member for Tangney who was interjecting?Government members - Yes! - He of the shadecloths in space? When we look for concrete and positive contributions to the climate change debate, we have one of the more progressive forces of the coalition out there advocating that the way for Australia to deal with climate change is to erect a shadecloth in space. That is matched only by the member for McEwen's recommendation that we put one across the Great Barrier Reef. In fact it is a shadecloth ribbon -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As the member for Menzies would know, I have been responding to the climate change scepticism within interjections from members of his party and from members of the National Party during my answer. If he is interested in climate change, perhaps he could contribute to bringing about a unified position on climate change within the Liberal Party and between the Liberal Party and the National Party. - There is nothing like climate change to get the coalition going. The member for Lyne, led by the most progressive forces embodied in the member for Menzies, whom I have always seen as being strong on this issue as well as so many other reforms before the parliament, asks in particular about other programs which are available for deployment by local communities. Out of the Caring for our Coasts initiative of some $25 million, national assessments of the vulnerability of Australia's coastal zone to climate change impacts is to be completed by late 2009. As part of this assessment the government in August launched a National Coastal Landform and Stability Mapping Tool. The purpose of that is to benefit local planners and decision makers as they make coastal planning decisions into the future. That is to deal with prospective challenges. A legitimate question being put by local governments across the country is what information base they are to depend on in the future in making local planning decisions. This would represent one such possible tool, and that is what is available.Furthermore, I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact - and I am sure that he is aware of this already but other members of the House may not be - that the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, the Environment and the Arts, chaired I believe by the member for Throsby, is currently engaged in an inquiry into climate change related environmental impacts on coastal communities. Submissions were received up until 30 May and the last of public hearings was held on 27 August. It will be important to see what conclusions that committee reaches in its deliberations on this important question as well. I am also advised that one of the honourable member's constituents, Mr Keys, made a presentation to that inquiry in March. He is a resident of one of the communities that he referred to at Old Bar. This is a very practical and personal concern. My understanding is that Mr Keys has already lost residences to coastal inundation on that part of the New South Wales coast. - I am not quite certain what the member for Riverina was saying about the impact of coastal erosion forces in her own electorate. I understand she would like people to move to her electorate from where they have gone. Therefore, in summary, in answer to the honourable member's question, there are two specific programs that the government has embraced on this. I suggest that the honourable member, in close consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and other relevant government ministers, seeks to cooperate with those programs in terms of a proper analysis of the impacts in his area. We look forward, as I said before, to the findings of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, which is specifically dealing with an inquiry into the impact of climate change on coastal communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question. The government is committed to returning the budget to surplus as quickly as possible in the wake of the damage done by the global financial crisis. As part of that strategy, the government has put in place $22 billion worth of savings in this year's budget. A number of these savings are substantial structural savings that are designed to increase the returns to the budget over time. Unfortunately, last week one of the key structural savings in this year's budget was defeated in the Senate. I refer, of course, to the reforms to the private health insurance rebate, which would have delivered a reduction of $1.9 billion in government spending over the course of the next four years. We may well ask who it was that defeated this initiative in the Senate and what their position is on the state of the nation's budget. It was, of course, the opposition - the Liberal and National parties - that defeated the initiative in the Senate, the same opposition that say that the projected deficits are too high and that, were they in government, they would be cutting back dramatically on government spending.At no point over the past couple of years have we heard a single substantial spending cut proposed by the opposition - the same opposition that says it stands for lower tax and lower spending. The opposition's one significant intervention in the debate about the structure of the budget has been to knock off this very substantial reduction in government spending and, in order to cover the loss of money involved, it proposes a tax increase. That was the proposition put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. The party that accuses the government of being the tax-and-spend party is in fact the only party that has put forward a proposal to both increase the total spending in the budget and increase taxation.I notice that another minor obstacle to the budget returning to surplus emerged last week. According to the ASIC website, Henry Ergas's Concept Economics, which is the preferred economic adviser of the opposition and designer of its secret tax plan, has gone into administration. The opposition's brains trust has gone broke. Maybe Malcolm has not paid the bill or something. I am not quite sure what the opposition are now going to do given that their only source of serious analysis of economic and fiscal and taxation issues is no longer in the field. They may have to do some thinking for themselves. Perish the thought! There is a crunch coming for the opposition here, because the moment arrives in this game when you are in opposition when you have to set down in detail precisely what changes you would make to the budget settings, what promises you would make to increase spending and for which programs, what spending cuts you would make and what tax changes you would make. And guess what: they all get aggregated, they get added up, and people are able to see whether or not you live up to your commitments to drastically slash government spending, to drastically reduce the deficit and to drastically reduce government debt. I will wait with great interest for that moment, because I suspect that what we will find out then is that all of this carry-on about debt and deficit is just empty rhetoric.</DOC>

 - As the Leader of the Opposition would well know, when the government announced plans for a national broadband network we said at that stage that we would also welcome co-investment by the private sector. That is the first point to make; and, secondly, therefore the proposition which underpins his question is largely undermined. Can I also say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that the reason the government took the extraordinary step of saying that we would build a national broadband network is that we saw 12 years of conspicuous failure on broadband on the part of those opposite.The reason we have embarked upon this reform is that what we see in the most recent OECD report is that, firstly, Australia is in the bottom half of the OECD for broadband take-up. Secondly, the monthly broadband subscription price for medium-speed connections is US$56. That is the fifth most expensive in the OECD. Thirdly, Australia's broadband speed lags behind 26 other OECD countries, including the Slovak Republic. The government is acting because the previous government engaged in an absolute neglect of this country's critical infrastructure for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Last night President Obama spoke in New York on the first anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. That day in some respects, as we know, marked the onset of the global financial crisis, the global economic crisis and, of course, the global employment crisis - and the worst global recession that we have seen since the Great Depression three-quarters of a century ago. The President's speech looked back to the dark days of September last year when the global financial system teetered on the brink of collapse and when the global economy stared into the abyss. -  - I find it remarkable that those opposite regard the events of the last 12 months and the gravity of the global financial crisis, which has torpedoed the superannuation earnings of so many Australians, as something worthy of amusement. The President also looked forward to the challenges ahead. He spoke of the fundamental challenge of reshaping the global financial regulatory system to prevent history from simply repeating itself. He went on to say, and this is in the President's own words:We will not go back to the days of reckless behavior and unchecked excess that was at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses.Those are the words of the President. Through American leadership the G20 has been working since its first meeting in Washington at the end of last year on this important reform project. At the London summit the governments of the G20 committed themselves to a global action plan on financial regulation covering capital adequacy regimes, the regulation of systemically significant institutions, the regulation of credit-rating agencies, the regulation of short selling, the reform of the derivatives, cross-border supervisory colleges and the regulation of executive remuneration. That work will continue when the G20 summit again convenes in Pittsburgh next week.Australia's financial system has been resilient through the crisis. This has been aided by the government's sovereign guarantee to all Australian deposit holders, for the first time in Australian history, to underpin the stability of our financial system - and also underpinned by the government's guarantee of wholesale term funding, again for the first time in Australia's history. Of the 100 largest banks in the world only nine remain AA rated or above today. Four of these banks are Australian. But we cannot rest on our laurels, because the Australian financial sector is in fact deeply integrated with global markets and therefore must be part of the global reform effort.Today, and I assume honourable members opposite will join me in this as well, we pay tribute to the work of the Australian Treasury, the RBA, APRA and ASIC - because through these institutions Australia is participating in the most ambitious overhaul of the global financial regulatory architecture since the end of the Second World War. But there is much, much more work to be done through the agency of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board. Through the FSB Australia's voice is now stronger than before. Australia's representation on the FSB has now been increased from one to two members and includes both the RBA and the Treasury. Through APRA we have also now, for the first time, secured a position on the 12-member Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Furthermore the FSB's membership has now been virtually standardised to that of the G20.Finally, overnight the President commended the role of the G20 in responding to the global financial and economic crisis. He said the G20:_ has proven to be an effective forum for coordinating policies among key developed and emerging economies _Importantly, the President of the United States also noted for the first time that the G20 was an institution, and I quote him:_ that I see taking on an important role in the future.As the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, has already observed in this place, there are many in the world who would not necessarily argue for a robust future for the G20. The G20's future as a key part of the architecture of global governance is by no means a done deal.

 - I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that if he reflected for one moment on the conspicuous failure of the previous government to build a national broadband network he would begin to understand the deficiency and the gap into which the current government seeks to move. Secondly, an expert advisory panel, including the Treasury, upon reflection of the responses to the initial tender round for expressions of interest from the communications industry, advised the government through the Treasury that this represented the absolute best value for taxpayers' money which existed. In other words, to embark upon another course of action was not desirable in bringing about this infrastructure which is necessary for the future of the Australian economy. It is good for business, good for productivity, good for the delivery of e-health, good for e-education and good for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question, because it is a year ago today that the US's fourth largest investment bank, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy. Of course, that collapse heralded the deepest global recession we have seen in three-quarters of a century. Confidence was shattered, global financial markets went into meltdown and the global economy went into freefall. Something like 29 of the world's 33 advanced economies fell into recession, something like 12 million jobs were lost across advanced economies and something like $30 trillion was wiped from global stock markets. So this was 12 months that shook the world.I think that Australians are entitled to be proud of the way in which they have all pulled together in the midst of this global recession. It has been the combination of economic stimulus, lower interest rates and community effort that has meant that Australia has performed so well. We are one of only a handful of advanced economies that have so far avoided recession and we are the only advanced economy to have recorded positive growth over the past year.Last night President Obama made some statements on the crisis, as the Prime Minister was saying before. He made the point that, whilst there were some signs of returning to normal, this should not lead to complacency. We certainly agree with President Obama that the job is far from finished. In this country, like in the United States, we have those who wish to ignore the events of the past year. This is what President Obama said overnight:There will be those who argue we should do less or nothing at all. There will be those who engage in revisionist history or have selective memories and don't seem to recall what we just went through last year.Who does that remind us of? It is those opposite. They denied the existence of the global recession. They would have sat and waited and done absolutely nothing. Because they do not understand the nature of the global financial crisis, they are not qualified to deal with the challenges that flow from it. They have demonstrated that day in and day out in this parliament.The biggest challenge that we face is employment. Unemployment and underemployment are still very substantial challenges for this country. Unemployment has increased by the equivalent of 200,000 jobs in the past year. There has been a huge reduction in hours worked. The reduction in working hours across the economy is equivalent to the loss of more than 200,000 full-time jobs. That is why we as a country need to support our economy. We need to back in the essential economic stimulus to support Australians in work, to keep customers coming through the door and to support business.So on this side of the House employment is our No. 1 priority, but it is not the No. 1 priority of those opposite. They have dismissed it as a second order priority. Support for stimulus comes from right around the country, from the business community, from the wider community but not from those opposite. It has been one monumental misjudgment by those opposite from day one. They are not qualified to understand the nature of the global recession and they are not qualified to understand what must be done to strengthen our economy into the future.</DOC>

 - I am always taken by these questions asked by the opposition about broadband, given that they seem to be so spectacularly anchored in the past when this government is seeking to invest in the nation's future. Can I say to the honourable gentleman opposite that, when you are about to embark upon the single largest infrastructure project in Australia's history, you plan it thoroughly and you work with your private sector partners, or prospective private sector partners, in that project. On top of that, you also get your regulatory regime right.I would draw the honourable member's attention to what he conspicuously does not ask about today, which is the fundamental reform of telecommunications in this country, as indicated by the release of the telecommunications legislation amendment bill 2009. If the honourable member suggests that it is possible to unfold every aspect of the details of this proposed infrastructure investment for the future in the absence of the regulatory reforms necessary, which involve those which go to the heart of Telstra's current near monopoly, then he demonstrates how out of touch and ignorant he is of these matters.We have taken this decision based on the absolute best of Treasury advice. We will proceed with the implementation of this critical missing link in Australia's productivity for the future. It is the right infrastructure for the future. We will proceed methodically, carefully, consistently through the implementation of this to deal with the conspicuous gap in infrastructure which those opposite left behind for 12 long years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question and, indeed, her appreciation of the importance of broadband. She, like other Tasmanian members, knows that our National Broadband Network is the single largest nation-building investment in Australia's history. It will first be rolled out in Tasmania. It will drive future growth, productivity and innovation across all sectors of the economy. While the NBN is progressively rolled out around the country, the efficiency of the existing telecommunications regulatory regime remains critical to the delivery of affordable, high-quality services to businesses and to consumers. Minister Conroy has today announced historic reforms to modernise telecommunications regulations in the interests of all Australians. Today the government is delivering fundamental microeconomic reform of telecommunications in the long-term national interest.The first element of the reform program focuses on the current structure of the telecommunications sector. The government will require the functional separation of Telstra, unless it decides to voluntarily structurally separate. The government has been clear about its desire for Telstra to structurally separate on a voluntary and cooperative basis. Today's reforms give Telstra the flexibility to choose its future path. The government has commenced constructive discussions with Telstra on how NBN Co. and Telstra could work collaboratively towards the NBN. The government is also introducing measures to address Telstra's horizontal integration across the copper, cable and mobile platforms. The government will prevent Telstra from acquiring additional spectrum for advanced mobile services unless it structurally separates and divests its HFC cable network and its interest in Foxtel. The legislation provides scope to remove either or both of the cable network and Foxtel requirements if Telstra submits an acceptable undertaking to structurally separate.The second element of the reform package seeks to streamline and simplify the competition regime to provide more certainty and faster outcomes for telecommunications companies. Since the commencement of the regime in 1997 there have been more than 150 telecommunications access disputes, compared to only three access disputes in other regulated sectors, including aviation and energy. This is unacceptable. The government will reform part XIB and part XIC of the Trade Practices Act to simplify the access regime and to deliver greater regulatory certainty. It will also enable the ACCC to act quickly on anticompetitive conduct.The third element of the reform package will strengthen consumer safeguards to ensure services standards are maintained at a high level. The final element of the package seeks to remove inefficient and redundant red tape and to address impediments to Australia's long-term productivity growth. These historic fundamental reforms address longstanding inadequacies of the existing telecommunications regulatory regime. They are within the national interest and they are consistent with our approach to drive future growth, productivity and innovation across all sectors of the economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. I know that, with her long and strong history in defending the rights of working men and women, she knows what an important issue this is. Australians are rightly proud of the progress that we have made over many years in achieving greater equality between men and women. But, while Australians have changed their attitudes and their behaviours over time, it is a little disappointing to see that the opposition in many respects have not. Yesterday we heard from the member for O'Connor, who said that women want to work part time on the weekends so dad can be home to look after the kids. -  - Mr Speaker, I was actually going to agree with the member for O'Connor in one respect, which is that that does suit many families. There are many families where they want to have one person working part time. But there are a lot of families where women want to work full time too. It is a little difficult to be the Governor-General or the CEO of Westpac or the CEO of Heytesbury Holdings and work part time. In fact, there are women all over Australia who are supporting themselves and supporting their kids, struggling along with full-time work - and they are proud to do it.The fact is that the modern world has both men and women working and it has both men and women wanting to share the responsibility and the joy of raising kids and looking after a family. Our modern workplace laws have to reflect that. They have to reflect the modern reality that women work part time and full time. Dads tell me all the time that they want to spend more time with their kids. The fact that some women want to work part time so dad can be home with the kids on the weekend certainly is not a reason to exploit them. It is certainly not a reason to pay them less or take away their pay and conditions. It reflects a very old fashioned view that women are not supporting a family when they work; they are working for pin money.Last week we saw the gratuitous insults about women in our defence forces. We heard opposition members say that women on the front line would threaten rational thought and the success of the mission and that the psychological standards of the forces would be compromised by the admission of women. Well, news flash: women are already soldiers, sailors, pilots and medics. They are already on the front line.We see an emerging trend here - an emerging trend of an opposition stuck in the past and out of touch with the reality of modern Australian lives. And nowhere is this more evident than on the website of the Liberal Party of Australia. I had a look at the website of the Liberal Party of Australia and it has a section about the Liberal Party. In the section about the Liberal Party it has a subheading 'Women and the Liberal Party'. It is good. It is very interesting and very informative. I looked at the picture in the 'Women and the Liberal Party' section and found that it has one, two -  - Actually, Julie, you are in it; it is okay. - The photograph has four blokes and one woman. But it actually gets even better. It says that the 'government recognises that the ability of women to participate in the workforce, and in society more broadly, is underpinned by education and training'. It goes on to say that the 'government is committed to an Australia where women are full and active participants', and 'the government has introduced a number of measures to allow women to better prepare for their retirement'. Oops! It has been almost two years now -  - It has been almost two years. John Howard is not the Prime Minister anymore. Sir Robert Menzies is not the Prime Minister anymore. Both men and women work outside the home and inside the home. The majority of families share work and caring responsibilities, and at different times in their lives together mum may stay home more with their kids. At different times there are -  -  - At different times in their lives together, mum and dad share those caring responsibilities. Sometimes mum stays at home more -  - sometimes grandparents help out - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for her question and I know that she is dedicated to fairness and decency at work. I know that she, like members of the government generally, would frequently discuss with their constituents the challenges of balancing work and family life - the challenges of families making choices. In order to be able to make those choices, women in particular rely on a fair and decent workplace relations system.We know when we look at working women that one in five is reliant on awards. That is, they are reliant for their terms and conditions at work on a safety net - a safety net that cannot be stripped away, a safety net that gives them rights in their workplace. We know that almost half of Australian women with children under five are in paid work. We know, too, that 86 per cent of single-parent families are headed by women and that, at the appropriate stage of life, many of these women seek to balance work and family life as they take care of their children.Understanding this about our modern economy and our modern society, the Howard government - the Liberal Party, aided by the National Party - introduced Work Choices so that it could strip away basic protections. We know from the statistics that, under Work Choices, it was women who bore the brunt of these harsh and unjust laws. We know that it was women who bore the brunt of what happened under Work Choices. If we look at what happened under Australian workplace agreements - statutory individual employment agreements - ABS data tells us that working women on AWAs earned less than working women on collective agreements. The take-home pay of women working full-time on AWAs was, on average, $87.40 per week less than their female colleagues working on collective agreements. That is a staggering figure. We know that women working on AWAs in casual jobs earned $94 per week less than women on collective agreements. Once again this is a staggering figure about what Work Choices did to working women.It is because Labor understood the deep unfairness of Work Choices to working Australians, and to working women in particular, that we killed Work Choices and replaced it with a fair and decent system at work. But, on the weekend, the opposition leader let the cat out of the bag. When challenged about whether or not he would reintroduce this kind of unfairness in our workplace, he refused to rule it out. Of course, he refused to rule it out because the Liberal Party is now and always will be the party of Work Choices. We have seen some remarkable conduct on display in question time today. We know that the Liberal Party does not like women asking questions, we know that they do not want to listen to the Minister for the Status of Women when she is answering questions, and we know that they are in the embrace of deep unfairness about women at work. We also know that, if they ever had the opportunity, they would bring Work Choices back - with all of the consequences that it would have for Australian working women.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her question. I note the fact that in this parliament she voted against the 116 schools in her electorate benefiting from 265 projects - total funding, in her electorate, of $128 million. She voted against every dollar of it, and she voted against every job that it would have supported. She is nodding her head in agreement: yes, she did vote against every dollar of it and, yes, she did vote against every job that it would have supported.On the figures she has raised about one of the schools benefiting under Building the Education Revolution, I am happy to look at what the member for Farrer said, but I would issue these words of caution: when matters have been raised by the opposition in the past, we have frequently found that things asserted as facts are nowhere near facts. We have also frequently found, when we have tried to follow matters up with members of the opposition - or at least some of them - that they are more interested in making a political point than they are in getting matters resolved for their local schools. But you would expect that attitude to be on display by members of a political party that voted against the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's -  - Can I say about the Building the Education Revolution program that the one thing we absolutely know is that P&amp;Cs around the country support the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. The political party in this parliament that stands on the sides of parents and citizens who support schools is the government. - As I was saying, the political party in this parliament that is representing the views of parents who care about schools is the government. The political party that has set its face against the views of parents is that which voted against the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. My reference to inaccuracies was a reference to members of the opposition who have come in this parliament from time to time and raised wholly inaccurate matters about Building the Education Revolution, and we have got very clear evidence of that. Can I say to the member for Farrer, who represents a -  - I am prepared to say that it may just be plain stupidity that leads them to make these false assertions. But, on the views of those that care about education -  - The member for Solomon then left the Chamber. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question and particularly for her advocacy on behalf of around 24,000 pensioners in the seat of Robertson. It is the case that, from this Sunday, millions of Australian women will benefit from the government's reforms to the pension system. It is the case that women disproportionately rely on the pension for their survival. It is the case that 57 per cent of age pensioners are women and, more important for all of us to be aware of, three out of four Australian single age pensioners are women. They in particular will benefit from the major reforms that the government is introducing, which start this Sunday.It is the case that these single pensioners, many, many of them women, will benefit from the increase to the single age pension, which starts on Sunday. The increase, if you are on the maximum rate, will be $70.83 per fortnight - $70.83 per fortnight for those single age pensioners relying on the maximum rate of the pension. Of course, this increase comes about because of the significant increase in the base pension that was announced in the budget, the increase in the new pension supplement and the increase that is due to the new pension index that this government has introduced.It is also the case, of course, that women represent more than two-thirds of all people who are on the carer payment. Those women in particular have already benefited from the new carer supplement, which this government introduced and made permanent for the first time - not like the previous government, who of course made these decisions for both older Australians and carers when it suited them politically. There was almost a decade of neglect from those opposite as far as pensioners were concerned. The pension was not enough for millions of Australian women dependent on it. Millions of Australian women could not survive on the pension. And for the whole time that those opposite were in government they were not capable of delivering to Australian pensioners. They did not have the bottle to deliver the reforms that we have delivered in the short time that we have been in office.It is not just reforms to the pension that those opposite were not prepared to tackle. Take another very important matter of support for families, which is paid parental leave. Listen to what the current shadow minister for families had to say about paid maternity leave back in 2002. It will not be a surprise to some people that when he was a minister in the Howard government this is what the current member for Warringah said:_ paid maternity leave, over this Government's dead body , frankly. It just won't happen under this Government.Well, Tony, you were spot-on about that. - It certainly did not happen under a Liberal government. Now that that government is dead, fortunately this government can get on with the job of introducing paid parental leave. We will be able to do so without any help whatsoever from the lifeless form over there that calls itself an opposition. We know how stuck in the past it is, but I must say that, even knowing how stuck in the past it is, I was very surprised to read in the Age today of the attitudes - and I am sure even the current member for Higgins was surprised to read this - of some preselectors in the electorate of Higgins. It was reported in the Age today that Higgins is:_ 'not a seat for a woman because it's a leadership seat' _It is not a seat for women, according to the preselectors in Higgins. Apparently some of these Liberal preselectors -  - Unfortunately, the final quote from the preselectors for Higgins actually raised questions about whether or not the candidate's marriage would even survive if she won a federal seat. This just demonstrates yet again how stuck in the past the Liberal Party is.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. This year I was exposed on television as not smarter than a fifth grader, it is true, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is taking me back to when I was not even in fifth grade. And, no, I have to confess that when I was in Mitcham Primary School they were not playing maiden speeches, first speeches, in the House of Representatives. Actually, looking back on it, I am not sure that we had a TV in the classroom. I think we had a radio, but we did not have a TV, so long ago it is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is referring to. - I believe that statement was made in 1969. Apparently they have gone this strange because I used the word 'Menzies' when I was reading the letter from the principal. Can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, whether or not they realise it over there, life has moved on. Mr Keating has moved on and has made public statements to that effect. The nation has moved on. Policy has moved on. The only people who, for almost 40 years now have obviously been out circling in the wilderness, are not understanding that things have moved on are those people in front of me - the members of the Liberal Party. This question is reminiscent of the old sitcoms we used to see about fighters from World War II who did not realise that the war was over.Leave not granted. - We do have the Hansard, so the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not need to table the extract from it. Can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that while she and the Liberal Party might be stuck thinking about 1969 we as a government are dealing with the challenges of the modern age. The problem for the Liberal Party is that in this modern age, a modern age where people believe that women are equal and extend them the same opportunities, the Liberal Party is stuck in the past. Its website was stuck in the past until raised in question time. Of course you can change a website; what you cannot change is the dinosaur attitudes we are seeing displayed by the Liberal Party today.They are stuck in the past, unable to move into the future and unable to embrace the future. They are stuck in the past on the role of women, stuck in the past on the question of climate change and stuck in the past in the embrace of Work Choices. This has been an embarrassment for the Liberal Party. I woke up this morning, read the newspaper and thought that it was pretty bad that the Liberal Party did not give a fair share of questions to women. Now I have come to question time and watched them gag women speaking. However, having seen this performance from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, maybe the deputy leader is better off without questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, because I too read the remarks of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve overnight. I took some encouragement from his remarks, but he made one fundamental point that the Leader of the Opposition neglected to mention. Very simply, that point is that the growth outlook is weak. He was making the point that the US might be seeing their first positive quarter of growth in some time. He was actually pointing to a ray of light in the United States economy, but he then said that there was a long, long way to go. He was not saying to the United States government or to the United States President that, as a consequence of the fact that they might grow in one quarter, they should withdraw their stimulus. He was not saying that at all, because in the United States, as is the case in this country, fiscal stimulus has been absolutely critical to supporting jobs, growth and confidence in the economy.We had a growth figure of 0.6 per cent for the June quarter and of 0.6 per cent for the year. But, if those opposite had had their way, we would have gone backwards in the past year by 1.3 per cent. The truth is that most acknowledge - including the business community and most economists - that the very substantial fiscal stimulus put in place by this government has supported our economy, supported tens of thousands of jobs and kept open tens of thousands of small businesses. The Leader of the Opposition is seeking to construct the argument that somehow now is the time to rip the rug out from underneath the economy. He will not find any encouragement for that in the words of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Our stimulus has ensured that we have remained positive while the rest of the world has gone backwards. When you look at the evaluation of the Australian stimulus compared to stimuluses put in place by many other countries around the world, ours generally gets the big tick. It gets the big tick because it has been one of the most effective in the world and it is the reason we were the only advanced economy in the world to grow over the past year.Those opposite simply do not understand the nature of the global economic challenge and its impact upon this country and, as a consequence, are not qualified to understand what policies are required as we move through to recovery. This government absolutely understand the importance of stimulus and the importance of the monetary policy put in place by the Reserve Bank. We understand both of those things and, as a consequence of that, we have been the best-performing major advanced economy in the world, which is something those opposite are completely incapable of understanding. Our stimulus has kept customers coming through the doors of not just retail businesses but also other businesses across the country. Our investment allowance provided a dramatic boost to many companies when they were purchasing equipment. All of these things are recognised in the figures which come from the ABS on a regular basis. They are in the retail sales. They are in the equipment measures. They are there for all to see. But those opposite are so blinded by their ideology and so driven by their own personal self-interest that they cannot see what is in the national economic interest. We on this side of the House can. We are implementing a stimulus which is supporting Australian business and Australian jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Amid continuing talk about green shoots in the international economy, there does remain widespread and legitimate caution over the world's ability to quickly respond to the damage which has been inflicted upon it over the last 12 months through the global financial crisis and the ensuing global economic recession. As a nation, Australia should be proud of our collective response to the global recession thus far. We are doing better than most other countries in the world. But as a nation we should also be very much aware of the fact that we are by no means out of the woods yet.I draw the House's attention, on a sobering note, to comments which were reported, I believe, in either today's or yesterday's Financial Times by William White, who is the former chief of the economics group of the Bank for International Settlements. It may be recalled by some members of this place that the BIS actually produced a report some time towards the middle of 2008 which warned the global economy about the grave risks which had been building up from 2003 concerning global imbalances. That was a warning delivered to the world well prior to the subprime implosion which then wrought havoc upon the financial system and the real economy.This former chief of the economics group BIS indicated in his statements of just a day or two ago that we should still have concerns about the possibility of a double-dip recession - and this individual made the comments recently - therefore, it is important that we adopt a sober approach to the data which is emerging worldwide. Yesterday the RBA board minutes noted that the global economy remains fragile. They pointed to a continued consolidation in the global economy. They also noted there were concerns about the sustainability of the recovery. They questioned whether the growth that had been seen was largely a one-off effect from stimulus measures or if there was also a fundamental improvement. This reinforces the IMF statement last week that the global financial system was 'far from returning to normal' and that many markets remain highly dependent on public support. Furthermore, the minutes reinforce a statement made recently by the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner: 'We still have a long way to go before a true recovery takes hold.'There is no doubt that the government's economic stimulus strategy here in Australia has supported the Australian economy. Yesterday's minutes of the board of the RBA recognise the positive impact of the stimulus, particularly on business investment, something to which the Treasurer just referred. The minutes stated:The data for business investment in the June quarter indicated a strong rise in spending on plant and equipment, with a sharp increase in spending on a wide range of capital goods, including cars.This mostly reflects the bringing forward of spending to qualify for tax allowances. This also follows endorsements earlier on by the Governor of the RBA in testimony to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, where he stated:_ I think an objective observer would say that the size and speed of that response has been one of the important factors in supporting private demand over the past nine months.Treasury has provided analysis about the impact of the fiscal stimulus in its own right on the overall economy. It has advised that the economy would have contracted by 1.3 per cent over the past 12 months in the absence of stimulus. Instead, as noted just now by the Treasurer, the economy has grown by 0.6 per cent. The stimulus has been essential therefore to supporting jobs. The Treasury is advised that it will support 200,000-plus jobs in each of the next two years.I think it is worth the House reflecting for a moment on what would happen in Australia if we were currently running the unemployment rates that we have seen elsewhere in the developed world. For example, if we were running the unemployment levels which currently apply in Europe and the United States, there would be 422,000 more Australians out of work, which would mean a million unemployed. - It is good to see the Manager of Opposition Business responding so forcefully to the representations made in his joint party room yesterday.The government's fiscal stimulus is designed to phase down as the economy strengthens. The Treasury advises that the impact of the stimulus on growth was, in fact, at its peak in the June quarter of this year and that its impact on growth will diminish over coming quarters. As I said yesterday to the House, the stimulus has its maximum effect of 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2008-9, 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2009-10, 1.4 per cent of GDP in 2010-11 and 0.2 percent in 2011-12.I just draw the House's attention again to a statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, which goes to the impact of both monetary policy and fiscal policy over time in responding to the crisis and the gradual emergence of any signs of recovery in the economy. On stimulus, he said:_ provided it is temporary support while the private sector sorts itself out, and then the government gradually reverses that over time and things go back to roughly where they were - that will be a good outcome, if that is where we end up. It is just like interest rates: abruptly adjust, and then gradually normalise things as the economy normalises.Just as the government's economic stimulus was designed to be withdrawn as the economy recovers, the Reserve Bank board will make a judgement as to when monetary stimulus can be safely wound back from its current emergency settings.The Governor of the Reserve Bank has said that, as the global economy recovers from recession, interest rates in Australia will rise from emergency levels. That means that fiscal and monetary stimulus will both be being withdrawn as the private sector recovers. This represents, overall, an entirely appropriate conservative approach to economic management, which is: as the private economy is weak, the public economy expands and, through public stimulus, as the private economy recovers, those official supports are withdrawn. This is the right approach for Australia under complex and difficult circumstances in the global economy today.</DOC>

 - The member for North Sydney asked me about the government's preparedness to put in place a fiscal strategy that deals with the challenges of the future. Indeed, we announced our medium-term fiscal strategy in the budget this year, and it takes into account fully the fact that at the moment we have weak growth globally and weak growth domestically. But, as the Prime Minister was saying before, as growth gradually returns and as the private sector demand comes back, the stimulus is gradually withdrawn and, of course, the Reserve Bank from time to time will make adjustments to interest rates - which are at 50-year emergency lows - because fiscal policy and monetary policy should work together when an economy grows. Of course, the logical proposition that those opposite are putting forward here is that in this country at the moment we should pull the rug out from under the recovery by getting rid of stimulus.They want to walk into this House and pretend that there is some element of fiscal responsibility in their approach when, only a few days ago in the Senate, they knocked off a savings measure worth $9½ billion over 10 years: the means testing of the private health insurance rebate. That measure is an essential part of the medium-term fiscal strategy that we put in place in the budget, particularly in the context of the need to make savings for the long term, given the ageing of the population and the fact that we had to put in place justice in the pension system by giving a $30 increase in the base rate of pensions. What we demonstrated there was long-term fiscal responsibility - of the type, I assume, the opposition should be thinking of. But, the problem is, they are not. Over there they are a complete rabble. They are incapable of putting together an alternative fiscal policy. They are incapable of fronting up to their responsibilities in the Senate, where they should be passing long-term fiscal sustainability measures that we have put in place to make sure the budget is in good shape to cope with the ageing of our population as we go through the next 40 or 50 years.The government are very serious about our medium-term fiscal strategy, very serious about applying our two per cent expenditure cap when growth returns to above trend, and very serious about doing all of those things that we outlined in the budget to make sure this country is in great shape for the future for our children and our grandchildren. But we understand the responsibilities of the here and now. The responsibilities of the here and now are that the economy requires substantial stimulus to support demand to keep the doors open in retail, to keep the construction sector going, and to give confidence a boost, given how weak the rest of the world is.The end result of the resilience of the Australian economy, of our economic stimulus and of the lowest rates in 50 years in terms of interest rates and the confidence of the Australian people is the strongest growing advanced economy in the global economy. Those opposite should be celebrating that fact and celebrating the fact that Australians have come together to face down this global recession and produce some extraordinary results. But of course they are not capable of that. All they want to do is play a petty political game. They are not capable of supporting measures in the national interest, and for that they should be condemned.</DOC>

 - I would like to make special mention of, and thank, the member for Blair for his question, because we have had several conversations about the National Broadband Network and the importance of efficient telecommunications in his own electorate. The announcement yesterday that the government will require Telstra to structurally separate, together with the reforms announced to the telecommunications regulatory regime, will promote competition and provide better outcomes for consumers. Stronger competition in the telecommunications sector will help put downward pressure on prices, benefiting businesses and consumers right around the country.Stronger competition will also lead to better telecommunications services and will help promote innovation in the sector. These are fundamental microeconomic reforms. They will finally deal with the longstanding shortcomings of the telecommunications regulatory regime. Telstra is one of the most highly integrated telecommunications companies in the world, and that means that Telstra has been able to maintain its dominant position in most areas of the telecommunications market. A more effective regulatory regime will help ensure competitors have fair access to Telstra's network and will help prevent anticompetitive conduct. The anticompetitive conduct and access regimes in the Trade Practices Act have been widely criticised as being cumbersome and not providing sufficient certainty for investment. The government will reform the Trade Practices Act to simplify the access regime and ensure greater certainty.These reforms are integral to the government's plan to roll out the National Broadband Network, which will be an enormously powerful enabling technology for small business in particular. To take one example, the superfast National Broadband Network will enable small businesses to undertake high-quality videoconferencing facilities, and that will extend their market reach and save time and travel costs.Through our nation-building infrastructure investment and microeconomic reform program, the Rudd government is supporting jobs and small businesses today by building the productivity-raising infrastructure of tomorrow, and there is nothing more important in infrastructure than the National Broadband Network.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Murray for her question. I can certainly say to the member for Murray that I agree with the statement of one of her local principals, the principal of the Nanneella Estate Primary School, who said, 'We're pleased to have received enough funds to rejuvenate the school and create a modern learning area.' I certainly agree with that statement. - I can certainly indicate to the member for Murray my support for the 200 projects in the 101 schools in her electorate and the investment of $121 million, of course an investment that she voted against. On the specific matters that she has raised in relation to a local school, I am very happy to look at those specific matters.Can I say generally that it has been drawn to my attention that the member for Sturt, the relevant opposition shadow minister, in a media release on 16 June said this:The Opposition has received hundreds of complaints about the mismanagement of the so-called 'Building the Education Revolution' _I also note that in an article in today's Canberra Times, 'hundreds' has been dropped by his office to having received '60 complaints'. - The member for Murray has raised an issue about a local school and I am making this very simple point and it is no more complicated than this: I presume that this matter is one of around 60 complaints the opposition says it has. That is a complaints' record of 0.25 per cent, one-quarter of one per cent, for the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. I will of course investigate the member for Murray's complaint and I will respond to her directly. On the question of Building the Education Revolution, 9,500 schools and more than 24,000 projects: what is clearly lacking amongst the opposition is a sense of perspective.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I know that he is concerned about supporting jobs in his local community during the days of a global recession. Of course, Building the Education Revolution is about urgently supporting jobs, small businesses and tradespeople in every community across the country during the global recession. One reason schools were chosen for this economic stimulus is that they are in every community across the country. So we are not only supporting jobs and tradespeople in the city but also supporting jobs and tradespeople in rural and regional areas. Thousands of people are having work supported to deliver these school upgrades.As I have had cause to say in the House in the past, there are more than 24,000 projects at around 9,500 schools. I would like to take the House to just one and to its support for local jobs. At the Belgian Gardens State School in the member for Herbert's electorate, the $3.2 million that has been received through the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program and the National School Pride Program is supporting local jobs. The builder, Dickinson Constructions Pty Ltd, is hiring a range of subcontractors, providing work to local businesses including: Amalgamated Pest Control; NatSteel, Garbutt; Townsville Concrete; A Gabrielli Construction; Scott Blocks; Corradini Engineering; G James Glass and Aluminium; Colonial Sheetmetal; Best Doors; High Performance Plumbing; K and F O'Donnell Electrical, Castletown; Cleveland Trade Centre; Project Hardware, Galton; Mark Von Senden Plastering; Alec Morrossi; and RST Airconditioning. So jobs are being supported at this local school as the school engages in the biggest school modernisation program this nation has ever seen.Given that in this question time there have been questions about the state of the economy and the need for support for jobs, can I say to members opposite and to all members of the House that what this one example shows is how economic stimulus through the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history is supporting jobs for local people. That is supported on this side of the House. It is to be deeply regretted that those opposite cannot see their way clear to supporting local jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I understand the member for Grey has been interested in and concerned about the future of this Australian technical college. Of course, when the government was elected we were elected with a commitment to deal with the future of each ATC, and there have been different solutions entered into in different parts of the country. -  - My comments go to the question of whether or not it is closing, so that is directly relevant -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked by the member for Grey about the ATC in his electorate. I am responding directly on the ATC in his electorate. His question is asking me, effectively: is that ATC closing and, consequently, is the money being spent on a facility that is closing? I could not be more relevant than (a) to explain whether or not this ATC is closing and (b) to explain what is happening with the Building the Education Revolution money.On the first point, the future of the ATC he directly asked me about, which I was addressing before the point of order stopped me speaking, the future of that ATC is still under discussion and being worked on. A decision to close that ATC finally has not been taken. On the question of the Building the Education Revolution money and how it relates to the ATC I was asked about, it is dealt with under the guidelines in the same way as the way any other proposition about the possibility that a school may amalgamate or close - that is, money is not spent on that school until the question of amalgamation or closure is clear. So the answer to the member's question is that the money is being held; it is not being spent. As the future of the ATC is still being worked through -  - Can I conclude by saying to the member for Grey: obviously, the money will not be spent until the future of the facility to which he refers is clear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her question, because it is indeed vital for our economy that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme be passed this year. It is vital because it is needed to deliver investment certainty to support the economic recovery. It is vital to deliver investment certainty that is needed to support new investment - of course new investment vital for a low pollution economy. And it is vital to support the green jobs of the future.The business community is convinced of this need for certainty. We had the BCA earlier this year say:In the interests of business certainty, the BCA calls on the Senate to pass legislation this year to establish a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme - a complete repudiation of the position of those opposite. There was the statement from the Ai Group:AI Group has consistently called for the legislation to be passed this year. This is critical to establish the degree of certainty business requires in assessing medium and longer-term investment decisions.So two of the major peak business organisations in this country are supporting the passage of this legislation because it is important for certainty, it is important for investment and of course it is important for jobs.We had a report from the Climate Institute out this week which demonstrates the nature of the challenge that the economy is facing. This report ranks Australia's low-carbon competitiveness as 15th out of 19 countries that have been surveyed. So we have a very long way to go. This low ranking reflects the energy-intensive structure of our economy, the predominance of coal-fired electricity generation and our large untapped energy efficiency potential.Of course, Treasury modelling shows that economies that act early to address these challenges will face lower long-term costs. So not just is it important to get going in terms of sustainability; it is important to get going so we can get a lower cost outcome. We on this side of the House understand the importance of this. Those opposite are so out of touch and so out of step they have no idea what to do about this vital piece of legislation so essential for our future economic prosperity. They are simply stuck in the past.There was a good example of how divided they have become in their party room yesterday. It is pretty fair to say that their climate change policy could have been crafted for them by the cast of The Flintstones. You have the member for Goldstein over there: Barney Rubble. You have the Leader of the Opposition over here: Fred Flintstone. You have the brontosaurus up the back, the member for O'Connor, being very difficult. And, of course, you have a few running around the floor playing up. You have Pebbles over there, the member for Sturt; and you have Bamm-Bamm -  - Yes, Mr Speaker, this is a very serious issue which deserves a serious response from those opposite, and there is not one forthcoming. We on this side of the House have put forward a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme; we have had a green paper; we have had a white paper; we have had legislation; we have got the RET through. But what the country needs is certainty. The business community needs certainty to drive investment. It is absolutely critical to recovery and it is absolutely critical to prosperity in this economy for the long term.Earlier today, I think, the former Leader of the Opposition had a few things to say about the need for the Liberal Party to stand for something. Mr Speaker, they should stand for business certainty, they should stand for a low pollution economy, they should stand for investment and they should stand for green jobs. They should do all of those things, but because they are stuck in the past, because they are incapable of taking a decision, because they are a divided rabble in the parliament, the country cannot get the certainty it needs and those opposite are frustrating important legislation that goes to the very core of our future prosperity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question and for his reference to two of the 129 schools in his electorate that have 298 projects under the Building the Education Revolution program at a cost of $146 million. On the issue of the schools that the member specifically raises, I am obviously happy to look at the issue that he raises. On the question, I am very happy to look at the issue -  -  - Can I say to the member who has raised this question that I will investigate two things - one being the issue of contact with my office. But can I say to the member that, during this parliamentary fortnight, the shadow minister for education asserted in here that I had not responded to an email from the member for Bradfield about going to one of his local schools - and of course when we looked at that matter that assertion was completely incorrect. And then on the issue of comparisons about building cost, I will certainly look at that matter too. But I would say to the member who has raised the question that, during the course of this parliamentary fortnight, once again, the shadow minister for education raised the question of per square metre building costs at Berridale in New South Wales - and when we checked, of course, the assertions that he made about those building costs were completely incorrect. Given that track record -  - Can I conclude by saying that, given that track record - one diary matter raised during this parliamentary fortnight which was completely incorrect; one building comparison raised by the shadow minister for education which, on investigation, proved to be completely incorrect - and against that background, I am sure the member will understand why, when matters are raised with me in question time by opposition members, what I say is: I will investigate them. And I will investigate them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question, knowing the great interest he takes in seeing homes in his electorate getting ceiling insulation from the government's Energy Efficient Homes package, which has now provided roof insulation to some 289,000 Australian households and solar hot water for over 70,000 households. Critically, the estimated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector is around 470,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over the next year alone and over half a million tonnes if we include solar hot water. This is the largest ever rollout of energy efficiency to Australian households. It is producing jobs and it is reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well. We have some 7,300 businesses now registered to take part in the insulation program. That translates into thousands more individual installers and thousands of jobs. Let us be very clear: these jobs would not now be underway if the coalition had had their way, because they opposed these measures.We on this side of the House are committed to ensuring that there is value for money for the work that is done. I am aware that there have been reports of some issues with the rollout of the scheme. That is why I want to assure the House that I will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the compliance measures that are in place and I will not hesitate to adjust them, if required, to ensure that each and every installer of insulation around this country provides the best possible service to their customers. We are also committed to ensuring that all issues and complaints, whether from installers or households, are dealt with effectively. Part of this process means ensuring the accuracy of complaints so they can be properly followed up. I can inform the House that we have followed through on some particular issues that were raised by the opposition in question time on 19 August. The member for Hinkler referred to a company called AllSafe Energy Efficient Products, providing, he said, and I quote: _ 14 different examples of fraudulent and misleading practices by unscrupulous operators _He went on to say:There has been no further response to - the installer's - 14 areas of complaint from the department or the minister's office.I can inform the House that there has been further response on the issues raised by the member for Hinkler - a response in fact from the general manager of AllSafe Energy Efficient Products, sent to me on 20 August and titled 'Incorrect statements made by the member for Hinkler in parliament on 19 August 2009'. In this letter the general manager says:We wish to preface that Mr Neville has misrepresented the nature of comments made by AllSafe Energy Efficient Products' Bundaberg franchise.It goes on to say:Our outlet, as a longstanding provider of insulation to the region, recently provided comment to the Bundaberg media regarding what measures consumers could take to ensure they were dealing with a reputable insulation contracting company, and as a result of the media exposure we are advised that on 18 August Mr Neville's office representative _ contacted our Bundaberg office under the guise of requesting advice on how consumers could avoid less reputable insulation contractors.He writes:I am assured that our franchisee in Bundaberg has not lodged 14 complaints regarding other insulation installers. Further to this, I would have thought that Mr Neville or his representative would have acted more responsibly and with a greater sense of fair play than to take information provided in good faith by an unauthorised office junior as the express opinion of AllSafe Energy Efficient Products.Mr Garrett - he says - to be frank, we believe that Mr Neville's comments in parliament were political point-scoring.He goes on to say:If anything, we actually fear that his comments only serve to hamper your intended policy of stimulating the economy and employment.He goes on to say, in fact:I am told by our Bundaberg franchisee that his operation has employed 12 new staff as a direct result of the government's stimulus package.These jobs would not have been available if the coalition had had their way. They have been undermining the most successful rollout of energy efficiency in our history, they are undermining the thousands of jobs that go with a rollout of ceiling insulation and they are now undermining the good reputation of insulation businesses.It is very disappointing, but here is one more example of the opposition's complete failure to support or comprehend the need for us to take action on climate change generally. I note what the Treasurer said when he made his remarks previously about having to stand for something, because there is the title of a song that comes to mind, and that is simply this: You've Gotta Stand for Something or You'll Fall for Anything. You only need to read the reports in the papers today about the party room. I have to say I have some affection for the member for Bradfield's habits and hobbies. I know he enjoys playing guitar. I know he rides a motorbike.The member for Cook then left the chamber. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As they vacate the parliament of Australia, I make the following point. I think I recognise the significance of the member for Bradfield's contributions generally, but you need only to read the reports of the response to the member's speech in the coalition party room rejecting emissions trading which 'triggered loud applause and a cascade of supportive speakers'. I have fronted a few audiences in my time, and it is very rare that you get a standing ovation for going backwards, and that is what the coalition is doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. I think it is a bit unfortunate that he cannot say the words 'social inclusion' without choking, because I would have thought that kind of fair and decent treatment of all Australians ought to be an objective shared by all members of the House. Clearly I am wrong about that.The member for Mitchell raises with me the question of building costs under the Building the Education Revolution program. The member for Mitchell has raised this with me in the past in relation to the Baulkham Hills school in his electorate, which he raised in this parliament. What he raised at that time was an assertion that the school was being asked to accept a new hall rather than an extension to an existing hall. In making that claim in this parliament, the member for Mitchell was wrong. Having investigated the matter, of course the school is not having its hall pulled down. The proposal is to have the existing hall back-converted to provide two classrooms and to have a new hall built. - I was asked about matters relating to building costs under the Building the Education Revolution program. I am simply making it clear to the member for Mitchell - who I assume is interested in schools in his electorate and, consequently, would be interested in the answer - that the assertion that he made in this parliament about Baulkham Hills High School is not correct. The member has come in today and made an assertion about another school in his electorate. I am sure I would be forgiven for making the remark, given that the current average of the member for Mitchell for raising these matters accurately in this parliament is zero. I will look at the matter he has raised with me, test whether or not it is accurate and respond to it - but, of course, the member for Mitchell made an inaccurate statement in this parliament last time he questioned me. I will test whether or not his current claims are accurate. On the basis of his track record, one needs to be very sceptical about the things said by the member for Mitchell in this place.</DOC>

 - Earlier, the Treasurer made the case for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme because of its importance in generating business certainty. The most significant barrier - the barrier to the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in our economy that would follow - is the coalition. The fact of the matter is they are stuck in the past on this important public policy issue. After one year of leadership of the coalition by the member for Wentworth, the coalition still have no policy on this issue. In fact, the sceptics have gained ground and the evidence is that the coalition are splitting on this issue. In fact, the reports following the Nationals conference a couple of weeks ago demonstrate that none other than Senator Barnaby Joyce has assumed a leadership role on climate change policy in the coalition. This is what Senator Joyce had to say in establishing his claim to leadership on this public policy matter:I am not sceptical about climate at all. I walk round in it every day. I breathe it, I know it is there.At least it clarifies something: he does know that climate exists! But that is about as far as you can take it.In recent times the Nationals have split from the Liberals on this issue by dumping any commitment to an emissions trading scheme. It is clearly the position of the Nationals that they are opposed to emissions trading. That is their stated position. Only two months ago the member for Wide Bay, the Leader of the Nationals, stood with the Leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Wentworth, and made a commitment to the government's emissions reductions targets by the year 2020. The Nationals have now also dropped that commitment; they have abandoned that position.And the disunity on that side of politics on this issue is getting worse. Only today the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Minchin, and the member for O'Connor articulated three different and completely contradictory positions on the issue of amendments to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Senator Minchin adopted quite an interesting stance, particularly given his experience as a parliamentarian. Senator Minchin's position is that the government should formulate the amendments for the opposition and the opposition can then consider them. I will tell you what: we will give you an amendment. Just vote for it! Just stand up and vote for it; do the right thing. The Leader of the Opposition has a different position. He articulated what we understood to be the policy of those opposite, and that is that the Liberal Party will formulate its amendments and put them forward. We look forward to that position. I will come back to it. The member for O'Connor had another different position altogether - at the doors, of course. The member for O'Connor indicated that a majority of the coalition party room opposed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, opposed the targets and opposed the emissions trading scheme and that it was all going to get voted down. They are a shambles on this important policy issue - a complete rabble.Then we see the media reports today. The minutes of the coalition party room meeting were published, I think, in the Age today with all the lists of those who stood up and spoke against emissions trading. - They read like the minutes. The member for Menzies, who we understand to be the policy commissar for the Liberal Party, opposes it, we understand. The member for Tangney got up. We know him to be a sceptic. The member for Mackellar had a few things to say. She is not in the chamber at the moment, but she has advanced quite an interesting theory on these matters in the past. Apparently, she believes that the burning of cow dung is the principal contributor to emissions problems in the international economy and that we are to try to provide some kind of oven for those across Asia to address this issue. Their position is a shambles. What needs to happen here is some unity and some ordinary discipline demonstrated by major political parties on that side of parliament over this important issue. They need to sort out their position, articulate a policy, formulate amendments to government legislation, put the amendments forward, sit down with the government and negotiate a stance. Get your act together.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Murray for her question, which I know would have been personally authorised by the member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition. And I know that the question would also have been authorised by the member for North Sydney as a member of the tactics committee. The honourable member referred to -  -  -  - I would have thought it was unremarkable to observe that a question like that would have been asked with the support of the tactics committee of the Liberal Party and the National Party. I am not sure whether it would have necessarily had the support of the member for McMillan or the member for Pearce or the member for Kooyong or other members in this place, but there you go.The honourable member asked questions about asylum seekers and referred to some statistics on that question. I would remind the honourable member that in the period of the Howard government there were around 13,663 arrivals in Australia. In the period that this government has been in office - and this is the most recent figure that I have available - as of 30 August, for this year, it is 1,025. Secondly, the honourable member referred to changes in government policy. I presume the honourable member is referring in particular to the report that the government released in July 2008, called 'New directions for detention policy'. Recommendation 12 of the report read as follows:The committee - Referring to the relevant parliamentary committee - recommends that, as a priority, the Australian Government introduce amendments to the Migration Act 1958 to enshrine in legislation the reforms to immigration detention policy announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.The day the report was released, the member for Murray, who was a member of the parliamentary committee, said, 'Labor is very much echoing what we did.' When asked whether she accepts the recommendations, she said, 'I do.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley for his question. The honourable member asks about preparations for the Pittsburgh summit. The Pittsburgh agenda will cover the implementation of government stimulus. It will cover also the question of the implementation of reforms to financial markets. It will also go to the question of the proper resourcing of the IMF and its long-term reform to help underpin long-term stability in global financial markets. It will also deal with, among other things, appropriate exit strategies in the medium term and the stimulus arrangements across the G20 economies. For the Australian economy this will be an important meeting - part of a long-term process of dealing with the global dimensions of what has been a fundamental assault on the global economy.The honourable member also asks about certain statements being attributed to G20 leaders. In this House just now, we have had the opportunity to listen, in the suspension motion, to the Leader of the Opposition providing the parliament with a long lecture on the integrity of public administration, a long lecture on being responsible to the parliament, a long lecture on being accountable to the parliament, and I presume that also means being accountable for the integrity of the statements that you make to this parliament. Earlier in question time today, the member for North Sydney asked a question of the Treasurer and referred to a G20 member, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He said this in his question:I refer the Treasurer to the remarks overnight of someone he keeps referencing - the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown - that his government would 'cut costs, cut inefficiencies, cut unnecessary programs and cut lower priority budgets to wind back the British fiscal stimulus.'The member for North Sydney then went on to ask a question of the Treasurer. There is a problem with this. The British Prime Minister made no such statement. The text of the British Prime Minister's statement, delivered to the Trade Union Congress yesterday - the relevant statement from which I presume the member for North Sydney has built his question - reads as follows:Labour will cut costs, cut inefficiencies, cut unnecessary programmes and cut lower priority budgets.There is no reference to 'to wind back the British fiscal stimulus.' There is no reference to the British fiscal stimulus. -  - Those opposite seem to think it is an unremarkable thing to refer to a statement directly from the British Prime Minister when he said no such thing. Can I say this to the honourable members opposite as they seek to shout and hope that this matter simply disappears: what did the British Prime Minister have to say in this speech about stimulus, Member for North Sydney? The British Prime Minister said the following about stimulus:Just this morning I met with the head of the ILO to discuss the best way of protecting jobs.  In two days time I will be working for British jobs at the EU summit, stressing the need to implement fiscal stimulus packages in full without stopping them prematurely.There is one reference to the word 'stimulus', I am advised, in this entire speech by the British Prime Minister. What we have from the member for North Sydney is a deliberate misrepresentation of the statement by the British Prime Minister in order to underpin a political attack here. The member for North Sydney can verbal people and he can infer what they may say according to his own view; he cannot purport in this place to directly quote the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as making a remark which says that they are winding back the British stimulus when the British Prime Minister made no such statement, none whatsoever.We have had example after example of the member for North Sydney being absolutely sloppy with facts, most recently with his extraordinary conspiracy theory about the G20 as a global leftist conspiracy. We have the extraordinary statement he made to the Australian the other day that somehow there would be expenditure cuts of between $40 billion and $50 billion, depending on which version of events you happen to listen to. We have had his extraordinary statement also that jobs should somehow not be the top priority of any democratically elected government in this country. All these things are of one type: they go to misjudgment. This goes to integrity. It goes to the deliberate misrendering of a statement by the British Prime Minister to infer that the British Prime Minister had said that the UK government was winding back its stimulus strategy. It is not in the statement by the British Prime Minister at all. It has been deliberately added by the member for North Sydney in order to make a point. This goes to the heart of this member's integrity. I would ask you now to make proper recourse to the devices of the House to stand at the dispatch box and make a personal explanation as to why this misrepresentation occurred.</DOC>

 - Australia's strong economic performance is the result of the hard work of the Australian people, working with their government in putting in place economic stimulus to support employment, to support business and to support confidence. That is why the OECD has reached the conclusion that it has reached today - that Australia's strong performance amongst OECD countries, advanced economies, is because the government, working with the Australian people, put in place a timely and powerful economic stimulus to support employment, to support business and to support confidence more broadly in the economy.It is the case that there are also a variety of factors. There is no doubt about that - no doubt about it at all. But those opposite cannot run away from the fact that economic stimulus has been powerful in supporting employment in the Australian economy. If it had not have been for the economic stimulus put in place by the government, the economy would have gone backwards by 1.3 per cent in the year through to June. That is 200,000-plus Australians in jobs today and into the future as a consequence of that economic stimulus, and that would not have been the case if those opposite had had their way. If those opposite had had their way, Australia would be in a recession right now. That would have been the consequence of the policies that they have advocated in this House.There is no doubt that Australia's performance has come from a variety of factors, but the economic stimulus put in place by this government was powerful. That has been acknowledged by the OECD today. It has been acknowledged by the IMF. It has been acknowledged by the World Bank. It has been acknowledged by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry today. It has been acknowledged by the Ai Group. It has been acknowledged by the BCA. It has been acknowledged by everybody, bar those who sit on the other side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Yesterday the OECD released a report on the employment outlook for 2009, and it makes for sobering reading for the global economy, particularly on employment. It says that OECD economies are facing a jobs crisis, and goes on to note that 15 million people have joined the ranks of the unemployed across the developed economies since the end of 2007. It says specifically that the experience of previous severe economic downturns suggest that unemployment will continue to rise for some time, even after the recovery begins, and that it will take a long time to re-absorb the upsurge in unemployment.The OECD forecasts unemployment reaching nearly 10 per cent by the end of 2010 across the developed economies. If those projections are realised, that will mean that unemployment will have risen by some 25 million across the developed economies since the beginning of this crisis. It is a sobering reminder as to who pays the price in a global financial crisis. When you have unrestrained greed and unregulated financial markets, those who pay the price are working families everywhere.The OECD indicates that stimulus has had an important impact on the macroeconomic response to this crisis worldwide. It says:Job losses would be significantly larger if vigorous macroeconomic measures had not been taken.Indeed, it is estimated that the OECD area employment will be 0.8 per cent to 1.4 per cent higher in 2010 than would have been the case had national governments not adopted sizeable, fiscal stimulus packages. The OECD also says that the Australian stimulus has been particularly effective in saving jobs. It says:Even though many countries moved quickly to enact large fiscal stimulus packages, these packages generally have not had a strong effect in cushioning the initial decline in employment caused by the crisis, although Australia is a notable exception.So says the OECD in its reflections on developed economies everywhere. It goes on to say:Australia's fiscal stimulus package seems to have had a strong effect in cushioning the decline in employment caused by the global economic downturn.In particular, the OECD suggests the jobs impact in 2010 of Australia's fiscal stimulus package will be 1.4 to 1.9 per cent. This is around 200,000 jobs - confirming, therefore, Treasury's analysis.The OECD's conclusions on this matter stand in stark contrast to the observations which have been made from time to time by those opposite about the impact of economic stimulus and fiscal stimulus on the real economy. The Leader of the Opposition has criticised the government's stimulus package for 'not creating one job' - that is what he said. He has also said of the stimulus package: 'No discernible impact on our economy'; 'It hasn't created a job'; and 'It hasn't stopped us from going backwards in terms of economic growth.'However, with the production of this most recent report, the opposition did have a chance to rise to the occasion and to help build the Australian economy up rather than simply continue to talk it down. But they chose instead to continue to talk the economy down. When the Leader of the Opposition was asked this morning on this question about the conclusions of the OECD report on stimulus and what it had to say about Australia, he had this to say: 'Well, it's only a very little report. The OECD has not taken into account a number of factors in that very short little paper.' - This report is 300 pages, Joe. That is a 300-page analysis of the global economy. We are one member of the OECD. This is an analysis of the global economy and this is that very short little paper to which he alludes.The Australian government has, through its stimulus strategy, sought to build up the entire economy. We have therefore, as a consequence of our actions and the engagement of the entire Australian economy, produced one which among the major advanced economies is the fastest growing. We have the second lowest unemployment, the lowest debt and the lowest deficit, and we are the only one not to have gone into recession. This is not, however, the time for complacency. We have challenges ahead to build long-term productivity growth for the Australian economy for the recovery and, on top of that, to engage our colleagues in the G20 with the long-term task of medium-term exit from these extraordinary stimulus measures and building long-term sustainable economic growth. That is the government's strategy. I would encourage those opposite to get on board and help build the Australian economy up.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. It is the case that the IMF estimates that he refers to are somewhat lower than the medium-term forecasts that we have put in our budget. That has been obvious for a long period of time. It has taken the member for North Sydney a long time to catch up with that bit of data but it is the sort of sloppy performance we have seen from him in this House over a long period of time, such as demeaning the OECD report by claiming that it has only got two pages worth of analysis that is relevant to Australia when this is a major report of very significant standing which shows that the economic stimulus this government has put in place has had a powerful effect and has resulted in a situation where in excess of 200,000 Australians are in employment who would not have been if we had adopted the approach that had been outlined by those opposite.Their approach is simply to sit, to wait and to see. The consequence of that approach, if it had been implemented by those opposite, would have been that Australia would now be in recession. And any of the medium-term forecasts that were in place would be far worse if those opposite had their way because the whole point of economic stimulus is to get in there and prevent the economic damage that prolonged and high unemployment and business failures do to an economy. That is the whole case for putting economic stimulus in place: to avert that damage and to avert the drop in private demand which damages the economy. None of these things are understood by any of those opposite and it just shows how unqualified they are to make any judgments about the Australian economy.The member has mentioned the IMF. I would like to go to the IMF and quote from its managing director, Mr Strauss-Kahn, who overnight had this to say:The global economy is starting to recover. Most data confirms global economic stabilisation _                _            _            _But the recovery remains very fragile. Private demand is still weak, financial tensions weigh on consumption which means there are still free resources in the economy, and unemployment will continue to grow.The Prime Minister has already been through the conclusions of the OECD report and indeed they are very gloomy in terms of the employment outlook across the OECD. In 2010, across the OECD, we are looking at unemployment in the order of 10 per cent -  - Our response to a global recession immediately is important, and that has been demonstrated by the OECD report today. But the government, when it brought down its last budget, put in place a medium-term fiscal strategy because that is important in order to return the budget to surplus as quickly as we possibly can when the global economy recovers. And we have got our fiscal rules. We are going to put them into place. We will have our two per cent expenditure cap in place when growth moves above trend. If those opposite want to pretend that somehow Australia is completely immune from global growth, let them do so. But the one thing I can say is that Australia is in one of the best positions of any of the advanced economies to handle these very challenging circumstances, particularly when it comes to employment. And we will do everything within our power to support employment, to support business and to bring the budget back into surplus as quickly as we possibly can given the global conditions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and know about his deep concern for supporting jobs today during the days of the global recession. Today the OECD, in its 2009 OECD employment outlook, has delivered powerful new evidence that the government's decisive action to combat the global recession by nation building for recovery is supporting jobs and supporting small business as we invest in the infrastructure that this nation needs for tomorrow. The OECD report is powerful evidence that this economic stimulus is working. As the Treasurer has said, the OECD estimates that Australia's fiscal stimulus package will result in employment in 2010 being 1.4 to 1.9 per cent higher than if no stimulus measures had been implemented.When we look at the construction activity that is being supported by the government's economic stimulus package it tells a powerful story. Let us look at other OECD nations. This report gives us the construction activity in Spain, which has seen catastrophic drops of 26 per cent in the year to the first quarter of 2009. We have seen catastrophic drops in the United States - a drop of 14 per cent in the year to 2009. By contrast, because economic stimulus in this country is supporting jobs, the ABS labour force data for the August 2009 quarter showed that employment decreased in our construction sector by around 0.5 per cent. This is powerful evidence that the economic stimulus is working to support jobs today.The Building the Education Revolution program is the centrepiece of the government's stimulus program. It is supporting jobs through construction activity right around the country. It is supporting tradespeople and small businesses and it is supporting young people in training, keeping them in all-important employment. The Leader of the Opposition used to wander around saying he was about jobs, jobs and jobs. We do not hear that any more because to be about jobs, jobs and jobs you have to be ready to act decisively in the face of a global challenge like the global recession - to act early and provide fiscal stimulus, provide economic stimulus while building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. That is exactly what Building the Education Revolution is about - jobs today while we build the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history.</DOC>

 - I am very glad the Leader of the Opposition asked me about the Productivity Places Program because it enables me to explain three things about it - three vital aspects of this program. There is the stream that the Leader of the Opposition has referred to, which is the stream supporting job seekers, and obviously that stream is very important during the days of the global recession. It is not easy during a global recession, as unemployment in this country rises, to assist into work people who have been unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed. This is a program that has delivered training to more than 100,000 Australians. Just over 30,000 have completed their training and, of those referred by employment services providers, we have seen people get jobs. I think that kind of support for training of job seekers during a global recession is vitally important.Importantly, the Productivity Places Program has been sufficiently flexible through our structural adjustment places to support people in jobs in companies that are bearing the brunt of the global recession. To take just one example of that - the example of Holden: I think that everyone would be aware that the global financial crisis and global recession have borne down on the car industry. People would be aware of the circumstances faced by General Motors in the United States. Our structural adjustment places through the Productivity Places Program have been able to partner with a business like Holden so that they could strike short-time working arrangements and we could provide training places so people stay in a job and upskill during the days of a global recession that is bringing powerful force to bear on that business. If we had not had that flexible response through the Productivity Places Program, if we had not had the kind of cooperative workplace relations necessary to strike that sort of arrangement, what we could have seen is large-scale redundancies. We know from statistics that for people who lose their jobs during an economic downturn it can be a long, long way back.The third stream of the Productivity Places Program is to assist with upskilling people in the current workforce. We are committed to broadening and deepening the skills of Australian working people. This is a program that has responded flexibly to difficult circumstances. - What I think is important is understanding the full breadth of this program and how it is supporting jobs and job seekers. It is one part of our investment in training. There is more than $5 billion in addition in apprenticeships and related measures. We are also moving to an uncapped system of higher education places so more Australians get the benefit of university training. This is a suite of related measures to solve the skills crisis. - Can I say in conclusion that, if the Leader of the Opposition is genuinely interested in the full suite of training measures and how they are working with job seekers and working to support employment then he should study all of the Productivity Places Program measures and all of our apprenticeship measures as well as what we are doing with the biggest structural changes to higher education since the Dawkins reforms. I would also ask the Leader of the Opposition to contemplate where we would be with unemployment numbers right now if we had kept the skills settings which created the skills crisis of the Liberal government and if we had not provided economic stimulus, which was his policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question because the OECD report delivered overnight has provided powerful new evidence that the stimulus measures in Australia have led the advanced world in their impact. I would like to quote the OECD report. It says:Even though many countries moved quickly to enact large fiscal stimulus packages, these packages generally have not had a strong effect in cushioning the initial decline in employment caused by the crisis, although Australia is a notable exception.Australia's fiscal stimulus package seems to have had a strong effect in cushioning the decline in employment caused by the global economic downturn.This is a fact denied by every one of those opposite. The reason for this is that the government moved quickly, decisively and powerfully to support jobs in the face of a very sharp contraction across both advanced and developing economies around the world in both the December and the March quarters. The government have supported activity, supported jobs and provided a massive boost to confidence, although we do have some very substantial employment challenges still before us across a range of sectors, including retail.But the good news is that today we have seen the Sensis business confidence figures. These figures show that business confidence in Australia has risen to its highest level since August 2007. Sensis finds today that small businesses are more optimistic about Australia's economic direction than they have been in more than a decade - that is, this survey identifies the government's economic stimulus as a key factor behind the improvement in confidence. This is yet more evidence of what the OECD has found and said in their report issued overnight.As I was saying earlier, there is broad support in the community for the government's economic stimulus program. Today, the ACCI, who were looking at the Westpac Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's survey of industrial trends, have commented. This is their conclusion:Overall, we don't think it is an environment where there should be any winding back of the stimulus measures given the general fragility of the economy.That is a very strong case which backs up the assessments of the IMF, the OECD, all of the business sector in this country and the community more generally - everybody except those opposite.</DOC>

 - I presume that as the question has been asked people would want to hear the answer. The answer is -  -  -  - I am very happy to answer the question. - The shadow minister is right when he says that in the building industry we have federal safety arrangements, including the special OH&amp;S accreditation arrangements to which he refers. Ordinarily, when the federal government puts major investment into economic stimulus or into major capital in the building industry, we deal with businesses who are already accredited under the code. When we are dealing with small capital improvements like schools, these small capital improvements tend to be under the financial level for these sorts of arrangements. What we did with the OH&amp;S arrangements in relation to the Building the Education Revolution, in order to maximise the number of businesses that could tender quickly, was rely on the occupational health and safety arrangements around the country that apply to workers around the country. So, for example, for construction -  - in the shadow minister's home state of Western Australia, the occupational health and safety arrangements for workers engaged in building a Building the Education Revolution project in one of his local schools would be the Western Australian government's occupational health and safety legislation. If he believes that the occupational health and safety legislation of the Western Australian government is deficient then perhaps he ought to take that up with his friends in the Liberal Party. Occupational health and safety law, as it applies to workers generally around the country, applies to workers who are constructing under the Building the Education Revolution program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. She is someone who is always concerned about the issue of jobs and business opportunities for Australian companies. In that context, the parliament welcomed the final investment decision by the Gorgon joint venture partners on Monday for a project worth $43 billion. The joint venture partners Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell will fund this project from their own balance sheets and in doing so deliver 10,000 direct and indirect jobs during the construction period alone. I also welcomed on Tuesday evening Chevron entering into a further heads of agreement for the long-term supply of Gorgon LNG to Korea, potentially opening up a much expanded LNG trading partnership between Australia and Korea - potentially a further export opportunity of 1.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG.As is always the case with major projects such as this, it is now the responsibility of government to actually work with industry to guarantee the maximum available job opportunities in an immediate sense. That was the very question put to the joint venture partners at the announcement of the project in Perth on Monday. In that context I am delighted to advise the House that, when it comes to jobs, jobs and more jobs for Australians, project construction is already moving forward. Already $2 billion worth of contracts have been awarded - many to major Australian based companies. For example, Thiess has won a $500 million contract for site preparation on Barrow Island. In a joint venture partnership, Thiess, with Decmil Pty Ltd and Kentz Pty Ltd, has been awarded a further $520 million contract to build the 3,300-bed Gorgon construction village. This will mean jobs on the ground, of great benefit to all Australians. It is also interesting to note that Toll Holdings has won a $180 million contract for the Barrow Island supply base and logistics.I go to the issue of Mermaid Marine Australia and its further $100 million contract for providing access to the Dampier marine supply base, and the Australian Marine Complex and LandCorp has been contracted to provide waterfront roll on, roll off ferry terminal and wharf facilities at Cockburn Sound near Fremantle. In addition to this, the Offshore Marine Services alliance has won a $240 million contract for tugs and barges, and Agility Logistics a $160 million contract for supply base operations and transportation services between Perth and Dampier and the supply base and Cockburn Sound. Schenker Australia will also conduct freight-forwarding activities.As we all appreciate, the magnitude of the Gorgon project is demonstrated by the fact that it will be the biggest and most challenging private logistics and supply chain exercise ever attempted in the world. Can I also say that in the immediate future a further $10 billion of contracts will be rolled out over the next three months, including this week's award of an additional $2.7 billion engineering, procurement and construction management contract to the Kellogg joint venture, consisting of Kellogg, Brown and Root, JGC Corporation and the Australian based companies Clough and Hatch.This is a project that will deliver Australia thousands of jobs and training opportunities, contracting and business opportunities, and associated prosperity. It will also deliver across the length and breadth of Australia. In announcing the project the joint venture partners also very clearly indicated that Australia is now very well placed to achieve further major investments akin to the Gorgon investment. I refer to the statements, for example, by George Kirkland - an executive vice president of Chevron. He said:There's no doubt that this positions Australia very, very strongly in the gas world. It really and truly does.The good news is Saudi Arabia is all about oil, and what we're seeing in Australia is all about gas. And for the future, and when you consider the environmental side, Australia is in a great, great position _He went on to say:Asia has been growing, growing significantly. And where's Australia? Great position to really deliver on a cost advantage basis, that market.I will leave you with those comments. The Gorgon project is a great achievement for Australia. It means real jobs and business opportunities here on the ground now. And, more importantly, it is a very strong statement to the world that Australia is alive for investment opportunities akin to Gorgon. It is now our responsibility to make Gorgon a success and to deliver the jobs on the ground, and in doing so attract further investment akin to Gorgon.</DOC>

 - The Australian government is resolved to honour its commitments to the WA government, whoever won the last WA election; and we will do it. The reason for this is that the WA government is actually in the business of rolling up its sleeves and making projects work. That is why this government is working effectively with them. I also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that, on the broader question of economic policy, the WA Treasurer, Mr Buswell, has fully endorsed the overall economic strategy of this government - including its stimulus strategy. We work well with them and will continue to do so into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for the question. It is a deeply important issue, given what happened in the Senate on Tuesday night. Late on Tuesday night the coalition took a sledgehammer to Australia's quarantine and biosecurity budget, ripping $103 million out of our biosecurity defences. This was done by the same mob that presided over equine influenza - the same Leader of the National Party. It might be 95 per cent of Australians who do not know who he is, but every person involved in the racing industry knows exactly who he is because they took a $1 billion hit when they were dealing with the system with a previous government that was not willing to commit to biosecurity in Australia. The same people who in government gave us quarantine incompetence and neglect, in opposition have decided to vandalise Australia's quarantine and biosecurity systems - vandalism against the same issue that I always thought was above politics. I actually thought, if we were going to have an argument about quarantine and biosecurity, the argument from the opposition would be that there needs to be more money, not that you need to take $103 million out of our quarantine and biosecurity.Every year new fees come in. Every year new fees are introduced, and yet in the history of Australia's biosecurity cost recovery never has either side of politics disallowed the new fees. It has never been done before. We had only eight years in the history of biosecurity where the 40 per cent export subsidy was there, and when it was introduced last time by the Leader of the Nationals he himself said it was a four-year program. He himself announced the expiry date - that there would be no funding beyond 30 June this year. We kept to that date, but we went one step further. We put through a transition year, a further $40 million on the table. Then on Monday, when the Senate inquiry reported and said more transition money was required, Senator Back himself stood up in the parliament and nominated the figure of $20 million. We put a further $20 million on the table to help with the transition year, to help our exporters.What did they do? Let's not forget their proposal: zero dollars on the table. We put $60 million on the table. They were faced with a choice between driving policy reform at $60 million or sabotaging the quarantine budget, and they just could not help themselves. They had not done enough damage to quarantine in government; they had to continue the assault in opposition. The shadow minister himself only a few months ago said any cuts to the biosecurity budget would be 'criminal' - and look at what you have now done. Look at what the opposition has now done in slashing the biosecurity budget by $100 million.The government did the right thing. We made sure these fees were gazetted earlier than they ordinarily would be so that, if the opposition were minded to behave this way, it could have been done before the end of the financial year. But instead they chose the option of maximum chaos - have the new fees come in, have industry, in good faith, begin the process of reform and then steal the money from underneath, despite the support from the Meat Industry Council, the Livestock Exporters Council, the Dairy Industry Council, GrainCorp, ABB, Horticulture Australia, the Seafood Export Consultative Committee, the Red Meat Advisory Council, Dairy Farmers, Grain Traders, Biological Farmers and the Aquaculture Council. All of these groups want the reform process to go ahead, and against all of them the National Party decided, 'Let's just play politics.'Every month this goes on, $3 million to $4 million disappears because of the underfunding of biosecurity that Australia now has. There is time when we come back to be able to fix this and to allow industry to have its reform process and not have the cut which is currently being made to quarantine. I would ask the opposition to think very long and hard about the demands of industry and actually deliver on a reform package that they were incapable of in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Warringah for his question and for the opportunity that it gives me to confirm the statements and the commitments that this government has made to make sure that 85 houses are built in the Alice Springs town camps. Of course, he should be aware that the Northern Territory government has since corrected the statements that he has now, I suspect, brought to the dispatch box knowing that they have since corrected them.I might just say, while I have the opportunity to contribute to this debate, it was that side of the parliament when they were in government who walked away from the residents of the Alice Springs town camps. The previous minister for Indigenous affairs went up to Alice Springs and said that he would do something about the conditions that people were living in in Alice Springs and he walked away from them. He walked away from the people who are living in the most appalling conditions that we would find in any part of this country. This is not a war zone. This is not a refugee camp. This is on the outskirts of one of our country towns. It is an out-and-out disgrace that for 12 years you left people living in those conditions, and it is now up to this government to fix it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I am happy to take on notice that particular matter that he refers to, see whether there is additional information in relation to the views that he has put to me about that, come back to the House and report to them. But I make that response in the context of issues that have been raised by the opposition previously, including that by the member for Hinkler which I referred to in question time yesterday. We found that, on examining the view of the company in question that the member purported to represent here in the parliament, in actual fact the claims that the member made in the parliament were false. - I make the point to the House that since the inception of this program two things have happened. The first is that we have had a record number of ceiling insulations take place in a record short period of time. This was for a program that those opposite opposed. The second thing is that we have put in place a range of compliance and auditing measures in order to make sure that the taxpayer gets very good value for this program that the government is delivering. Let us remember that we are delivering a program that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, that employs Australians, that puts ceiling insulation in the roof to enable Australians to lower their energy costs and -  -  - I am reminded by the opposition making these claims in the parliament that when the member for Flinders went into hysterical mode about solar panels earlier in the year - when we discovered that he was jumping out of a plane without a parachute, so to speak - the number of solar panels that were going onto roofs -  - I simply make the point that one listens carefully to the questions that are put by the opposition and to the views that are put by the opposition, and when it comes to some members of the opposition - in particular the member for Flinders, who said that this program was falling apart at the seams when we had 290,000 installations - I think it is time to put these questions in context. But we will take seriously the question that the member has put. I will come back to the House. I make this final point. If we are serious about addressing climate change - as we are on this side of the House - then the Energy Efficient Homes Program, which has only 0.3 per cent of actual issues that have been raised on a program that up to this point in time has been phenomenally successful in its deployment, is doing the job that it was required to do.</DOC>

 - Of course it is extremely important that the parliament pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation so that we can begin to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own economy and play the most constructive role possible in the international community. Time is pressing for the passage of the government's legislation. The Copenhagen conference is now less than 90 days away and it is important that the legislation pass before then, not only so that we can have a target established in the law to reduce carbon pollution in this country but also to have a means to achieve the reductions. After today, there are only four weeks of sittings left before the Copenhagen conference, and the government will be reintroducing this legislation with that time frame well and truly in mind. That means that time is running out for the coalition on this fundamentally important public policy question.I confirm once again that the government will sit down and negotiate with the opposition if they can produce a set of amendments that reflect the policy concerns that they have. But they must have a policy and they must agree to a proposed set of amendments. The government cannot do that for them as Senator Minchin has been suggesting. They have to get their act together and develop a policy with specific amendments to the legislation that they are seeking.But, of course, as is evidenced again today, the outlook for that development on the opposition side of politics is not good. Multiple positions are being expressed on climate change. It is truly astonishing. It is a very rare thing in Australian politics for such extraordinary ill-discipline and disunity to be on display by a major political party. The Nationals and the Liberals have completely split over this issue, and Senator Joyce is running the leadership on this issue for the National Party and, apparently at times, for the coalition. Senator Joyce is making ridiculous propositions, proposing homespun messages that defy the international scientific evidence and consensus on the need for taking action on climate change. He has been positing $150 legs of lamb and other ridiculous propositions. The position that the National Party has been adopting is at potentially massive cost to the rural and agricultural communities that the National Party purports to represent. It is an utterly irresponsible position.Senator Joyce has walked all over the member for Wide Bay, the Leader of the Nationals - walked all over him. Only two or three months ago the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party stood up and said they were committed to the government's targeted reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. That is no longer the case. The National Party has dumped that position.For once I have to say that I agree with the member for Sturt - as painful as it may be - because this morning on Sky television the member for Sturt indicated that the Nationals are no longer at the table and that their policy position is bizarre. That was his admission. But, of course, the National Party is not alone in that. The Liberals are in a shemozzle on this as well. Over the last two days we have had a party room rebellion fully reported to the media, including the speakers list; at least three contradictory positions on amendments to the legislation; the member for Higgins out again in the media, making a typically self-indulgent and destructive contribution, opposing emissions trading; and the member for O'Connor continuing to run an insurgency campaign, asserting that a majority of the coalition party room are opposed to emissions trading. The member for Goldstein, not in the chamber today, has taken a completely contradictory position -  - At the same time that the member for O'Connor is asserting that a majority of the coalition party room is opposed to emissions trading, the member for Goldstein is reported in the Australian today saying that a vast majority of coalition MPs and senators in fact support amending the CPRS. Who is to ever know who is right about the coalition political and policy position on this issue? If it is a majority of coalition MPs that support negotiating amendments with the government, it must be a very silent majority indeed. They should take responsibility on this critical public policy issue and put forward specific amendments, propose them to the government and negotiate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I did notice that she was conferring with the Leader of the Opposition before the question. That is because the Leader of the Opposition does not have the integrity to ask the question himself. -  - I withdraw. Can I say in relation to this matter that I am also aware that the member for North Sydney was involved in the construction of this question, as are, of course, all members of the tactics committee of the opposition. -  - Can I say, in relation to this matter, that this government takes border protection very, very seriously. In fact, we have dedicated -  -  - Of course, I know there are different views amongst the opposition. We know the member for Pearce, the member for McMillan and the member for Kooyong have a different view with respect to these matters but -  - In relation to the question asked by the honourable member, I am not aware of the comments made by the minister, to which Dr Stone referred in the question. This government takes border protection very seriously. It is for that reason we have dedicated $654 million to protecting our borders. It is for that reason that we have a policy that ensures we work with governments within our region and we work with the law enforcement agencies. Only very recently there was a disruption of the syndicates in Indonesia. That was a direct result of the efforts of this government's work with the Indonesian National Police to disrupt those ventures and to prosecute the people smugglers. It is the case that there has been an increase in unlawful maritime arrivals. I make this very important point: if we were to determine a government's performance based on unlawful or irregular maritime arrivals, then the Howard government's record was the worst in the last 40 years. In relation to the capacity of the detention centre on Christmas Island, it is very clear that -  - In conclusion, the detention centre at Christmas Island still has plenty of capacity to deal with any irregular maritime arrivals. This is an effort by the opposition to dog whistle - that is what they have been doing here -  - The Leader of the Opposition should be ashamed of himself for putting up the honourable member to ask this question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question and for his very hard work on behalf of more than 23½ thousand pensioners in his electorate of Longman. From this Sunday, Australian pensioners will receive their long overdue and much needed increase to the pension. Those opposite had 12 long years to deliver an increase to the pension, and they refused to do so. They refused to deliver this much needed increase to the pension. It has been left to this government to deliver what pensioners have needed for so long.Over the next two weeks, pensioners will be receiving this much needed increase to their pension, on their usual pension pay day. These 3.3 million pensioners - aged pensioners, disability support pensioners, veterans, income support recipients, those on the carer payment - will receive, because of this government's commitment, a much needed pension rise. All pensioners will get letters from Centrelink setting out exactly what they will receive. Single pensioners on the maximum rate will receive an ongoing increase - not the sort of temporary increase we saw from the previous government before elections. From this government they will get an ongoing increase of $70.83 a fortnight for singles on the maximum rate. These are very significant reforms that will make a difference to the living standards of single pensioners.Couples on the maximum rate of the pension combined will receive $29.93 a fortnight. Once again, this is a much-needed increase. All of us on this side of the parliament know that pensioners have been doing it very, very hard. I have spoken to many pensioners, but one pensioner to whom I spoke just last week comes to mind. I will tell everybody what this pensioner had to say to me about what this increase will mean for her. She is a single pensioner on the maximum rate and she will be receiving an increase of $70.83 a fortnight from next week. This is a lady who is very active, very involved, and she says that she is going to live a much more social life as a result of this increase. She will be able to go out with her friends, enjoy exercise classes and do some of the things which other people take for granted. These are the practical things. These are the changes that pensioners are going to see as a result of this very significant increase to the pension. It is going to mean a better life in retirement for those pensioners, because this government have done what pensioners have been waiting for for a very long time. We have delivered this very important increase to improve their standard of living - especially for those in retirement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. Of course, the member for Lyne was the only non-government member of parliament to vote for and support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme - an act of courage that is important to acknowledge. I recall that when the CPRS legislation was in the House in June, the member for Lyne moved an amendment in very similar terms to those in his question to me. It raises the same important public policy question, and that is whether or not the proposed Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority should be able to independently set the cap on emissions. As I recall, that was the nature of the amendment at the time, and I take it that the question has a similar intent.As I explained to the House at that time, the scheme caps, in the government's view - reflected, of course, in the way in which the legislation has been constructed - should be set in regulations rather than by an independent authority, and that remains our view of this issue. The setting of scheme caps, I think on any construction, is a very major policy decision requiring the balancing of broad environmental, economic and social factors. As a consequence it is in itself a very important public policy question. The government took the view, through the consultations in the development of the white paper in particular, that such an important decision should be taken by elected officials of this parliament and should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. For that reason, the government remain committed to the approach that we have articulated.I would emphasise, though - as I think I did at the time in June - that the government certainly welcomes the member for Lyne's participation in the debate of these important issues and the recognition of the serious challenge that climate change presents. In particular, the government welcomes the member for Lyne's commitment to supporting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That is exactly the type of engagement that those opposite, members of the Liberal and National parties, should also be engaging in: taking responsibility for the greatest challenge of our time - a responsibility that to date they have demonstrably shirked.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I know that she is deeply committed to fairness and decency in Australian workplaces. I know that she saw, as many other members in this House saw, under the Liberal government's Work Choices regime hardworking Australians getting basic pay and conditions and being ripped off without a cent of compensation. As the parliament draws to a close for a parliamentary fortnight, the overwhelming impression from this fortnight is that the Liberal Party is a political party stuck in the past and divided about its future - stuck in the 1960s, as we saw on display during question time. They are stuck in an era of climate change denial and divided about the future strategy for climate change. They are divided and unsure what to do with the Building the Education Revolution program, equivocating between saying and doing anything to discredit it and trying to associate themselves with it whilst they are at home.But there is no better example of how the Liberal Party is stuck in the past than the embrace of Work Choices we have seen this fortnight. What the Liberal Party has said on the record about Work Choices is characteristic of the kind of divided views we hear about so many issues. There are various factions in the Liberal Party when it comes to what they will say publicly about Work Choices. When it comes to what they will say publicly about award-stripping Australian workplace agreements, there is one faction centred around the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She is straightforward about what she believes in. She is a loud and proud supporter of Australian workplace agreements and she is on the record as saying, 'We have said common-law agreements are no substitute for statutory agreements.'Then there are those who pretend in public that they believe Work Choices is dead and buried. There is probably no more louder proponent of this than the former Work Choices salesman, the current shadow Treasurer, who each and every day up until the 2007 election spruiked the benefits of Work Choices. But now he seeks to be taken seriously and says things like, 'Work Choices is dead; it's very dead.'Then there is a third faction in the Liberal Party when it comes to Work Choices and Australian workplace agreements. There is the 'let's bide our time' faction led by the member for Warringah, who is saying basically: 'We shouldn't come clean now. It may all be different by polling day.' On Kerry O'Brien's 7.30 Report, he said:_ we took our lumps on polling day and we accepted the verdict by effectively not opposing the Government's workplace legislation. But things, I suspect, will be a little different by the time the next polling day comes around.The 'wait and see and then get it all back out of box before the election' faction.Then there is the faction that says the brand known as Work Choices is dead but Work Choices itself is alive. We have seen a number from this faction. Senator Mitch Fifield is a member of this faction. He said:Don't get me wrong. Of course, the brand and policy iteration known as 'Work Choices' is dead.The member for O'Connor has put it even more frankly. He said:The only problem with Work Choices was its name.Which faction is the Leader of the Opposition in? True to a man desperately seeking support from any corner of his political party, he has been in all of them. At the Press Club on 25 November 2008, there he was saying very clearly:We have heard the lessons of the 2007 election loud and clear.WorkChoices is dead. The people have spoken.Then, by March 2009, he was actually trying to blame that political position on the former Leader of the Opposition, the member of Bradfield, when on radio he said:The person who said WorkChoices was dead was Brendan Nelson after the election.Last weekend, we saw the Leader of the Opposition come out loud and proud as a Work Choices supporter. He is refusing to rule out individual statutory employment agreements. He is refusing to rule them out because he knows the one thing that unites the Liberal Party under all this division about public positioning is that they are the party of Work Choices and rip-offs. They were when they were in government, they are now and they will always be the party of Work Choices and ripping off working Australians. That is the position of Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

I also draw the honourable member's attention to the recommendations contained within that report requiring further action by the federal government. I further draw the honourable member's attention to the response provided to those recommendations. Secondly, on the specific matter which the honourable member has raised, can I say to him, as I have said in the past to the member for McMillan, the member for McEwen and other members from the bushfire affected areas, if there are particular local concerns which those members wish me to attend to then I will seek to do so based on their individual representations to me and to my office. Thirdly, I refer to the honourable member's correspondence. I will now investigate what has happened in response to his correspondence, and I am happy to take it up individually with the member as he has suggested in the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. As he knows, this program has been extremely well received by local communities right around the nation because it has resulted in jobs being created in the short term based upon local communities' priorities themselves as expressed through their elected local representatives in local government. It is also building infrastructure that will last for the long term.Indeed, last Friday I had the pleasure of taking the opportunity to open the extensively upgraded Clementson Park at Bondi Junction, just around the corner from the electorate office of the member for Wentworth. All up, Waverley Council's playground upgrade program received some $340,000. The work undertaken by the council involved an extensive refurbishment of the park and included the construction of a new playground, which will benefit the childcare centre that is just near the park. Further work is taking place at eight other parks around Wentworth. The Liberal mayor, Sally Betts, said:Council and our community are very thankful for this funding from the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program.It was a very successful launch, which the Liberal mayor, the Liberal deputy mayor and all the Liberal councillors came along to to express their support for economic stimulus on the ground in Wentworth.Of course, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, himself said, when he attended the launch of the community infrastructure program in his electorate on 26 April:We have never argued about investing in infrastructure. We support investing in infrastructure _But they have come in here day after day and opposed the infrastructure investment in schools, in local communities, in housing, in insulation. They have opposed the 70 per cent of the economic stimulus plan that goes into infrastructure. One thing the Leader of the Opposition has said is that it would not create one job. I say to the member for Wentworth that he should go around the corner from his electorate office, because -  - it is not far, as the Deputy Prime Minister says, and because this upgrade alone created work opportunities for 30 people. Thirty people worked on this playground alone. Of course - and the Deputy Prime Minister has tried to explain the way that construction works - they have employed contractors from the private sector. The contractors involved in this upgrade informed us last week that they were ready to make lay-offs. Instead, they kept people employed and, in addition, were able to employ an extra apprentice, giving a young person an opportunity in life.It may well be that the member for Wentworth sees this local contractor as part of the G20 conspiracy of left-wing leaders, part of the OECD - maybe he has become part of that conspiracy at the moment. But the fact of the matter is this: they are arguing the economic stimulus should stop. What they need to do is to identify those projects in their electorates that they think should not occur, because they argue that in here but not when they go back to their electorates. Here is a photo of the member for Wentworth on 26 April at the Waverley Park pavilion. Here we have the member for Riverina on 7 May out in Wagga Wagga. Here we have the member for Mallee - dancing. -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker - and a fine ruling, Mr Speaker. - I do not know why they do not wish to give prominence to what they are doing outside in their electorates. Here we have a photo of the member for Gilmore giving the thumbs up to the program in the Shoalhaven, and the member for Mayo out there supporting projects - The member for Fisher then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Warringah for his question and particularly for the opportunity that it gives me to reiterate this government's commitment to the Northern Territory emergency response. This government and I think I can say every member of this parliament understand that we do have a national responsibility to address what is an emergency in many parts of the Northern Territory. - I might just say to all of those opposite who are interjecting that probably the most significant indication of our commitment to the Northern Territory emergency response is not about one position; it is about dedicating $800 million from this budget to make sure that the Northern Territory emergency response continues over the next three years - $800 million that was not provided by the previous government but provided in this budget by this government to make sure that we have the funding for additional police to make sure that we are able to fund night patrols in remote country communities in the Northern Territory and to make sure that we continue the program of income management. It is now the case that 15,000 people in the Northern Territory are being income managed. As a result of that income management we are seeing more children getting better fed. These are very difficult issues that we have introduced and we intend to continue them, as is evidenced in our budgetary commitment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. Overnight, we have seen more evidence of the response of international economic organisations to Australia's economic management over the last 18 months. The OECD has given further evidence that the stimulus measures put in place by the Rudd government have worked to cushion the impacts of the global recession. The OECD also points out that rising unemployment will continue to be a serious problem in economies, including Australia's. To keep the unemployment rate steady we need to create around 20,000 jobs a month, which is a serious challenge in this international environment. This is a challenge that requires stimulus to remain in place - a fact established and supported internationally. Over the last fortnight we have heard Dominique Strauss-Kahn and senior officials from the White House and the G20 endorse the need to keep stimulus in place. Over the course of the last 48 hours we have heard the Prime Minister of Great Britain endorse the need to keep stimulus in place. In a speech to the Trades Union Congress in the United Kingdom he stressed 'the need to implement fiscal stimulus packages in full without stopping them prematurely'. The British Prime Minister also laid out the need to keep stimulus in place by saying:And we still have big choices to make. The choice of whether we continue to act to help families and businesses or whether we listen to the Tories and withdraw support from families and businesses, cut public services now, and refuse to invest in Britain's future.Anyone who would characterise that speech as anything other than a call to keep stimulus in place is engaging in false and misleading conduct.I am asked about what impediments there are to coordinated action on fiscal stimulus. One of the things in place is those opposite who make things up in their argument against coordinated fiscal stimulus. This has been a shocker of a fortnight for the economic credibility of the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues. Last week we had the Robert doctrine, which was to say that Australia is the only nation in the world not withdrawing stimulus. Simply untrue. That was followed by the Hockey hypothesis, which was to say, 'Maybe that's not right but it's all a left-wing conspiracy.' Then we had the shadow Treasurer saying that keeping interest rates low was more important than supporting jobs. Today we have seen the Leader of the Opposition distance himself from his own shadow Treasurer on that particular item. Now the G20 conspiracy has been replaced by the phantom Gordon Brown speech from the shadow Treasurer. Not content with dreaming up conspiracies, the shadow Treasurer is now drafting phantom speeches. - Next we will have the shadow Treasurer quoting a speech from Al Gore saying that climate change is not real or we might have him quoting that famous speech from Mahatma Gandhi saying that peaceful protest is not all it is cracked up to be! Given the OECD's endorsement of this government's policies, I am surprised that he has not alleged that OECD stands for the organisation of eccentric communist dictators. That is what you would expect from the shadow Treasurer.The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have been wandering around like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, trying to find evidence to support their fantasies that the stimulus is not working and should be withdrawn. But in political discourse in Australia you just cannot make things up; you have to have some evidence. The shadow Treasurer, as he said, stood twice yesterday in the House to take a personal explanation. He should come back into the House today and take another one and explain why he has not yet come clean about misleading the Australian people and misleading the House about the Prime Minister of Britain. His attempt to mitigate this deception is based around where the quotation marks were placed in his remarks. That is his defence - the old 'quotation marks' defence. What he ignores is the fact that the very fibre of the Prime Minister of Great Britain's speech was to defend economic stimulus. At least when the former shadow Treasurer plagiarised a speech she got the quotes right. This one cannot even get that.The shadow Treasurer should come back into the chamber this afternoon after question time and take another personal explanation. He should explain whether he was being dishonest or just plain sloppy.</DOC>

 - As the Leader of the Opposition asked this question could I draw his attention to this fact, and it relates to both the opposition's policy and the government's, and that is our respective commitments to a five per cent unilateral reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 15 per cent conditional reduction and a further 25 per cent conditional reduction. What do the latter two reductions depend upon? They depend upon the outcome of the Copenhagen conference on climate change. The honourable gentleman asks the question. That is the response.In relation to the further point that the honourable member makes as far as climate change is concerned, and the opposition's meeting yesterday and the statement that they have issued concerning their position on climate change, could I say the government welcomes the fact that the opposition have made such a statement. Over the next six weeks of the Australian parliament we will get a chance to debate this properly in the House of Representatives and the Senate for a second time. This afternoon the climate change minister will be meeting with the opposition outlining our timetable for action on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This six-week timetable for action is to ensure both chambers have the time to consider and debate the bill in an orderly and detailed manner.The bill will be introduced into the House on Thursday. It will be debated in the House next week and voted on in the House in the week beginning Monday, 16 November. It will be introduced in the Senate immediately after the vote in the House. It will then be voted on in the Senate in the week beginning 23 November. The government has of course offered to extend sittings this year if the opposition requires more time. We have six weeks to finally achieve action on climate change - six weeks to make up for what has been in effect 12 years of delay. And I say again to the honourable Leader of the Opposition that if further time is required for the debate on this matter then of course the government stands ready to facilitate the opposition.Given the timetable, we look forward of course to receiving from the opposition their detailed written amendments. That is an appropriate course of action. We look forward also to receiving from the opposition their detailed costings of the amendments they have put forward. We also look forward to receiving the opposition's analysis of the emissions consequences of the individual measures that they have put forward. The government's legislation and associated white paper have been in the public domain since March of this year.In relation to the cost, I would also say that the government's primary objective has been to set in place a system that reduces carbon pollution and supports economic growth, and we believe we have got the balance right. I would draw the attention of the House to a comment made by the opposition spokesman on climate change yesterday, I believe, when he said:Every industry will pay under the opposition's amendments. Every industry will get a cost from the emissions trading scheme. Agriculture will get a cost because they will be paying the emissions trading scheme price on their diesel, on their electricity, on their natural gas. Every industry will be paying.I quote the shadow minister for climate change or the spokesman on the same. That underpins the necessity for us to in fact have the costings and analysis which underpin the amendments which have been put forward by the opposition. We look forward to receiving that information.After the significant period of delay under the previous government when it comes to taking action on climate change, we look forward to engaging in this discussion with the opposition on achieving an outcome for Australia. This is one of the world's hottest and driest continents and, as a consequence, climate change will hit Australia hardest and earliest. Therefore, it is important that the nation come together and get an outcome for the future. In the lead up to the Copenhagen conference, which has also been the subject of a reference in the Leader of the Opposition's question, most countries around the world will be seeking to move forward in advancing this agenda. It will be a very difficult process. But, in terms of the relevance of our actions here in Australia and the negotiations which unfold globally, there is of course a clear connection, and that is that the rest of the world will legitimately ask questions about what action we are taking in Australia in order to encourage actions by other emitting economies around the world, both developed and developing.In reference to the Leader of the Opposition's question about the relevance of Copenhagen to the timetabling of debate in the House and the Senate this year, I draw his attention to his own statement, in his own opinion piece in July last year, in which he said:_ 'our first-hand experience in implementing _ an emissions trading system' would be of considerable assistance in our international discussions and negotiations aimed at achieving an effective global _ agreement.Furthermore, Tony Abbott, the shadow minister for families, has written in today's Australian, and I quote him directly to the Leader of the Opposition. He said:It could indeed help the outcome of the Copenhagen climate change talks if Australia agreed in advance not only to a carbon emissions target but also on a mechanism to deliver it.That is what the shadow minister for families said today and that is what the Leader of the Opposition said last year. Of course it is the government's view too that the conclusion of such an agreement here in Australia on the future of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme would assist international negotiations because we in Australia have a big interest in global outcomes. We also need to provide for business certainty. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Twelve months ago the global economy embarked upon one of the most significant challenges in our lifetimes when we confronted the prospect of not just global financial markets collapsing, global credit markets freezing and a tumbling in stock prices around the world but also one economy after another collapsing into recession and unemployment rising right across the world. This has been a most difficult year for the global economy and, despite the progress which has been achieved in recent times, we still face great challenges ahead, particularly when it comes to supporting the needs of jobs both at home and around the world.The global response to this global crisis has, of course, been coordinated through the G20. This has been an important mechanism of global cooperation. We met in Washington, we met in London and, most recently, we met in Pittsburgh. Most critical to the outcomes of the G20 has been the decision by governments across the world to get behind the $5½ trillion worth of stimulus into the global economy - in other words, to provide that necessary injection of activity into the global economy through public investment when the private sector worldwide has been in retreat. Of course, the result of this virtually unprecedented level of global economic cooperation and coordination has been that credit markets have begun to thaw, and we have seen stock markets begin to recover, we have seen job losses in some areas avoided and we have seen the beginnings of the return of confidence. In fact, many have remarked that the G20 summit in London represented the break in the fall of the global confidence cycle both for consumers and for business and the beginning of the turn in some of the global growth indicators.This, however, is not a recipe for complacency. We must get on with the business of implementing the Pittsburgh agenda. Firstly, we must get on with the business of implementing a sustainable framework for long-term economic growth, the reason being that we cannot afford a simple return back to the global macroeconomic imbalances which underpinned so many of the challenges that we faced at the time the subprime crisis took off. Secondly, we must also implement the Pittsburgh agenda when it comes to reducing risk-taking in financial markets in a responsible manner. Hence the recommendations in Pittsburgh to increase the capital adequacy requirements of financial institutions. Hence also the recommendation to adjust remuneration arrangements for financial executives to make them more calibrated to long-term performance rather than short-term risk. Thirdly, we must implement the necessary reforms for the global financial institutions as a necessary backstop to future crises and reducing the risk of future crises unfolding.The good news for Australia is that the G20 has now been entrenched as the premier forum for global economic cooperation. This is an important development for Australia. Secondly, as a result of that, Australia now has a seat at the top economic table when it comes to global economic decision-making. Thirdly, as a consequence of that, Australia's voice at head-of-government level is now heard directly rather than through the medium of other countries. This is a good development in terms of Australia's voice in the big challenges which still lie ahead for the global economy.Our global action has been proceeding along these lines. Our domestic action the House will be familiar with - the actions that we took to stabilise financial markets with bank guarantees and also our intervention in terms of the three sets of stimulus packages in order to step in and play our part with global stimulus investments in order to keep the economy going when the private sector was in such retreat. We have done so entirely consistent with the principles of conservative economic management. We have done so in a manner whereby we have properly expanded the role of government when the private sector is in retreat and we have properly begun to retract the role of government as the private sector shows evidence of recovering. We have done so while maintaining our AAA credit rating, we have done so with the lowest debt across the major advanced economies and we have also done so with a clear plan, announced in the budget, for returning the budget to surplus. The result of these measures is that Australia has the fastest-growing economy across the 33 members of the OECD. It is the only one among the major advanced economies not to have gone into recession. It has the second-lowest unemployment and also the lowest net debt and the lowest deficit.These are good achievements for Australia, but, looking ahead, the uncertainties still in the global economy are real. We must be vigilant about that, as the Treasurer has said repeatedly. We must also be very mindful in monitoring developments in the global economy - the international economy - and the domestic economy in terms of our own future fiscal policy settings, and we will continue to do so. The absolute cornerstone of this government's strategy for the year past and the future is our absolute commitment to do whatever is necessary to support the jobs of Australian working families in dealing with this global economic crisis for which they were not the cause.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It related to 79 people who have been transferred to Oceanic Viking. These matters and the treatment of those seeking asylum to Australia are significant issues. It is appropriate that these issues are raised in this parliament. I note that, for instance, over the weekend there were demonstrations either way, highlighting the political controversy in Italy, for instance. I think it is appropriate that we debate these issues sensibly in this parliament. It involves unquestionably complex international issues. In that context the member asked about these people. It obviously relates to the maritime border between Australia and Indonesia. I refer the honourable member to President Yudhoyono's comments that these matters have to be resolved, one working with the other throughout our region.The Prime Minister has indicated that this is a significant issue. We make no apologies for taking a hard-line response. At the same time, we are dealing with human beings. -  - I refer honourable members opposite to an editorial over the weekend in, I think, the Sydney Morning Herald which said that, given that fact, our responses need to be proportionate and calm. With the greatest respect to the honourable member, the approach should be taken on that basis. These matters will obviously be the subjects of discussions, and have been the subjects of discussions -  - In the context of maintaining a hard-line border protection policy, in the context of maintaining a response that is proportionate and calm, in the context of acknowledging that we are dealing with the safety of human beings at sea and in the context of international treaty obligations respectively on the parts of Indonesia and Australia, I, while I am representing the minister for immigration in this House, can indicate that Australia and Indonesia are in discussions as to the safest place to accommodate these people, given that they were rescued at sea, in the context of our respective maritime safety obligations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. Both fiscal and monetary policies have been working hand in hand to support our economy, to support jobs and to support small business during this global recession. Indeed, as the Prime Minister was saying before, some very significant interventions took place. They took place one year ago last week. One year ago last week we put in place the bank guarantee and the term 'funding guarantee' - absolutely essential to ensuring the flow of credit continued in the Australian economy. It was a very important decision that was the subject of much strident criticism by the Leader of the Opposition over a prolonged period of time, and it is one of the reasons why Australia has done so much better than the rest of the world.One year ago last Wednesday was the anniversary of the economic stimulus package - phase I of economic stimulus. It was followed by phase II in February this year. Those actions combined mean that Australia was the fastest growing advanced economy through to the June quarter - a very good result for Australia. That means many more people were in work and many more businesses kept their doors open because the government moved quickly and powerfully to put in place supports for the Australian economy in the middle of what had become a global recession.There is an Access Economics report out today which comments on these matters. It makes the legitimate point that it was the interventions by the Australian government - the bank guarantee and of course our three phases of economic stimulus - that have meant that Australia has performed the best of all advanced economies and was the only one to grow in the year through to the June quarter. It makes the comment that Australia's growth performance has been world beating, because Australians work together and work with the framework put in place by the government to ensure that we minimise the impacts of the global recession on this country.But Access have cautioned against complacency and have also warned that the economic recovery is likely to be soft and slow. Access stressed that the planned withdrawal of stimulus will mean stiffer headwinds into the recovery - stiffer headwinds than many people realise. So it is the case that both fiscal and monetary policies are being withdrawn gradually as the economy strengthens. It is our job to ensure that the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus does occur gradually and carefully and in a way that does not jeopardise economic recovery. The fiscal stimulus was designed to have a significant impact on growth quickly and then be withdrawn gradually as the economy recovered. Economic stimulus, or fiscal stimulus, had its maximum impact in the June quarter this year. It subtracts from growth in every quarter next year. In combination with the Reserve Bank, this means that fiscal and monetary policy will continue to work in the same direction.This was a point made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank at a Senate inquiry last month. I want to quote what he said about the design of our fiscal stimulus and what he said about the inbuilt phase down of the stimulus. He said:Such an outcome would mean that fiscal and monetary policy would be acting broadly consistently, as they did when they were moved in the expansionary direction when the economy was slowing.This point has been made by many in business as well. They understand that the stimulus is being carefully and gradually withdrawn as we go through next year. They also understand that, given the uncertain international environment, this is the way to proceed. To suddenly withdraw all of the stimulus, as those opposite advocate, would have a dramatic impact on employment and a dramatic impact on business in this economy, and that is certainly not the way to goSometimes I contemplate where Australia would have been if the government had accepted the advice of those opposite last February. Unemployment would be far higher, more businesses would have hit the wall because they opposed economic stimulus all of the way. They opposed the bank guarantee as well - a monumental misjudgement from this Leader of the Opposition. Fortunately, we did not take their advice and tens of thousands of Australians are in work and tens of thousands of small businesses remain open for business.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It is an important one. Clearly, we are dealing with a very complex global issue. There is no doubt that people smuggling in our region but also around the world is a challenge for all First World nations. For that reason, can I say to the honourable member that of course we will be concerned about these matters. But I have to say to her that there is no doubt that the clear evidence is that the reason why there is an increased likelihood of people seeking haven in First World countries is as a result of the conflicts around the world. -  - In relation to this particular matter, it is therefore important that we deal with it properly and we deal with it with our friends within the region. This is a complex issue. It is a delicate one. I have not been provided advice other than the clear view that this is as a result of the conflicts that are occurring in Afghanistan and the very long, bloody civil conflict that occurred in Sri Lanka. For that reason, we will continue to dedicate our resources to prevent, wherever possible, those seeking haven in this country, if it is not done properly. We will continue to dedicate our resources in Indonesia, in Sri Lanka and in other places in the region to ensure that we do not endanger the lives of those people, in many cases desperate people, seeking haven in First World countries.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question and know that she has been very concerned during the days of the global recession to support jobs in her local community. The government welcomed the fact that, in September, the unemployment rate in this country fell to 5.7 per cent. That was as a result of 40,600 Australians finding work. What this shows is that our stimulus measures are clearly working. We are building the schools, ports, road, rail and broadband we need for the future. It is also abundantly clear that without economic stimulus Australia would be in recession right now and hundreds of thousands of Australians would be out of work.Treasury has estimated that, if all of the stimulus which was expected to impact in 2010-11 were to be cancelled, this would result in a loss of up to an additional 100,000 jobs and a further contraction in the growth rate of real GDP of 1½ per cent - some very sobering statistics for those opposite who have opposed economic stimulus every step of the way. However, we are also aware that when you look behind the unemployment rate itself, you find that over the last year the level of full-time employment has fallen by 151,300, or two per cent, which has resulted in the unemployment rate rising by 1.4 percentage points. The fact remains that there are still over 658,000 Australians who want a job but do not have one.Globally, the growth outlook is still weak with other major advanced economies in recession. Although some economic forecasters are now revising up their projected growth numbers, most remain very cautious. For instance, in the IMF's recent World Economic Outlook in October 2009, growth has been revised up but the tone was cautious with a warning that the economic recovery is likely to be slow because global financial systems remain impaired. While the Access Economics report released today is much more optimistic, it predicts world output will contract by one per cent in 2009. Access Economics has also revised down its projected peak in the unemployment rate to 6.7 per cent in late 2010. This is an optimistic forecast, which in part is driven by ringing endorsement of stimulus, an assessment that the economic stimulus that the government has provided is no longer merely putting a floor under activity but is boosting it. It is the economic stimulus which we have provided here and has been provided around the world by other governments acting in a similar fashion.The government will release updated figures in MYEFO as normal and although the pace of decline in labour market activity will not be as severe as earlier envisaged, a number of forward indicators are continuing to point to soft labour market conditions over 2009. The grim news for Australians is employment numbers are a lagged economic indicator and unemployment is not yet at its peak. It is therefore vital that the government's fiscal stimulus measures be left in place, with a gradual phase-out in order to keep Australians working now and into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, which goes to the question of what constitutes the driving factors behind international people movements. That is the question he asks. He asks: what are the constituent elements of it? He asks: whether it is in fact domestic policies or whether it is international push factors, what is the relevance of all of the above? The second part of his question dealt with also what he described as a recent increase in activity. Could I put this into context. The Leader of the Opposition should know that in the period of the Howard government nearly 250 vessels arrived in this country. They brought to Australia almost 15,000. I am also advised that of those issued with what was then described as temporary protection visas, some 90 to 95 per cent were then granted permanent residency in Australia. Let us put this into context. Secondly, I can say to the honourable gentleman that he goes to the question of changes in the last few years. In the period we have been in government - bearing in mind that the Howard government had almost 250 vessels arrive, bringing almost 15,000 people - we have had something like 38 vessels arrive with about 1,700 people. So far, this runs at an average of 20 per year. It will go up and it will go down, but that is basically the average over the period of the Howard government.The honourable member then asked the question about driving factors. I noticed that the honourable member goes to the question of domestic policy. One of the domestic policies which I presume, listening to those opposite, they wish the government to now embrace, is temporary protection visas. I say to those opposite that in the two years following the introduction of temporary protection visas some 8,000 to 9,000 people came to this county on up to 100 vessels. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, as he embarks upon what is obviously a conscious and deliberate debate in this place, for conscious and deliberate reasons, that it is important to place his question entirely in its numerical context.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Indeed, I was in South Australia just last week with the Prime Minister and with Premier Mike Rann unveiling the design concept for the new South Road Superway. The federal government is investing some half a billion dollars in the upgrade of the South Road, with the state government contributing $430 million.This road will be the backbone of a dedicated north-south transport corridor for Adelaide. The superway will connect from the Port River Expressway to Regency Road and will reduce travel times by up to seven minutes. Importantly, this project is expected to support some 2,750 jobs during construction. It is exactly what this government's infrastructure plans are all about: supporting jobs today by building the infrastructure that we need for tomorrow. Construction on local roads will commence in March 2010.The member for Kingston, who asked this question, will be particularly pleased to learn that work is progressing very swiftly on the Seaford rail extension. Expressions of interest from construction companies interested in building this $291 million rail extension were called for today. Whether it is road or rail, both of them providing assistance in terms of input to the port, we are moving forward in South Australia. Indeed, this project in the member for Kingston's electorate will help to generate up to 400 jobs during construction. While we are getting on with the job of building infrastructure in South Australia, in conjunction with the South Australian government, those opposite disparage these projects, are opposed to these jobs being created and are opposed to this infrastructure being built. That is consistent with what they have been saying on the record. During the break, in an article headed 'Time to rethink infrastructure cash splash,' Senator Coonan, the shadow minister for finance, is reported as saying:_ the government should start by looking at the $8.5 billion earmarked in this year's budget for a series of road, rail and ports projects.There they are, on the record, saying that the infrastructure agenda of the government should be wound back. That is consistent, of course, because the Leader of the Opposition also visited Adelaide, back in May, and he had this to say about the infrastructure projects funded in the budget:_everything will have to be reviewed. There's no question about that.What I say to the opposition is that they need to come clean with the voters of Kingston, the voters of Port Adelaide, the voters of Adelaide, the voters of Hindmarsh, the voters of Sturt and the voters in the other seats in Adelaide about which projects they will cancel. They need to be clear: is it the Gawler rail electrification; is it the Noarlunga to Seaford rail extension? Which projects will they cancel? It is quite clear that they have learnt nothing from their 12 years of neglect of infrastructure. They opposed infrastructure investment when they were in government; they continue to oppose it from opposition.</DOC>

 - I very much welcome the question from the member for Warringah as it gives me an opportunity to set the record straight. Not surprisingly, everything he had to say today is totally false. Let us go to a few of the facts. It is the case that in 2006, following the closure of the Woomera detention centre, and then in 2007, following the closure of the Baxter detention centre, the previous government moved a number of demountables to Alice Springs. The previous government said at the time that they were going to use these demountables for the Alice Springs town camps. These are the facts. What actually happened was that the previous Minister for Indigenous Affairs decided to walk away completely from the Alice Springs town camp residents. Not one of these demountables was used by the previous government for the residents of the Alice Springs town camps. The reason that not one of these demountables was used is this that the previous minister decided to walk away completely - to completely ignore the needs of the Alice Springs town camp residents.By contrast, instead of walking away from the Alice Springs town camp residents this government has decided to use the demountables. Since we have been in government 230 demountables have been used. Absolutely none were used by the previous government - they walked away from the residents of the Alice Springs town camps - but 230 of the demountables have been deployed by this government in Indigenous communities: 230 of them used by this government, none used by the previous government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know that she has been very concerned to keep her constituents in work and to support jobs during these difficult days of the global recession. As the member for Page is aware, last week the government released our Keep Australia Working report. This report arises from forums around the country, Keep Australia Working forums where we have listened to the voices of local communities, particularly local communities most at risk of rising unemployment, during these days of the global recession. I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the government to thank Lindsay Fox and Bill Kelty, for their leadership role in those forums, and to thank my parliamentary colleagues Senator Mark Arbib and Parliamentary Secretary Jason Clare for their role in leading those 21 forums around the country. There have been a number of messages from those forums which are important to the government and important to policy development, but one of the very important messages was the communities are already thinking and working for recovery and in doing that they are determined not to let our young people down and not to let our young people bear the brunt of this economic downturn in the way they have borne the brunt of economic downturns in the past. On the question of the impact on our young people, recently released data shows that trade apprenticeship commencements in traditional trade areas have fallen by more than 20 per cent over the last year. Obviously, we want to arrest that decline and, in order to give young people an opportunity, we have moved to better support apprenticeships. As a result of this information, the government is finetuning its economic stimulus to ensure that the right skills are provided to assist business while at the same time giving new apprentices a great start. This measure is all about ensuring stimulus continues as we build a better future for apprentices and Australian businesses.So, having heard the voice of local communities last week, I announced a key initiative to redirect some of the Jobs Fund's money towards a $100 million apprenticeship kick-start package. This shift in funding has been supported by and agreed with our Jobs Fund partners, the Greens and Senator Fielding. This new initiative to kick-start apprenticeships will more than triple the first year incentive paid to employers who take on a traditional trade apprentice this summer. This means that an employer who acts quickly and picks up a kid coming out of school this year will get more than triple the normal incentive for doing so. The cost of this is $80 million. It will only be available over the coming summer period. It only applies to employers who take on apprentices aged 19 or younger. It is a highly focused, highly targeted kick-start for young Australians into apprenticeships in traditional trades. A further $20 million will boost our pre-apprenticeship programs which assist young people to get a quick start into trades. This measure will be about traditional apprentices. It will be about butchers, bakers, electricians, mechanics, plumbers - all of the traditional trades that people identify as a great opportunity for a young Australian. The measure has got the strong support of the Australian Contractors Association, the Ai Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the ACTU and Group Training Australia. I hope that members in this House will get behind this measure and that they will help their local communities and particularly their local employers to get the necessary information to ensure that they can participate in this apprenticeship kick-start program. With this new initiative and the Securing Australian Apprentices measure announced in February, the government will be investing an additional quarter of a billion dollars to support the apprenticeship system over the next 18 months. That is an investment we can be proud of and one to make a difference in the lives of young Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I would have thought that here in 2009 at last the opposition could have said that the government's stimulus strategy has succeeded in assisting Australia to remain out of recession, that at last the Leader of the Opposition could summon the courage to say that we have prevented hundreds of thousands of Australians from losing their jobs and that the government stimulus strategy has been remarkably successful by any global benchmark in preventing this economy from sliding into recession. These are the measurable achievements of what the government has done, in partnership with the business community and in partnership with the unions as well, in seeking to ensure that Australia came through this global economic crisis in the best possible repair, bearing in mind that we had so many economies around the world falling over one at a time. It is very difficult to know where the Leader of the Opposition actually stands on the question of stimulus. He draws attention, for example, to Access Economics today. The Access Economics report Business Outlook dated 19 October 2009 says, 'Australia's growth performance has been world beating.' I do not seem to remember that being referred to in the quote by the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Richardson went on to say:We didn't dodge a bullet, we outran it _ We sailed through the worst of the global crisis on a sea of stimulus - both our own and China's.That is what Access Economics have said. Access Economics also go on to say that there are still uncertainties out there in the global economy. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Access Economics have also said that there are still grave uncertainties which are alive out there in the global economy and they have specifically warned about what follows as stimulus tails down. They have specifically warned about the impact on small business and jobs. Therefore I would draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to one core fact, and that is the internal design characteristics of the stimulus strategy in the first place, which was designed to surge maximally at the very beginning of the crisis and then to tail down over time. Remember that the IMF, in October 2008, characterised appropriate fiscal stimulus in these following terms. It needed to be 'timely, targeted and temporary for it to be effective'. If this government has embarked upon a strategy like this - which we have - then the results are there in the economic data for all to see.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: he really needs to sort out where the opposition stand on the question of stimulus, because, when this debate on the global economic recession and Australia's response to it began, they came out and supported it. Then after a period of time the member for North Sydney went out there and said they just wanted $20 billion less - remember that statement? It was in the lead-up to the budget of this year, I seem to recall. Since then we do not quite know where they stand, but it seems to be that they stand for 95 per cent of the stimulus which the government has embraced. That is actually what they say in substance, yet in the public debate they pretend they have not embraced any of that stimulus support whatsoever.The bottom line is that, as of the June quarter this year, the government's stimulus strategy has already peaked and is coming down consistent with its design characteristics. That is how it was put together in the first place. In phase I of the stimulus, we have already seen, I believe - I am advised - some 93 per cent of that already invested. By the time we get to the conclusion of this financial year, two-thirds of the stimulus will have been invested. That is what being targeted and temporary is all about - necessary to support jobs, necessary to support small business and necessary to support tradies. We are in the business of making a difference in the economy, and guess what? This government has acted in concert with each and every other government across the G20 economies in embracing a similar approach to stimulus. That is why we took concerted action as the G20 to inject $5.5 trillion worth of global stimulus into a $63 trillion global economy.What is the alternative which the opposition would suggest? Their preference, when it is all stripped away, is to actually have people's jobs destroyed. That is it in a nutshell. They would prefer to stand back and allow the economic, employment and human carnage to unfold. Their preference would be for unemployment queues to be snaking outside every Centrelink office in Australia, getting longer and longer, because they know, and all the analysts have said, that what makes up the difference is the stimulus strategy - together with the actions taken by the Reserve Bank in its monetary policy settings.Our policy on this is clear-cut. It is consistent with the G20 global economies. We take jobs and the protection of jobs as absolutely core business for the future. Those opposite, it seems, now believe that people's jobs can be just held to ransom, thrown down the drain. Forget the human consequences and - let me say this - forget also that in so doing they would be consigning Australia to increased pressures on the budget through rising unemployment benefits and declining taxation receipts as a consequence of higher unemployment.What is the net result? This economy in Australia has produced the fastest growth in the OECD. It has produced the highest growth of the major advanced economies. It has produced the second-lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies. It is the only economy not to have gone into recession. - Right on cue, the member for Sturt says, 'What about debt?' The economy also has produced the lowest debt and the lowest deficit of all the major advanced economies. I thank the member for Sturt for his interjection.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Pakistan faces a grave threat from terrorism and extremism. In recent weeks and in the last two months we have seen very serious attacks on the Pakistan people and very serious attacks on and intimidation of their democratic and political institutions. Australia strongly condemns this recent string of terrible attacks. We have seen those attacks in Lahore, in the North-West Frontier Province, in Peshawar and also in Rawalpindi. They have caused serious loss of life, and we extend our condolences to the Pakistan government and the Pakistan people.These series of terrible attacks show the gravity of the threat that Pakistan faces. But these series of attacks have also enabled the international community to underline the strength of the international community's resolve to stand shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan at a time when it faces very serious economic, social and security challenges.Australia was one of the first countries of the international community to appreciate that Pakistan was facing these very serious problems. We were a foundation member of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan, and I attended that ministerial level meeting - the first meeting - in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly in September last year. I visited Pakistan in February this year and announced a doubling of our development assistance and also a substantial increase in the number of Pakistan military and defence officers who come to Canberra for short- and long-term courses for the purposes of training, particularly in counterterrorism.This year, in the margins of the General Assembly, Prime Minister Gordon Brown, President Zadari and President Obama jointly chaired a leaders summit of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan. The Prime Minister attended; I attended with him. In the course of that summit the Prime Minister announced that Australia would increase the number of Pakistan defence and military officers that are trained to 140, making Australia the second largest trainer and provider of expertise in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency to the Pakistan defence forces. Secondly, we announced the establishment of the Australia-Pakistan Development Partnership to bring a significant focus to our development assistance activity, substantially underlining our support in the international assistance for the Malakand project. We also agreed to breathe life back into the Australia-Pakistan Joint Trade Committee, underlining that we need to assist Pakistan on a security, an economic and a social front.Pakistan is of great strategic importance. It is crucially located in South Asia. Population projections see that before the middle of this century it will overtake Indonesia as the largest Muslim populated country in the world. And, of course, it has nuclear weapons. Pakistan is essential to the stabilisation of Afghanistan and vital to international community efforts to combat terrorism and extremism.We have seen in recent days the Pakistan government and the Pakistan military launch an operation against the extremists in South Waziristan. We are under no illusions as to the difficulty of this exercise. We are under no illusions that this will see the Pakistan people and the Pakistan military suffer further sacrifices and further loss of life. But we welcome very much the Pakistan government's appreciation that the threats we have seen on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border are a threat to their very existence, and we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the rest of the international community in Pakistan's hour of need.</DOC>

 - It does not take them long to get back to a scare campaign on interest rates, does it? Everybody in this House remembers the last time those opposite got up here and ran a scare campaign on interest rates. It was back in about 2006, after an election where they promised to keep interest rates at record lows. That was the television advertising. Of course, then rates went up 10 times - 10 times, after they promised to keep rates at record lows. In the middle of that, we had a revelation from the now Leader of the Opposition. When they went up a fifth or six time, the Leader of the Opposition was asked about one of these 25 basis point rises and he said they were 'over dramatised'.The opposition have form on interest rates and they have form on scare campaigns. They are now attempting to mount one on the decision of the Reserve Bank to put up interest rates by 25 basis points from their 50-year emergency low. The Reserve Bank governor made the position here absolutely clear. He said that when rates are at an emergency low, they will at some time in the future move from that emergency low when the emergency has finished. That was the point that he made after the Reserve Bank board's decision.The Governor of the Reserve Bank has been absolutely emphatic that his decision has been taken to move those interest rates from an emergency level because the economy is recovering and it has got nothing to do with the government's fiscal policy. He made that absolutely, emphatically clear on two occasions, including at the end of September when he kicked most of the opposition who were at the parliamentary hearing out of the room when they were asking their dorothy dixers and did not get the answers they wanted on this and many other questions. He explicitly repudiated the proposition that has been put forward by the shadow Assistant Treasurer. He made it very clear that rates are moving from emergency lows because the economy is recovering.The fact is that monetary policy and fiscal policy are both working together as the economy recovers. Any attempt by those opposite to somehow blame interest rate rises on the fact that the economy is recovering and suggest that it has got something to do with fiscal stimulus shows how desperate they are. It absolutely shows how unfit for government they are as well because they want to pretend that somehow emergency level, 50-year lows could just magically stay there forever. Well, they cannot and those opposite know it. When they seek to argue that, they show how unqualified they are for government and how unfit they are to conduct a sensible debate about how we go through recovery from the impact of a global recession. They have been repudiated by the Reserve Bank governor, they have been repudiated by most respected commentators and, of course, they have become a laughing stock as a consequence because they are putting forward propositions which do not add up. What it shows is monumental incompetence.Mr Garnaut did make some comments. He heartily endorsed the government's fiscal stimulus strategy and made the unremarkable comment that it should be withdrawn gradually over time. It was an unremarkable comment because it is being withdrawn over time. It will subtract from growth every quarter next year. But the proposition being put forward by those opposite is that all of it should be immediately withdrawn. The Secretary of the Treasury gave evidence to the parliamentary committee about that as well and pointed out that the impact of that would be the loss of a further 100,000 jobs and the closure of tens of thousands of small businesses. So what the shadow Assistant Treasurer has demonstrated in the House today, indeed as the Leader of the Opposition has demonstrated since this decision was taken by the Reserve Bank, is how unfit they are for government and how unqualified they are to be taking the sorts of judgements that are required by governments in these circumstances to carefully manage a recovery.That is what we will do. We will carefully manage this recovery. We most certainly will not take their advice to rip the rug out from underneath that recovery by pulling stimulus out altogether. That is their proposition. It shows that they simply do not understand the importance of jobs, do not understand the importance of small business and do not understand the importance of stimulus to sustaining prosperity in this economy during a period of great uncertainty in the global economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. He has campaigned strongly to inform people about the impact of climate change in his electorate. The government is very committed to addressing the challenge that climate change represents. That is why over a long period of time and with very extensive consultation the government has done the detailed policy work to formulate the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is our intention to prosecute that legislation through the parliament this year so that we can tackle the threat the climate change represents.It is also becoming increasingly important to prosecute that legislation to address the issue of business certainty. Business groups like the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia want to see the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme voted on this year so that members of those business organisations can begin making long-term investments. On this issue, Ms Heather Ridout, the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group said only a few days ago -  - I will tell you. She said:Many of our members are telling us that they are holding off making investment decisions until there is a greater degree of clarity around domestic climate change legislation.It only stands to reason that this uncertainty needs to be ended. You only have to consider, for example, the very significant investments that would be in contemplation in the New South Wales energy industry right now and the importance it is for those potential private investors to understand what the carbon price may be, how it will be set and how the market will operate in the carbon industry in order for them to be properly able to model and predict the investments and the returns that they will make.In addition to the issue of business certainty, it is also very important that in the lead-up to the Copenhagen conference we ensure that we prosecute the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation through the parliament so that the Australian government has the best negotiating capacity and strength possible so that it can influence an outcome at that important conference. This is an argument that the government has been advancing for some time but - as the Prime Minister pointed out earlier - in an opinion piece in the Australian newspaper today, the member for Warringah emphasised this particular point. He said:It could indeed help the outcome of the Copenhagen climate change talks if Australia agreed in advance not only to a carbon emissions target but also on a mechanism to deliver it.That particular extract is a very welcome extract.The government, as the Prime Minister indicated, welcomes the fact that the opposition has developed a set of proposals and looks forward to seeing the detailed amendments. I understand that during question time a piece of correspondence has been received in the office of the Minister for Climate Change and Water. I have not had the opportunity to review that correspondence at this stage. But it is extremely important that the government receives the detailed amendments from the opposition so that we can get on with the business of negotiating these issues in good faith.There are two important aspects regarding any amendments put forward by the opposition. Quite simply, they must be environmentally credible and fiscally responsible. Last night, the member for Groom made three important claims at a press conference. He stated that the proposals that the opposition has formulated would: firstly be self-funding, secondly, achieve exactly the same level of emissions reductions as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and, thirdly, mean that no households will be worse off. The government looks forward to receiving the detailed explanation and data that underpins those particular claims and we expect - and it will be important for us to see - that particular information when we receive the proposed amendments.The CPRS bills, as the Prime Minister indicated, will be introduced into this House this Thursday and debated in this House next week. The bills will also be introduced into the Senate following a vote in the House in the week beginning Monday 16 November. Let me be extremely clear about this: the government wants to pass this legislation and make this very important reform. That is why it is vital that the coalition opposition negotiate in good faith. The Leader of the Opposition has said that the opposition will negotiate in good faith. In order to demonstrate that, it is now also important for them to produce the detail and the data that underpins it for us to ensure that these proposals are environmentally credible and fiscally responsible. Furthermore, the opposition must commit to voting on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation this year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is an important question, because it has been the case during the global recession that credit has been difficult in some areas of the economy as a consequence of the global recession. That is certainly the case in areas of small business. - The bank guarantee that they opposed was the lifeline of the Australian economy. - You sure have a funny way of supporting it. You are in this House day after day, week after week, opposing the guarantee, which was absolutely critical to ensuring the flow of credit to the Australian economy. But it is the case that some small businesses are finding it tough to get credit. I happen to have the view that the banks could do a better job, and they should. So we might agree on one thing: the banks ought to be doing a bit better, particularly in some areas of small business. This is why the government outlined a proposal to issue up to a further $8 billion of residential mortgage backed securities to see if we can get more of those securities supporting small businesses. We think that is a good idea. We think it is a worthy idea. I thought it might have been one that the member opposite might have supported, but apparently not.So the government certainly is concerned about the flow of credit to small business. It is the case that things are still difficult out there for many people, which is why I cannot understand why those opposite want to be pulling stimulus out holus bolus and sending small businesses to the wall. There is a fundamental contradiction in their attitude. They go out publicly, and come into this House, saying that we should withdraw the stimulus and send thousands of small businesses and tradies to the wall. That is the proposition they put on the one hand; then the member comes in here and says he is sympathetic to the concerns of small business. Small businesses know how important the stimulus package has been for keeping their doors open - for keeping themselves and their employees employed. That has been very important but we think there is more to be done in this area, and to that extent I might agree with him. I also commiserate with him on the fact that in terms of the Gold Coast's 100 most powerful people he has fallen from 46th to 93rd.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for this question. It is a good day to be asking the question because today we are tabling the cataract regulation changes in the House. They will be tabled again in the Senate next week. The Rudd government is determined that we are going to be able to reform our health system to make it sustainable and fairer into the future. To do this we cannot reform our health system unless we make some of these hard decisions. That includes us making decisions about where we direct our finite taxpayer resources to ensure that we get best value for money. This is why the government made the decision at the last budget to adjust the Medicare fees for cataracts to better reflect the time and complexity of the procedure. The fee for this one common procedure has been reduced. This procedure commonly takes 15 to 20 minutes now. Whilst people might dispute this, it is not my view that it takes 15 to 20 minutes; it is advice from the Fred Hollows Foundation, the Australian Institute of Eye Surgery and the British Medical Journal. - Perhaps the member with some experience in matters relating to eyes might be interested to know that the British Medical Journal, as far back as 2001, said:With the remarkable improvement in cataract surgical techniques in recent years - leading to shorter operating time (most surgery now takes 15 minutes), more efficient anaesthesia (from general to regional to topical), and a trend towards day surgery - cataract extraction has become a 'minor' surgical procedure.That it not my view; it is a quote from the British Medical Journal.What we have seen since this was announced in the budget was a very slick campaign by the ophthalmologists who are, frankly, of course trying to protect their own incomes. In 2010 the highest 10 per cent of ophthalmologists earned at least $1.8 million a year. And those average-earning ophthalmologists earned $580,000 just from Medicare - not from insurers and not from gap payments - and even after this regulation is passed those who are earning average incomes will earn over half a million dollars just from Medicare.We have negotiated, also, with the profession to set a new higher fee for complex cataract procedures to fairly reflect when the procedure is more complex and takes a longer time to complete. Of course, this is an appropriate reward for specialists for the additional time and expertise they invest in longer procedures. So now is the time for the opposition to decide who they are going to support - the ophthalmologists defending their million dollar salaries or patients and taxpayers who want a fair deal.We on this side of the House want to see specialists bring their charges back to reasonable levels. It is time for taxpayers to enjoy the dividends that new medical technology and treatments have brought to patient care in recent years. Those on the other side of the House and the professions cannot expect taxpayers to keep supporting new items and new medicines if they are then blocked from enjoying the benefits and savings that flow from technology.I think everyone on this side of the House would recall that in budget week the shadow Treasurer made it clear that the opposition will support every initiative announced by the Treasurer on budget night other than the PHI - the private health insurance rebate changes. At that time the shadow Treasurer made it clear that this measure was going to be supported. Following that, the shadow Treasurer made it clear that $14 billion of spending was going to be cut but I do not see how the opposition is going to be able to honour this pledge when they cannot even decide if they will back this measure which will save Medicare $100 million over four years.Of course, such bold statements are going to require some pretty tough decisions and I was wondering if the opposition had a health spokesperson who might be able to make those sorts of tough decisions. Is there a health spokesperson with leadership and backbone? Is there a health spokesperson who is going to be able to stand up for patients and taxpayers? It is little wonder that his own party humiliated him in the seat of McPherson.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is a very good question because it goes to the impact of climate change and the response to climate change on food production, so let us consider it in those two categories. On the impact of climate change, we are engaged in this debate in the first place because climate change and its impact on drought, on fires and on water supply right across Australia is impacting agriculture. Those opposite, led by the National Party, scoff at this fact. Those opposite and the National Party in particular, led by the leader of the National Party, the alternative Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, should reflect on what ABARE has said in its stats on this. What does ABARE say about the impact of climate change on agriculture? Wheat is to fall in production by 9.2 per cent by 2030 and 13 per cent by 2050. - The climate change deniers within the National Party are out there in force even today when we are supposed to be engaged in substantive amendments for the future of a carbon pollution reduction scheme, which I thought was based on an agreement on the science. This is from ABARE. ABARE has produced these figures. ABARE projects that wheat production will fall 9.2 per cent by 2030 and 13 per cent by 2050, beef by 9.6 per cent by 2030 and 19 per cent by 2050, sheep meat down by 8.5 per cent by 2030 and 14 per cent down by 2050, dairy 9.5 per cent down by 2030 and 18 per cent by 2050, and sugar 10 per cent down by 2030 and 14 per cent down by 2050. That is why the NFF, for example, has said that it believes climate change to be 'possibly the biggest risk facing Australian farmers in the coming century'. That is the National Farmers Federation. It would seem that the National Party do not support the view of the National Farmers Federation. I find it remarkable that, given that climate change represents such a direct threat to agriculture, the question then becomes one of why the National Party want to sell agriculture down the drain over climate change. That is exactly what they are doing. They may think that there is some short-term political advantage in this for themselves, but the strategic structural threats to agriculture caused by climate change are huge, particularly in south-eastern and south-western Australia and elsewhere. - The member for O'Connor intervenes again on the question of climate change and its impact on agriculture. Can I say to the honourable member that this government and many other members in this place take the challenge to agriculture fundamentally seriously. Take the Murray-Darling: for the last 10 years we have had inflows into the Murray-Darling 50 per cent below their historical average. The impact for Australian agriculture coming out of the huge food basin in the Riverina is massive as a consequence of this. That is the challenge we are seeking to deal with. Let all those opposite engage in some reality at the moment. This is a problem to be solved, not a problem to be ignored.Moving to the other side of the question posed by the honourable member, which is the response - what you do and how you treat agriculture and how you treat food - I say to the honourable member that we are dealing with these fundamental shifts in the availability of water and with temperatures rising that also fundamentally affect the distribution of pests across Australia. It also impacts on your ability to grow in areas where it has been possible to grow particular crops in the past. That is the change which is occurring over time.On the question of the inclusion specifically of agriculture within the CPRS regime, the honourable member will be familiar with what we have done, which is to defer such a decision until further work can be done as to the desirability of its inclusion in 2015. Secondly, the other measures that we are taking by way of mitigation -  - I am always puzzled that when we are seeking to invest in rural Australia, as we are doing through the massive investment in irrigation infrastructure right now across the country - $4.8 billion worth of irrigation infrastructure - those opposite apparently have no interest in it occurring. On mitigation measures, this response to improving the efficiency of irrigation infrastructure across the country so that farmers can make better use of a dwindling resource, namely water, is one practical response.A further response on the mitigation front, which I know is relevant to the interests of the member for Kennedy in particular, is what you do in the deployment of agricultural activity more extensively across Northern Australia as well. He has raised this time and time again, and I commend him for continuing to bring this to the nation's attention. Obviously, one of the relevant factors there is the suitability of certain soil types and soil concentrations across Northern Australia to particular croppings that occur elsewhere in Australia. That is a practical fact, which is why I believe the minister, in partnership with CSIRO and others, is currently seeking to exhaustively examine the spectrum of soils which exist across Northern Australia in its long-term mitigation effect. One practical step we have taken recently in positive partnership with the government of Western Australia is what we have done for the future of the Ord. I notice the member for O'Connor suddenly goes silent at this point. We, unique compared with those who preceded us, are investing some $200 million to $300 million with the WA Liberal government for Ord stage 2, opening up arable lands in Northern Australia for cropping in the future.So we are seeking mitigation through what we are doing on the waterfront, we are seeking to expand the availability of arable land - measures taken uniquely by this government - and we are also seeking to take broader pressure off the system. Can I say to the honourable member, who asks a fair and reasonable question, that is why we are exceptionally cautious about the way we should approach the long-term inclusion of agriculture within the CPRS regime. There is much to be said about the honourable member's warning about the impact of climate change on overall food supply and production in this country. I have referred to some of the statistics from ABARE. This is a serious national-interest question. And can I say to the National Party in particular, who have already said they are not going to vote, it seems, in response to these amendments, that we need to see responsibility about the problem and the practical solutions which exist for the future because we will stand up for the farmers of Australia if those opposite refuse to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Members may have seen media reports this morning to suggest that Abraham, or Captain Bram, as he is known - a person who is well known to Indonesian and Australian authorities, a person who has previously been convicted of people-smuggling offences - had been detained by Indonesian authorities. I can confirm to the House that Indonesian authorities have advised Australian officials that Captain Bram has been detained and is currently under detention by Indonesian officials. The Australian government welcomes very much the detention and his arrest. He of course will now be subject to Indonesian criminal and judicial procedures, but this is potentially a very serious setback for people smugglers and people smuggling in our region and we welcome that.This is but another example of the very close cooperation between Australian and Indonesian authorities and officials on this matter. That cooperation has been in hand for a number of years. Since coming to office the government has moved to increase and enhance the resources allocated to combating people smuggling. It has done so in conjunction with Indonesia but also, importantly, in conjunction with other countries in our region: Malaysia, a transit country, and of course Sri Lanka, where in recent times we have seen terrible civilian conflict. We are seeing very serious push factors emanating from Sri Lanka. - We welcome very much the activities of the Indonesian authorities. We continue to work cooperatively with them. In addition to the detention of Captain Bram, we have seen over the last two to three years Indonesia disrupt in the order of 80 people-smuggling plans, very many of which were aimed at Australia. We have been working very hard in cooperation with the Indonesian authorities and, as I said, we have extended that cooperation to Malaysia and Sri Lanka. We have deployed extra resources in the last budget to that effect. -  - I also think it is appropriate to complement the work of the Australian Federal Police. It has not just been the Indonesian authorities working very hard in this area but also the Australian Federal Police, who in recent times have seen the arrest and charging of over 40 people smugglers, crew members trying to bring unlawful people to Australia. We have also seen four people in Australia arrested and charged on people-smuggling activities. - I have had a number of interjections from the other side which I will deal with in conclusion. I just want to make a number of points. I think there are three very important factors that we should focus on when dealing with these complex and difficult matters. The first is to appreciate the push factors which see somewhere between 40 million and 42 million people displaced throughout the world, about a third of which are estimated to be in or around our region. So this is not a difficulty or a problem which is exclusively aimed at Australia or Indonesia or Sri Lanka or Thailand. This is a global problem. It has very serious regional implications. We see the push factors from Afghanistan, from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area and also from Sri Lanka. As a consequence there is only one effective address to that, and that is to work very closely with our neighbours, to work very closely with source countries like Sri Lanka and transit countries like Malaysia and Indonesia and also to draw the attention very clearly of people who in many respects are the most disadvantaged in our region to the risks and the dangers of putting their lives in the hands of criminals.I have had interjections from the other side which have essentially been: 'What about the pull factors as a result of the changes that you have made?' I just say to the opposition, to the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues who sit there: you say that as a consequence of us making changes there has been the introduction of pull factors, so just tell us which of those changes you would reverse? Would you see kids behind barbed wire again? Would you put children behind barbed wire again? Would you reintroduce the Pacific solution, where processing is done on Manus Island and Nauru? Would you say it is appropriate that we discharge our international and humanitarian and legal obligations in accordance with the refugee convention by processing people on Manus Island and Nauru? Or would you reintroduce temporary protection visas, after the introduction of which we saw 10,000 people come to Australia as asylum seekers? If you stand there and say that the sum total of your argument is to identify and look at changes the government has made in processing people who come to this country, just tell us which ones you would reintroduce. Putting the kids back behind the barbed wire? Introducing temporary protection visas? Or seeking to somehow discharge our humanitarian and legal obligations by processing people in Manus Island or Nauru?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. - I noted the reports of that meeting in the press and the comments made by those who were present. I make the point to members opposite and to those listening that, in the period of time since the government announced that it would put in place an energy-efficient-homes package, we have had a number of meetings with representatives from the insulation industry and, in particular, the Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand, with whom I continue to meet. As a consequence of those meetings, which have been part of the orderly process of delivering this program, we have taken their advice on board and brought forward a program which we believe meets two aims: (1) it delivers a fiscal stimulus that is necessary to see jobs flowing through the Australian economy, which they have done, and to get insulation into the ceilings of Australian householders; and (2) it does it in a way that builds industry capacity and, additionally, enables Australians to get the benefit of the government's decision to allow them to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs. And that is what we have done.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for the question. We have already had a number of references in question time today to the different impacts of climate change in different parts of the nation. Whilst you can never pinpoint a single weather event and say it is due to climate change, it is true that the trend lines provide you with opportunities to see how events which have always occurred to some extent become more severe and occur more regularly - whether it be examples around the current drought, whether it be last year's heatwaves across South Australia and parts of Victoria or whether it be the increased severity of major weather events in the north of our country. For this reason the research into the responses needs to take account of regional differences. That is why the soil carbon work that we are doing under Australia's Farming Future, which was referred to earlier by the Prime Minister, deals with soils as far south as the electorates of Lyons, Franklin, Bass and Braddon and as far north as the electorates of Maranoa, Dawson and Kennedy.In the same way, it is important for those local experiences to find their way into discussion here in the parliament. That is why it has been my focus as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to meet with the people who work the land on their own land. I have conducted many of those visits with members opposite and members behind me in different regional seats. You need those experiences to be brought here to the parliament, whether they be from the massive pastoral properties in the north or from the smaller cattle and dairy operations in areas like Pine Rivers. The importance of an area like Pine Rivers receiving local representation was made to the parliament last year in a wonderful statement by the shadow minister for health and member for Dickson. - Referring to the part of the question about local experiences being represented here, I think the best example of that was a statement late last year by the member for Dickson. He said:But the point is that the people of Pine Rivers deserve somebody who is local, somebody who is interested in representing their own interests, and not somebody who is a seat-hopper _ - I agree that we should make sure that local experiences like those of the smaller cattle and dairy operations around areas such as Pine Rivers are represented here. That is why I agree entirely with the statement that you should not have somebody 'deciding to take residence in Pine Rivers because they do not believe they can win the seat which they are currently representing any longer'. - The member for Dickson has told the people of Dickson what he thinks of them and does not want to stick around to hear what they now think of him. The member for Moncrieff might have dropped to 93, but the member for Dickson is not on the Gold Coast list at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the opposition leader for his question. Before directly dealing with his question, perhaps I should just place a little bit of context on the record here. Of course, we know we live in a world where there is movement of people around the globe. I think we would all prefer to live in a world where there was no war or no persecution and no-one moved. But the truth is that each year of the last 20 years in this country people have arrived here by boat. This happened under the Howard government. For example, from 1998 to 2001 under the Howard government -  - As I was saying, of course, when the Howard government was in office we saw 12,176 asylum seekers -  - I am assuming that, on this important issue of public policy, people are interested in the full picture. So I am making the simple point that in each of the last 20 years we have seen unauthorised arrivals by boat. - I do thank the member for Sturt for confirming that the opposition are not interested in the full context of this complex issue. Clearly they are just interested in making cheap political points about it. To respond to the Leader of the Opposition's question, which has now been placed in a context in which it should be understood by the member for Sturt, can I respond as follows. The Australian government on the weekend responded to reports of a vessel in distress off the coast of Sumatra in the Indonesian search and rescue area. The Indonesian search and rescue authority is the lead agency and is coordinating the response. The Australian government offered assistance to the government of Indonesia and this was accepted by the Indonesian search and rescue authority. As part of its efforts to assist in the search and rescue, HMAS Armidale made contact with the vessel and to ensure the safety of the passengers the people have been taken off the vessel and are on board the Oceanic Viking. Initial indications are that there are 78 passengers on board the vessel in distress, including five women and five young children. The passengers are safe and have no major medical problems. One passenger has a fever and her condition is being monitored.As the vessel was in the Indonesian search and rescue region, Indonesia is the coordinating authority. We are consulting with the Indonesian search and rescue authority about options for bringing the rescued people to a safe place. In doing so we will follow the letter of the law in relation to this matter. International laws relating to safety of life at sea issues are in place to ensure the safety of everyone who finds themselves in distress at sea. They create a complex set of overlapping obligations that the government are currently assessing with the Indonesian government. At the conclusion of this assessment we will act in a way entirely consistent with our legal obligations. We will do so because laws associated with the safety of life at sea protect everyone who travels by sea. Those laws specifically protect Australian sailors and merchant mariners who may find themselves in distress on the high seas. Consequently we will be abiding by the letter of that international law, and we are doing so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Once again we can tell from the opposition reaction that they are not interested in the full context of supporting Australian jobs, but, let me tell you, Australians very much are. We know the impact of the global recession is still being felt around the globe. Unemployment in the US stands at 9.8 per cent, in the European Union area at 9.6 per cent, in the UK at 7.9 per cent and in Canada at 8.4 per cent. Australia's unemployment rate dropped slightly, to 5.7 per cent, in September and more than 40,000 full-time jobs were created in that month. But we need to remind ourselves, and I take this opportunity to remind the House, that thousands of Australians are doing it tough. Unemployment is 1.4 per cent higher today compared with in July last year. More than 658,000 Australians are experiencing the bitter times that unemployment brings. Others, of course, are living on short hours in cooperation with their employers to maintain employment.It is easy to rattle off statistics, but what we have to do is look at the individuals involved. Last week I received the Keep Australia working report from my parliamentary colleagues Senator Mark Arbib and parliamentary secretary Jason Clare. Their report clearly shows that the global recession is being felt particularly in parts of this country. To take one example, Cairns in Far North Queensland has had a sharp spike in its regional unemployment rate to 13.8 per cent. To keep Australians in Cairns in the electorate of Leichhardt working, we are investing $138 million in building school infrastructure, another $3.9 million in social and defence housing and $4.3 million in community based infrastructure. That is helping companies like Cairns based Metrobuild, which is currently involved in delivering $60 million in school infrastructure projects as part of our education stimulus in North Queensland. Metrobuild project administrator John Lee, the voice of a real Australian talking about this, has said:Metrobuild feels very positive about the impact of the stimulus package.He said 50 workers are directly involved in building the $3.2 million Edge Hill State School's multipurpose hall. In addition, Metrobuild is also supporting another 19 subcontractors employing staff in a $200,000 refurbishment of the Kuranda State School.It is not just the economy of places like Cairns that has been affected. We know in rural Victoria, in Shepparton, that youth unemployment is currently at 31.9 per cent. Once again, this would have been made worse without the investments of our stimulus package. The Shepparton News reports that more than $10 million of projects started at schools in Greater Shepparton and $32.4 million of new housing approvals have started over the past three months. Greater Shepparton City Council business manager Leanne Mulcahy said the construction boom in Shepparton was 'amazing' and she said:We would attribute a lot of that to the stimulus package and the first home buyers grant.She went on to say that they had done computer modelling on the new construction and that a direct increase of $19 million in construction creates another 50 jobs.During the days of the global recession we believe that the predominant task of this government is to keep Australians working. I understand the opposition do not share that sentiment; consequently they guffaw at these good news stories of people being kept in work. But we believe it is vital that during these days we continue to provide economic stimulus and keep Australians working.</DOC>

 - I always find that it is best if public policy debates are informed by a few facts, and so the Leader of the Opposition perhaps might like to take notice of the following facts. In 2008 there was an 85 per cent increase in the number of Afghan asylum seekers claiming protection in industrialised countries worldwide - a fact the Leader of the Opposition might not like to acknowledge, but a fact nevertheless: an 85 per cent increase in the number of Afghan asylum seekers. At the same time, Sri Lanka has just emerged from a decades-long civil war which cost tens of thousands of lives, uprooted hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans and left an economic divide between north and south and east and west. -  - I have just heard the opposition interject that the war is over. Perhaps the member who interjected may like to consider this very sobering and tragic statistic. There are currently 250,000 Tamils from the north of Sri Lanka in camps for internally displaced people. The Tamil community in Sri Lanka feels marginalised and the hard work of postwar political reconciliation lies ahead. We understand that Sri Lanka faces an immense challenge in dealing with the legacy of this very bitter conflict. These are factors motivating people to seek to leave Sri Lanka, sometimes illegally.On the question of the pull factors that the Leader of the Opposition referred to, these are the accurate statistics on the push factors - the things that are getting people to start moving. On an analysis of the pull factors, perhaps I can refer him to an article in the Sunday Age, by the member for Kooyong, entitled 'Razor wire returns'. I have to say that I do not often agree with the member for Kooyong. In the time I have been in this place, since 1998, we have had some spectacular disagreements on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and on other matters. But I refer the Leader of the Opposition to this article and I would ask him to reflect on it before he makes further statements about the question of asylum seeking. The member for Kooyong said:Did refusing to give permanent protection to people found to be genuine refugees deter? Again, no. In the five years before the introduction of temporary protection visas, there were 3,103 boat arrivals. In the five years after, boat arrivals increased to more than 11,000. Did the coalition government's eventually giving the overwhelming majority of temporary protection visa-holders permanent protection lead to a surge of refugees? No.I refer the Leader of the Opposition to those words. They might help him answer the question he has asked.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. Last week we received further encouraging news that business and consumer confidence remain strong in the Australian economy. The NAB business survey showed that confidence among Australian businesses remains at levels not seen since 2007. The construction industry was one of the most confident, which reflected the government's infrastructure stimulus.Consumer confidence has rebounded strongly over recent months, and that is very encouraging as well. The Sensis consumer survey released last week showed that consumer confidence rose 13 percentage points in the September quarter. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment rose to its highest level since June 2007. That means consumer confidence in Australia is now almost 50 per cent higher than the pre-stimulus levels of October last year. This compares very favourably to what is occurring internationally. For example, the rebound in consumer confidence in Australia is something like more than double the improvement seen in the UK and the US. It is noted in the Reserve Bank minutes published today that confidence in Australia has held up better and recovered more strongly than elsewhere in the world. This reflects the fact that the stimulus has kept customers going through the door and more Australians in work. That is what has provided this vital boost to confidence.The fact that Australia grew, particularly in the March quarter, gave a very big boost to consumer confidence and business confidence in Australia because it confirmed that Australia was defying global economic gravity - and that has been very, very important. That has given even further confidence to the Australian people. They can see that, by working together, we can get through the worst global recession in over 75 years. Strong confidence is important. Australians understand that the government is gradually unwinding its stimulus. That is very important to a sustainable recovery in the face of what is still a challenging environment. And you see this reflected in the RBA minutes today. They note that:_ economic prospects for most of the developed world were still uncertain and the possibility of another downturn in some countries could not be ruled out.As the Acting Prime Minister was saying before, that means we must be very cautious as we move forward because there is still an uncertain international environment. The RBA minutes also reflect the approach of the government and the board. The minutes reflect the fact that the board recognises that fiscal stimulus has already peaked and is beginning to taper away. I quote from the minutes again:Staff estimates suggested that the impact of fiscal policy (including payments to households and other ongoing programs) on GDP growth was likely to have peaked in the June quarter and was now gradually declining.This means that monetary policy and fiscal policy are working together and heading in the same direction through the economic recovery. This gives all Australians confidence that we can tackle the challenges ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for her question. However, I am somewhat surprised that she chooses to verbal the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. Last night in estimates, while questioned by Senator Brandis, the commissioner made very clear that he certainly was not going to discuss an internal classified document that goes to operational matters of the Australian Federal Police. Despite the ongoing questioning by Senator Brandis, he made very clear, as is proper, that he would not divulge to the senator, or indeed the Senate committee or indeed ministers of the government, operational matters. I can confirm that the document, entitled Strategic intelligence forecast - transnational criminal trends and threats to Australia, was prepared by the Australian Federal Police on 27 March 2009. As I have said, this document is highly classified and disseminated internally within the Australian Federal Police. Commissioner Negus went on to say yesterday that a sanitised version of the document was disseminated externally to a number of Australian government agencies.It is outrageous for the shadow minister for customs, a person who should know better, to verbal the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police on security matters. As is proper, such intelligence documents are produced for operational use by the AFP and are not produced as a basis for policy advice to ministers. They guide the operational decisions of the AFP and its partner agencies. I say further that he did not affirm nor deny any of the comments put to him by Senator Brandis. It would have been improper for him to do so and, therefore, the Australian Federal Police commissioner showed himself to be a professional, unlike the shadow minister for customs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I thank the Leader of the National Party for his interjection. The interjection, for the benefit of members and for the benefit of the Tasmanian Premier, was: 'Somebody's going to build it at last.' He was the minister for transport. For 12 years they sat opposite and they did nothing about the Midlands Highway. We came into office, committed $190 million - $164 million of it to the Brighton bypass, ahead of schedule by six months - and this clown says, 'Somebody's going to build it at last.' Unbelievable. - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. - This project will create up to 380 jobs during construction. We are getting on with the job, thanks to the fact that we have fine representatives from Tasmania - all five of them working in cooperation with the Tasmanian state government.I am asked also about whether there are alternative propositions being put forward, particularly with regard to the Midlands Highway. I, with other cabinet ministers, had the pleasure of being in Tasmania last week. We were there for the community cabinet, consulting with the Tasmanian community. Whilst I was there it was drawn to my attention that the state Liberals have billboards up saying that they would duplicate the entire Midlands Highway. I thought to myself, 'Here they are in here, day after day, and out there Senator Coonan, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer are all saying they would wind back spending.' Remember that? They are going to wind back the stimulus and they are going to wind back infrastructure spending, but out there is a $2 billion commitment.When you look at the detail, there are two caveats on it. One is that they will duplicate the highway where appropriate. We are doing that; we are getting on with that. The second caveat is that the state Liberals will do it subject to federal funding. That is their other caveat. So they got the Leader of the National Party to travel down to Tasmania on Saturday to back up this strong commitment by the state Liberals. In a moment of honest self-analysis, the Leader of the National Party said this: 'Anyone who has driven the road would know that it needs upgrading now.' This person, who was, of course, the transport minister in the former government, knows now that this road needs to be upgraded. What is their profile of spending on this commitment? The first thing he said was: 'If we are elected next time, we will then give a commitment of $400 million to fix this project that would cost at least $2 billion.'But it gets worse, because he said that it needed to be fixed now but that it would be delivered in the period between 2014-15 to 2024-25. So there is an optimist for you. They can be held to this commitment if they win the election in 2010 - and that is going well! If they win in 2013, if they win in 2016, if they win in 2019 and if they win in 2022, they can be held to account for this commitment of $400 million - for 20 per cent of the $2 billion. We do not know where the other $1.6 billion is coming from.This is a farce. On this side of the parliament we are getting on with the job, in cooperation with the Tasmanian government, of fixing the Midlands Highway right now. We are getting on with the job as part of the $800 million. Three times what those opposite put into infrastructure in road and rail over a similar period we are putting into Tasmania through the Nation Building Program. I look forward to continuing to work with Premier Bartlett on this project. And I ask the opposition: please, get serious.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. The answer is none. Matters of policy for government are decided by the government. In deciding our border protection policies, what we determined to do was to be tough on border protection but to deal with people in a humane way. In putting that balance together, we have been very, very focused on dealing with people-smuggling. And, of course, as we deal with people-smuggling, we note that, despite the claims of the opposition to the contrary, the numbers of people moving around the globe have increased. The numbers of asylum seekers have increased. - I see the shadow minister shaking her head, so I am going to take her to some basic facts. According to the UNHCR, at the end of 2008 -  - It will take finer minds than mine to work out whether that is the worst performance the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has ever had, or whether the Keating quote was the worst performance the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has ever had. I will leave it to finer minds than mine to try and work out which was the silliest question. Once again, it may be a heroic assumption in relation to members of the opposition, but I am assuming that in one of these public policy debates of our time - namely, how the world deals with unauthorised people movement - people in the opposition will be interested in the facts. I am constantly being proved wrong, question by question, interjection by interjection -  - And I am told, 'That's right.' In a triumph of hope over experience, I am going to try and inject some facts into this debate in the hope that maybe the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others might grapple with the facts as they engage in the public debate about asylum seeking and people movement. Fact No. 1 in dealing with the question of how many people are moving around our globe: the UNHCR tells us that, at the end of 2008, the total number of refugees and internally displaced people under its care remains high at roughly 25 million - almost unchanged since 2007. So some sense that there has been a big drop-off is not right. Fact No. 2 - and here we go, of course facts do not want to impinge on the opposition's views -  - Fact No. 2 - and I will conclude on this, because I think it is important - is that the government has adopted an approach which is tough on boarder protection but humane to asylum seekers. On the question of protecting our borders -  -  - I know that these facts might not suit the opposition, who are catcalling now. On the question of the facts, since September 2008, 82 disruptions of planned smuggling ventures to Australia by Indonesian national police, involving around 1,497 persons, have occurred. That is 82 disruptions. Since September 2008, the AFP has charged 48 people with people-smuggling offences under the Migration Act. We are aware of the detention by the Indonesian navy of the person known as Captain Bram, who was involved in people-smuggling. This is evidence that the government is pursuing tough policies to protect our borders, whilst dealing with the question of asylum seekers in a humane fashion.</DOC>

 - It is fair to say that, so far, Australia has withstood the global financial crisis better than any comparable nation, but there is more to do to make sure that we capitalise on the opportunities provided by our comparative strengths and also to ensure that we continue to outperform the rest of the world. A robust financial services sector is important to that agenda. It is important to ensure that we continue to capitalise on the opportunities available so that we have well-paying, highly skilled jobs in the financial services sector and export more of Australia's financial services, which are so important to our economic performance.The World Economic Forum last week released its Financial development report 2009, which gave a significant endorsement of the maturity of Australia's financial markets. I am very pleased to report to the House that that report marked Australia as second in the world - ahead of the United States, ahead of Hong Kong and Singapore and ahead of many of our competitors - for the maturity of our financial services sector. Importantly, in this very tumultuous time, Australia was the only country in the top 10 to have improved its performance over the last 12 months. The stability of our financial sector has been very important in this result. Australia's financial services sector has been building on its strengths, building on the quality of our prudential regulation and building on its very good track record. It has been further supported by the strength of the real economy. It has been further supported by the fact that Australia is the only nation among the nations with which we normally compare ourselves which has not gone into a technical recession. - The member for Dickson! The member for Dickson could not even organise a successful surrender of his own seat and he is giving us advice. We have all heard of Pyrrhic victories. He had a Pyrrhic surrender - 'the member for to be advised' interjects. - Paul Keating never ran away from a fight. - Also important has been the Australian government's response in instituting the wholesale and retail banking guarantee to ensure the stability of Australia's financial services sector. As well as being ranked second overall, Australia was ranked first in the world for low risk of sovereign debt crisis, a very important finding , which belies some of the outlandish and opportunistic claims we have heard about the level of Australia's government debt - first in the world for low risk of sovereign debt crisis. As I say, Australia was the only financial sector in the top 10 over the last 12 months to improve its performance. But there is still a lot more left to do.We need to make sure that Australia does not squander these opportunities. We need to make sure that we build on the opportunities. For some time the world's investors will be looking to see who got through this crisis the best. The world's investors will be looking for a safe harbour where prudential regulation is respected and where the financial services and real economy have done well. We will be making a case that Australia is that nation. That is why we have been taking policy initiatives like reducing our withholding tax from the highest rate in the world to effectively the lowest, to rewriting our tax treatment of managed investment funds and to doing all the other things that needed to have been done over the last decade and a half but which were not done. We will continue to do those things.Soon we will be receiving the Johnson report, which was instigated by the government last year to recommend the next steps to build on the work we have already done. While some in the House may contend that the hard work is all done, while some in the House may contend that it is time to withdraw stimulus and to leave the financial sector on its own, and to leave the economy on its own, we say there is more work to be done. We will not miss opportunities to create jobs. We will not miss the opportunities to build a financial services sector in Australia which exports more and creates better, well-paying jobs for Australians. We will not miss the opportunities because that is what the Australian people expect of us.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for her question. I presume that at the bottom of all of this is the opposition's view that it is going to land a major political blow if somehow it can suggest it agrees with me. It is a very unusual thing for an opposition to seek to get political advantage by agreeing with the Deputy Prime Minister of the alternative political party and the government. But such is the convoluted logic the opposition has got itself into in these desperate days. I thank the shadow minister for watching the Laurie Oakes interview on Sunday. I am sure he is very grateful for her coming up in the viewer attendance numbers as well.I say to the shadow minister that one of the things that have been debated during this nation's various debates about asylum seeking and refugees is how you deal with the push factors that get people on the move and what one should do in relation to domestic policy settings. I say to the shadow minister - and I take her again to some inconvenient facts for her but things I think she should be recognising in this debate - that statistics from the UNHCR about the number of people on the move and the number of people looking for asylum -  - I know that as soon as I say the word 'fact' someone from the opposition - Pavlov's dog style - needs to move a point of order because they do not want people to know the facts of this debate. The UNHCR facts are as follows: asylum seeker applications have increased by 28 per cent and the number of refugees returning home voluntarily decreased by 17 per cent compared to the previous year. Clearly, from those UNHCR statistics push factors are on the rise. On the question of assessing domestic policy settings and the implications of those domestic policy settings on the number of arrivals, I refer her to the analysis of her own colleague the member for Kooyong. Maybe when question time is at its conclusion she can go and have a cup of tea with him and talk this through with him in detail. But I think the shadow minister would have to acknowledge, in the words of the member for Kooyong:In the five years before the introduction of temporary protection visas, there were 3,103 boat arrivals. In the five years after, boat arrivals increased to more than 11,000.How does the shadow minister put the case that this government's moving away from the TPV system has made a difference to boat arrivals when those statistics tell a story that is the complete reverse. What I would like the shadow minister to acknowledge - what her colleague the member for Kooyong acknowledges and what the UNHCR is chronicling for us - is that there are factors that get people on the move. The significant factor in our region at the moment is the aftermath of the civil war in Sri Lanka and no amount of manipulation of the truth by the shadow minister or the Leader of the Opposition is going to wish that fact away.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question because climate change is one of the most significant economic challenges that the nation faces and the introduction of the CPRS is one of the most significant structural changes that we have seen in this country since the reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments in the early 1980s and 1990s. That means that we need informed debate and informed discussion and it also means we need timely action, because this has been talked about for a long time. The government has been working on its proposals for a CPRS since the very beginning of this government.Early passage of the CPRS is necessary and it is most particularly necessary to give business the investment certainty that it craves and needs to support jobs in our economy in the years ahead. This is the view of the business community. I quote from the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, which had this to say a month or so ago;The passage of legislation _ will provide a clear signal and measure of certainty around which long-term institutional investors like super funds can begin to base investment planning and decisions.This view is shared widely across the business community and that is why we do welcome the engagement from the opposition, at last, this week. We are very serious about considering these proposals. In responding to their proposals we will be guided by the national interest, which means that any of the amendments they put forward must be economically responsible and they must, of course, also be environmentally credible. Economic responsibility is crucial. It is crucial because as we move through this transition in Australian industry and jobs we have to be acutely aware of the need for medium-term fiscal sustainability. The 2009-10 budget presented projections of the underlying cash balance and net debt position out to 2019-20. Estimates are there of revenue and spending under the CPRS. They were all accounted for in those projections. This means that any additional spending which will increase projected deficits and increase net debt will have to be met by offsets or savings elsewhere.I think the opposition have confirmed overnight that they have calculated the economic costs and the emissions effect of the amendments. We look forward to seeing all of that detail from the shadow minister as part of the negotiations. We do want a sensible discussion about costs and benefits and we do want that within a sensible time frame, because we need to have this voted on this year. The House will have plenty of time and the Senate will have plenty of time, because the passage of the CPRS by the end of the year must provide the investment certainty that business has been looking for for such a long period of time. We need those investments now. We need them to support the green jobs of the future and we need to process, deliberate and act on this important issue this year.</DOC>

 - Well, talk about verballing the Reserve Bank board and their minutes! There they go again. They cannot stand the fact that the stimulus was successful. They cannot stand the fact that the stewardship of this government during a period of grave threat to this country was successful. They simply cannot stand it so they will stretch any fact. They will distort any quote from anybody anytime to completely and inaccurately portray the position of both the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the minutes.Government members - Tender? -  -  - The Reserve Bank and the governor - in their minutes today - are saying nothing different from what they have consistently said for a long period of time, and that is that interest rates, at their 50-year emergency lows, could not stay there forever. Those opposite have been running around the country trying to pretend that somehow they could and that there would not be a withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus by the Reserve Bank at any time in the future. They hate the fact that our economy has begun to grow. They simply dislike that because the one thing that they wanted, when they came into this parliament in February this year and voted against our Nation Building and Jobs Plan, was higher unemployment and they wanted it for base political purposes. They therefore resent the fact that our fiscal stimulus, working hand in glove with the monetary policy stimulus from the Reserve Bank, has produced one of the most outstanding results in the world. That is what they resent, and therefore they then go on to perpetrate a fiction that there is somehow some conflict between the Reserve Bank governor and the board and their minutes with government policy. There is nothing in these minutes that says anything other than the Reserve Bank is beginning to unwind monetary policy stimulus because the economy is beginning to grow. It is that simple. Of course fiscal policy and monetary policy are both working together. And the other thing that they refuse to admit is the fact that fiscal policy reached its peak in June this year and it will subtract from growth in every quarter of next year. But the reason they will not admit that is that they have got a policy of withdrawing stimulus -  - The Reserve Bank board minutes do not say that the fiscal policy of the government is imprudent. In trying to perpetrate that, he was continuing the lie in this parliament that somehow there was an impact -  - The Leader of the Opposition was talking about the Reserve Bank board minutes. I would like to quote from those minutes to conclude my answer, Mr Speaker. The board observes that stimulus has already peaked and is tapering away, and it says this:Staff estimates suggested that the impact of fiscal policy (including payments to households and other ongoing programs) on GDP growth was likely to have peaked in the June quarter and was now gradually declining.This should be read in the context of statements that the Reserve Bank governor gave when he attended the Senate inquiry last month. He was talking about the inbuilt withdrawal of the stimulus when he had this to say:Such an outcome would mean that fiscal and monetary policy would be acting broadly consistently, as they did when they were moved in the expansionary direction when the economy was slowing.So the fact is the RBA is withdrawing monetary policy stimulus, the government is withdrawing fiscal policy stimulus; and both are working together.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for the question. Representing the area of Far North Queensland, he knows very well the threat that climate change represents to great environmental icons like the Great Barrier Reef. Of course, it is to meet that environmental threat that the government is proposing to make this major environmental and economic reform, because the scientific consensus is very clear and that is that the impact of unabated climate change will be significant and costly to many countries and in particular this country.The global community is meeting in Copenhagen in December to address this issue. That is less than 50 days away and the government has committed Australia to playing its part constructively in an endeavour to achieve an international agreement. As the member for Warringah opined yesterday in the opinion pages of the Australian, passing the CPRS before Copenhagen will assist the international negotiations. The CPRS will enable Australia to meet its emission reduction targets in the most economically efficient way. It is important that we pass the CPRS, as the Treasurer was indicating to the House earlier, not only to start reducing our greenhouse gas emissions but also to begin the transformation of our economy and to provide the certainty that is needed for the business community to go on and invest.As I indicated yesterday, the government welcomes the opposition's proposals, and we certainly look forward to seeing detailed written amendments and costings in the very near future. The government is committed to negotiating in good faith with the opposition in relation to these issues. The government's job in these discussions is to ensure that the scheme will still add up - that is, that it tackles climate change effectively at the lowest cost to our economy, that it is environmentally credible and that it is fiscally responsible. Therefore, it is critical that the coalition's proposals meet both of those criteria also - fiscal responsibility and environmental credibility.Whilst the opposition have stated that their proposals will be cost neutral and capable of achieving the same level of emissions reductions as the CPRS, we need to see the detail. Proposals to exclude sectors or to provide additional support to particular industries potentially impose significant additional costs. They need to be balanced with the need to ensure environmental credibility and the fiscal integrity of the scheme. The government remains absolutely committed to passing this important legislation. There are, therefore, three important criteria by which the government will approach these negotiations and assess the proposals of the coalition. They are, as I have emphasised, that the proposals are environmentally credible, that they are fiscally responsible and also that the coalition commit to voting on the timetable that we set on this legislation this year in advance of the Copenhagen conference. These will be the fundamental criteria by which the government approaches these important negotiations.</DOC>

 - Of course, the question is based on a fundamental miscalculation, a fundamental misrepresentation and a fundamental lack of judgement by all of those opposite. The fact is that both fiscal policy and monetary policy are both working and going in the same direction, just as they did when we were responding to the crisis. As the economy has begun to grow, monetary policy is gradually going to be withdrawn. - Is it the shadow minister's proposition that interest rates at 50-year lows could remain there forever? Is that the proposition he is putting forward - yes or no? I think the Australian people have a lot more common sense when it comes to this issue than those who are sitting opposite. They understand. They understand that interest rates could not stay at 50-year lows forever. They absolutely understand that. They understand that adjustments will be made. They also understand that the government put in place our economic stimulus at a time when this country was in dire need and under threat from a global financial crisis and a global recession. The consequence of that has been the best performance of any advanced economy.That is really what gets up their nose - that in this situation the government has been effective, the government has been competent and the government has put to the forefront of all of its actions protecting the jobs, the families and the small businesses of this country. To score a political point, because they voted against that and they have been embarrassed about it, they are now calling for the complete withdrawal of all fiscal stimulus. That is the proposition that they have been putting forward, which would push unemployment back through the roof. If he really believes what he said, he is really saying that he is in favour of putting builders and tradies out of work. That is where they are. - The economic stimulus that we put in place, responsibly, had its peak impact in the June quarter of this year. In each quarter after June it is withdrawn. For every quarter of next year it will subtract from growth. So the economic stimulus is being withdrawn. It was designed to have its maximum impact at the time that it was really required, in our hour of need, and of course that was in February this year, when those opposite walked into the parliament and voted against the Nation Building and Jobs Plan - one of the most effective economic stimuluses put in place by any government anywhere in the world. Following the advice of the International Monetary Fund and others, we said it would be timely, temporary and targeted. We designed it to be gradually withdrawn so that, as the private sector gradually recovered, the public sector would gradually withdraw. - That is how it has been done and how it has been designed. The shadow minister just interjected. I want every builder in the country to know what he just said: 'We're crowding them out.' That is what he said. He is pretending there is no spare capacity in Australia's construction industry. This is unbelievable. How out of touch are this mob? How out of touch is their housing minister, who is in here pretending there is no spare capacity in the Australian construction industry? How out of touch can they all be? They simply do not walk in the same shopping aisles as the average Australian.We understand that there is a need to continue to provide some support because there is spare capacity in the Australian economy and because unemployment will continue to rise. We understand that many people out there, although employed, are working far fewer hours than they would like to work. In fact, all of those reduced hours add up to something like 200,000 full-time jobs, over and above the increase in unemployment that has occurred in this country that the Acting Prime Minister was talking about earlier. So there is still substantial spare capacity in the Australian economy, which is why it does require support. But it is also why, as the private sector growth returns, the monetary policy response from the Reserve Bank will be wound down, as indeed our fiscal stimulus was designed to be wound down. But the opposition want to continue a fiction which no-one else in Australia believes. It demonstrates just how incompetent and how unfit for government they are that they could walk into this House and claim that interest rates could stay at 50-year lows forever and pretend that they are not four per cent below the peak that they were only a short time ago - which has of course been of enormous benefit to an enormous number of people in this community.What we have to do is sensibly manage the recovery, and that is what we are doing. That is why we designed the economic stimulus, the fiscal stimulus, the way we did: to support Australian families, to support employment and to support vulnerable sectors of the economy until private demand returned. The Acting Prime Minister before referred to the fact that the outlook internationally is uncertain, so in the middle of this we have to be very careful in the way in which we manage the recovery, in the way in which we withdraw our stimulus and in the way in which we continue to support the economy. The livelihoods of tens of thousands of families and businesses depend upon it. It is a pity that those opposite do not realise that.</DOC>

It is the case that there are significant opportunities in growing clean energy jobs and securing a low-carbon future for Australia, and this is a very important time for Australia to take those opportunities. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will play a central role in unlocking these opportunities for clean energy jobs and for industries. It will provide certainty for business, accelerating the competitiveness of clean energy technologies - and that is quite critical at this time, when we want to address dangerous climate change.Alongside the CPRS the government is bringing forward comprehensive programs to improve Australia's energy efficiency, growing clean energy jobs for the future, including through the Energy Efficient Homes Package, which has provided insulation or solar hot water for more than 500,000 Australian households since February this year. That is right: more than 500,000 Australian households since February this year. This compares to around 4,000 solar hot water rebate applications received over the time of the previous government - and they did nothing on insulation. So we have more than half a million households in eight months, compared to 4,000 households in 12 years. And this is about creating jobs. The Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand, ICANZ, originally estimated that around 4,000 jobs would be created as a direct result of the insulation program. The council then went on to double that estimate. They now advise my department that even that doubled figure may be conservative, as many more jobs are being created.Through the Solar Homes and Communities Plan we are on track to help over 120,000 homes install solar systems since November 2007. Again, that compares, in the life of the former government, to around 10,500 solar panels funded over some 12 years. I think the figures are telling the story. But, importantly, I am advised that there are already around 500 additional solar panel installers in training to meet this unprecedented workload, with around 75 new installers becoming accredited each month. This comes on top of the government's solar credit scheme, part of the expanded renewable energy target. Industry estimates that that target will drive around $20 billion of investment in renewable energy technologies: clean energy jobs, delivered by the Rudd government - jobs in insulation, jobs in solar hot water, jobs in solar panels, jobs in large-scale renewables.I cannot help but notice that not everyone in the parliament is interested in the task of supporting clean energy technologies and Australian jobs. The member for Tangney has been interjecting ever since I got to my feet. So I was glad that I glanced at the report of a speech from the member for Tangney to a group of climate change sceptics. He was not speaking to the opposition backbench, although there are climate change sceptics there. I am always interested to see what the member has to say. I know the Leader of the Opposition would be interested in this as well, because this is where the intellectual driving force of the Liberal Party on climate change policy is coming from. According to the report the member for Tangney believes that action on climate change is an attempt to overthrow democracy! This is what he said -  - The member is still interjecting. I want to read his quote out:We have observed anti-democratic comments from many so-called environmentalists calling for the overthrow of democracy and/or capitalism to save the planet.This is the public policy rigour of the Liberal and National parties, when we are at the threshold of one of the most important debates that this country has ever had. He talks about the overthrow of capitalism. Regrettably, it is the overthrow of reason that is the problem we face here. I suspect the member for Tangney calling it the 'overthrow of capitalism' would surprise the many hardworking Australian families who are now in the process of wanting to build clean energy industries with the assistance of the Rudd government's programs - that is, the tradies, the truck drivers, those people along the supply chain and the many, many clean energy jobs that the government are actually delivering with our programs. As for the overthrow of democracy that the member refers to, I can only think of all those Australians who voted in November 2007 to bring an end to 12 years of denial and climate change scepticism on the part of the Liberal-National Party, now led by the Leader of the Opposition, and to provide a clear message from the Australian public that they wanted a government that was going to be serious about tackling climate change and about bringing forward the benefits and the fruits of employment to the Australian economy that our policies are already delivering.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I would say that with the guidelines and the timelines that have been set out by the government there is an expectation that that can be completed by all those parties in a manner that is appropriate to the policy delivery that we have sought on this issue. I know that the minister responsible has been particularly assiduous in wanting to drive reform, after a 12-year of hiatus of reform on the question of water delivery in the Murray-Darling Basin, right through to where we are actually concerned about not only providing reform but also enabling the very significant challenges that we face - the challenges of drought and the challenges of water shortage and the like - to be resolved.It is important to note that the minister has made it clear that she is frustrated with some of the pace of reform. There is no secret about that. Also, she has made it clear that she is frustrated with some of the pace of the reform that is taking place within the state jurisdictions. You are quoting a CEO from a state body, but I think it is important for me to put that on the record. The most important thing that the minister has said is that she is concerned about roadblocks and about impediments and delays. I do not think she wants to delay the reform process any longer. In fact, I know that she does not.I will just make the House aware that, jointly with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, that department is now conducting an audit into the status of a number of projects across the basin. At the end of the day, though, I think it is worth while saying this through you, Mr Speaker, to the people of Australia as well as to the opposition: this is clearly a difficult issue that will require a fair amount of application by us to ensure that the right policy measures are in place. We cannot make it rain, although I was pleased to see Wimmera farmers are responding to the fact that they think they have got some opportunities for their crops because we have seen some decent winter rains. But at the end of the day we are committed to reform. We want to see that reform through and we will not resile from that path.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question and all of her hard work on behalf of carers in her electorate. The member for Robertson is right: this week is Carers Week and it is an opportunity for all of us - in fact, an opportunity for all Australians - to take time to recognise and thank the hundreds of thousands of carers right across Australia who do such a wonderful job caring for people they love, whether it is mums and dads, sons and daughters or grandparents. These are the many, many people who do such an extraordinary job and for many of them it is a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day job. All of us know that this takes a very significant toll on carers - emotionally and financially and, often, there is a significant physical toll as well.We as a government have made carers a priority. Just yesterday at the launch of Carers Week I announced that the government does intend to introduce a national carers recognition framework. This is something that carers have been calling for for some time. The framework will recognise in legislation the role played by carers. One of the very important things is that it makes sure that all of us understand and recognise through national legislation the commitment and dedication of so many people who do care in so many different circumstances.It is important for us to recognise that we have made clear that we understand the need for financial support as well. As part of our major program of reform of the pension we have just delivered a very significant increase in the carer payment, and that has increased support to more than 140,000 carers across the country who are on the carer payment. Those carers who are on the maximum rate of the carer payment - those who are on the single rate - will receive increases of just over $70 a fortnight. That is a very significant improvement for those carers who are on the maximum rate of the single carer payment. In addition we have introduced for the first time an ongoing carer supplement so that carers, whether they are on the carer payment or on the carer allowance, can know with certainty that each year they will get a $600 payment for each of the people they care for.I have had a number of letters from carers indicating how important these measures have been for them. To quote one carer indicating to me how important it is, she said in her letter:Both the gesture and the dollars have been a big help to them meeting their ongoing expenses.Finally, I would draw the attention of the House to the very significant changes we have made to carer payment (child). This is a payment made to carers who are looking after severely disabled children or children with serious medical conditions. Up until 1 July the rules for carer payment (child) were extremely complicated and restrictive. As a result of these changes we expect that around 19,000 extra carers of severely disabled children will now be eligible for carer payment (child). These are very significant changes that the government has made. We will continue to work hard with those who represent carers to do everything we can to support people who are doing such a wonderful job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question because it provides an opportunity to outline the specific circumstances of this particular issue. At the outset, I make absolutely clear the government's commitment to ensuring that our service personnel and their families receive their correct entitlements. The Air Force is currently undertaking the development of a new capability, which is known as the special tactics flight, within No. 4 Squadron based at RAAF Base Williamtown. This involves Air Force personnel who undertake specific training to enable them to undertake a range of activities, including operations with special forces. However, the members of No. 4 Squadron are not special forces personnel. When they are deployed on operations or conducting associated training they have an entitlement to a component of the special forces disability allowance. This allowance is paid in recognition of the hazard and stress associated with service within the special forces environment that they of course experience.I am advised that in April this year, not June as I think the member for Paterson indicated, a directive from the Chief of the Defence Force created eligibility for this allowance to these members and indicated that the allowance would be paid on an occurrence basis - that is, when the capability is in use or when people are in training or in operations, rather than as a continuous payment. At the same time, the CDF also approved the back pay of this entitlement for those deployed or trained prior to April 2009 when eligibility for the allowance was created. The training began in 2007. When transactions related to this allowance, after its generation in April, were loaded onto the pay system at the end of September 2009, I am advised that they were incorrectly loaded at a continuous rate. The member for Paterson then left the chamber. 
 - I understand that the Air Force, upon the loading of this data onto the pay system, immediately recognised - this occurred in September - that the continuous rate for this allowance did not accord with the original directive from the Chief of the Defence Force and therefore they stopped the payment. The suspension of the payment was designed to ensure that the special forces disability allowances were not paid in error, which would have led to the need to recover any overpayments. I am further advised that the Air Force is currently in the process of developing the correct business rules for the payment of the allowance and ensuring that all affected members are paid their correct entitlements. I am advised that currently 18 members of No. 4 Squadron are entitled to receive a component of this allowance through their training and/or their operational activity. Today, I have written to the Acting Chief of the Defence Force to urge urgent resolution of this issue. Finally, could I remark that the first that the government was aware of this issue was yesterday and we have taken immediate action to ensure that the circumstances of the particular service personnel are appropriately investigated by the ADF and that their correct entitlements are paid as soon as possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The Rudd government is serious about reforming our health, hospital and aged-care systems. In fact, only three months ago we released the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report and since that time the Prime Minister, the health minister, the Minister for Indigenous Health, the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and I have been travelling around the country road testing the 123 recommendations for reform that were in the commission's report. In fact, last Friday's consultation in Alice Springs by Minister Snowdon was the government's 60th consultation. That is one consultation every 1½ days. We are listening to people at the coalface to get their views. More than 4,500 people have attended these consultations and the feedback has been very positive. In fact, aged-care providers have been actively engaged in the process, recognising the need to build an integrated health and aged-care system that meets the needs of our ageing population.This government has already taken very concrete steps to meet the challenges of an ageing population. We have provided more funding for aged-care services than any previous Australian government, increasing funding to the sector by an average of nine per cent a year. We have rolled out transition care places to support older people recovering and regaining their independence, keeping them out of hospitals and keeping them out of early entry into nursing homes. We have also invested in our aged-care workforce to improve the quality of care today and for the future, and we are making more information available for consumers, particularly about the performance of individual aged-care facilities. Very importantly, we have taken a very tough stand to protect our older Australians.Australians now have one of the longest life expectancies in the English-speaking world and, of course, with increased longevity more people are living with multiple, complex and chronic conditions. The ageing of the population presents substantial challenges that this government is working hard to meet. Under the previous government, Australians had a decade of neglect in the health and aged-care sector. In contrast, we have a blueprint for reform and we are out there consulting with the community and discussing that with them. We stand on the cusp of the most significant reform to our health system since the introduction of Medicare 25 years ago, and I urge the opposition to support it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. There has been some particularly good news in Ballarat which I will come to in a moment, but the most recent government announcement for the newest GP superclinic was in Gunnedah in New South Wales, bringing the total number of superclinics funded by the Rudd government to 36. As the member for Parkes has welcomed, funding of $4.3 million will now go towards the construction of a new facility, the Gunnedah Rural Health Centre, on the grounds of the hospital. The announcement has been met with delight by the local community, including, as I acknowledged, the member for Parkes. He called it 'a great day for the people of Gunnedah, an exciting model and a long-held dream'.I welcome those comments and welcome the recognition from some of those opposite that the GP superclinic strategy is delivering and will deliver to local communities. I just wonder whether the shadow minister for health is changing his view and will now support the superclinic strategy. It is a little bit difficult to tell when we do not know what his health policy is or whether he actually cares about the superclinic in his electorate. He did not bother to turn up to the sod turning for the Strathpine superclinic in Dickson. It must have been that he already knew he was moving to McPherson at that time.Let me come back to the member for Ballarat because I was delighted last month to join her and officially open the first fully operational GP superclinic in Ballan. For this superclinic, which is really something worth this House taking note of, $1.4 million was provided by the government but the remaining $0.9 million that made up this $2.3 million project was actually raised by funds from the community. I think we should congratulate the community of Ballan for their contribution. The service is going to provide GPs, practice nurses, visiting specialists, allied health services, chronic disease management and - I think of interest to all in this House - for the first time in Ballan, a dental service. For the first time ever, a dentist will be working in Ballan, in the superclinic, courtesy of this funding arrangement.Twenty-six GP superclinic contracts are now signed. In addition to the one in Ballan, five other services are providing interim services. For example I can advise, and I know the member for Dobell has particularly welcomed this, that the Warnervale clinic has started to provide GP services last week for the first time at its interim site. Podiatry, a diabetes educator, an exercise physiologist and pharmacy services are expected to start soon. Given that the member for Dickson was not prepared to turn up to the sod turning for his superclinic in Strathpine, I presume he will not be around for the ribbon-cutting ceremony because, of course, he checked out of Dickson months ago. - Interestingly, a member for the Gold Coast is asking when there will be a superclinic on the Gold Coast. - The shadow minister was trying to move to the Gold Coast, but he was rejected in McPherson. He is not wanted in Wright. He cannot decide if he is going to run in Dickson. - I am responding to the part of the question which deals with the community's response. One might expect that the shadow health minister might have a view about GP superclinics, not just as the national spokesperson for the Liberal Party but as a local member who has a GP superclinic being constructed in his electorate. He was not prepared to turn up to the opening ceremony and has not had any interest in the many jobs that are being provided on site. I did notice, though, that he declared the day after the McPherson preselection that he would not give up - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am reminded of a question that was asked earlier by the member for Hinkler about a matter relating to the insulation program, where we learned - regarding the company responsible for that particular matter - that in fact the points that had been put by way of questions in the House were not an accurate reflection of the views that the general manager put to me. I also reflect that it was this honourable member who jumped out of a plane without a parachute to tell us that solar panel installations were in freefall - this is what we say - when in fact they were at all-time record highs. What I would say to the honourable member is that it is the expectation of the government that installers will ensure that they follow the guidelines that have been laid out for ceiling insulation. I do say to people that they should take the opportunity to get at least two quotes, if not more, in order to assess the quotation that has been given to them. I also say to the honourable member that we have an extensively delivered compliance and auditing program. He knows that himself because only a couple of weeks ago he was calling on the Auditor-General to provide some auditing, and he knows that the Auditor-General has communicated the fact that the existing audit provisions and plans that are contemplated for this program are sufficient for this point in time, and -  -  - No - I am happy to speak about it even further. - The shadow minister, the member for Flinders, was calling on the Auditor-General to take a specific action, which the Auditor-General deemed was not necessary - he has communicated that to me -  - on the basis that the government takes the effective delivery of this program very seriously. We have a number of measures in place, including compliance and auditing measures. We have PricewaterhouseCoopers now involved in making sure that those compliance and auditing measures are done at a national level and at national scale. It is the case that some ceiling insulations will cost at least $1,600 and, in some instances, even more. But the fact is that, since February, this has been the most comprehensive rollout of an energy efficiency program that we have ever seen in this country. We are delivering the opportunity for families to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and for energy costs to be reduced, and we are employing Australians at the same time. I will make sure that this program continues to deliver the very good benefits that it is bringing to the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question, for reasons which will soon become evident. I launched the Small Business Support Line on 3 September to provide advisory services to small businesses during the global recession. I am pleased to advise the House that, since the support line became operational, 2,226 calls have been received from small businesses. That support line is being staffed by a team of eight advisers, each with extensive small business experience. Yet again, in criticising the support line, the member for Moncrieff has got it wrong. In a press release of 17 August, he claimed that the Small Business Support Line 'will be staffed by bureaucrats and offer none of the tangible help which small businesses need day to day'. I can report that a survey of callers reveals a 90 per cent satisfaction rate with the Small Business Support Line. It is staffed by small business advisers with extensive small business experience, not bureaucrats, and is very, very popular - 90 per cent satisfaction.I am asked about impediments to the support line and the government's effort to support small business. The shadow minister for small business is an impediment to the government's policies. Is it any wonder that, in the list of the Gold Coast's 100 most powerful people, the Gold Coast Bulletin has relegated the member for Moncrieff from 46th last year to 93rd this year? In explaining the member for Moncrieff's demise, the Gold Coast Bulletin says:THE Moncrieff MP has taken several hits this year as the Coalition struggles to keep pace with Prime Minister Kevin Rudd _ He is regularly mocked by the ALP for failing to ask questions in the chamber. - I was asked about impediments to the government's policy and the Gold Coast Bulletin has identified the member for Moncrieff as an impediment. In fact, he is sinking like a stone. I can advise the House that it is now 509 days since the member for Moncrieff last asked me a question. I did thank the member for Forde for his question, and there was an especially good reason for that. I note that the member for Forde is a bullet performer in the top 100 most influential people on the Gold Coast - entering for the first time at 75 and rising fast. Do you know what the Gold Coast Bulletin says about the member for Forde and his commitment to this area? It points out that the member for Forde's office is in Beenleigh. Beenleigh is in Logan City. The Gold Coast Bulletin actually says of him:Despite his federal seat being positioned in Beenleigh, Mr Raguse has managed to successfully lobby Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on the Gold Coast Rapid Transit System and the AFL stadium and secured a community cabinet meeting.So, go the member for Forde! Mr Speaker, this is the only way of getting the member for Moncrieff up to the dispatch box. - We have got something to say about the member for Dickson, because coming in at 77 is another bullet performer - first-timer Karen Andrews, the 49-year-old who emerged from the shadows to beat Liberal Party poster boy Peter Dutton in the McPherson preselection battle. The new likely member for McPherson, Karen Andrews, is said to have more influence on the Gold Coast than the member for Moncrieff. - I am, Mr Speaker. In conclusion: 'Danger, danger, danger, Will Robinson over there.' I am asked what further support the government is providing to small business. Our nation-building infrastructure investment is supporting local tradies and apprentices, and small business is taking up the small business tax break with great gusto. But the global economy remains weak and fragile, and the road to recovery for small business will be a long and bumpy one. The opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition today, persists in calling for the withdrawal of the stimulus and saying, 'Isn't it the case that the current very expansionary setting of fiscal policy is also no longer necessary and possibly imprudent?' There he is - Major Tom in outer space. There he is - right on the outer reaches of the Milky Way.</DOC>

 - The Australian government's mission in Afghanistan is clear-cut. The mission is to train an Afghan national army brigade within the province of Oruzgan in order to provide a basis for security, in time to be transferred to the Afghan National Army to provide security in that province. Secondly, it is also to engage in training support for the Afghan National Police, to assist with civil policing functions within that province as well. Our third mission is to assist within capacity building within the provincial administration of Afghanistan, within the province of Oruzgan, so that that provincial administration can in time also assume responsibility for taking on the civil roles within that part of the country. That is our mission statement.As I have said consistently, Australia's policy in Afghanistan is to be there for the long haul. Our policy is also to be there to realise that mission statement and, once that mission statement is completed, to withdraw our forces - as you would expect.I would also contrast that with the position which was taken on Afghanistan by the previous government. The previous government committed to a military operation in Afghanistan, supported by both sides of the chamber, in 2001 following the terrorist attacks in September of that year. - Senator Faulkner's remarks - that is, those of the defence minister - are entirely consistent with the mission statement that I outlined to the House. It is government policy. And the government's policy stands in stark contrast to the flip, flop, flap that we saw between 2001 and 2005-06 on the part of those opposite when it came to Afghanistan. I notice the member for Eden-Monaro nods his head, in full knowledge of what actually transpired during that period of time. What actually happened during that period of time was that we had an initial Australian military commitment in Afghanistan at the end of 2001 and into 2002, and then mysteriously the Australian Defence Force commitment to Afghanistan reduced to zero. - For the benefit of the member for Sturt, as I said before, the defence minister's statements are entirely consistent with the mission statement of the government, which is of the threefold nature that I described before. We have a mission statement. The previous government did not.Let me return to the policy that we inherited from the previous government on Afghanistan, which was that, after 2001-02, mysteriously in 2003 the Australian Defence Force commitment reduced to zero. When I visited that country myself, I think from memory in 2004, in the company of the member for Bruce, we asked to meet with the representative of the Australian Defence Force in Afghanistan at that time. We were told that he was out of the country. There was one Australian Defence Force liaison officer - am I right, member for Bruce? -  - who was at that stage located in Kabul. And then throughout 2003-04 we had a slow and steady deterioration in the security circumstances within that country. - When the previous government decided to reduce its troop commitment to Afghanistan to zero, in the years 2003-04 and into 2005, it was not to the amusement of our allies. Indeed, the United States and others, I understand, at that time were somewhat concerned at the decision on the part of the Australian government to reduce its troop commitment to zero. So, when it comes to moral lectures on the part of those opposite, in terms of consistency and resolve in our policy and engagement in Afghanistan, I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition reflects long and hard (a) on the previous government's engagement, (b) on the fact that we now have a clear-cut mission statement and (c) that this government is at one with the government of the United States in bringing about the realisation of that mission statement in the province for which we are responsible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question because I know that she, being a Tasmanian member, has a deep commitment to the rollout of this infrastructure in the great state of Tasmania as do, I believe, government members generally with the rollout of this infrastructure across the nation. As I have travelled across Australia, the number of individual communities and businesses that have asked me the simple question, 'When can we get access to high-speed broadband?' has gone through the roof, because this represents a huge new turbocharging opportunity for productivity in the Australian economy and new business opportunities across the nation.The government's plan is clear-cut. That is why we have established the National Broadband Network company to invest up to $43 billion on a high-speed optical fibre broadband network, in partnership with the private sector, with speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. In Tasmania we currently have the lowest proportion of households with access to broadband - 39 per cent compared with the Australian average of 52 per cent. The National Broadband Network will connect 200,000 Tasmanian premises at speeds of 100 megabits per second. This is good news for Tassie. The remainder of the state will be served by the next generation wireless and satellite networks, offering minimum speeds of 12 megabits per second.In July of this year the Tasmanian communities of Smithton, Midway Point and Scottsdale were announced for the stage 1 rollout of the NBN. Construction work for stage 1 is underway and the first services are expected to be available from the middle of 2010 - good news for those communities, good news for Tasmania and good news for Australia.Today I am pleased to inform the House that stage 2 planning for high-speed broadband in Tasmania has commenced. Today, together with Premier David Bartlett, I can also announce seven new regional, urban and outer-urban locations across Tasmania that will be next to receive high-speed optical fibre broadband connections. Work will begin on detailed planning for stage 2, including timeframes, numbers of premises and technical and procurement details for the following communities: Sorell, Deloraine, Georgetown, St Helens, Kingston Beach, South Hobart and others. I am sure the member for Franklin, the member for Denison, the member for Lyons and the member for Bass will be keenly involved and interested in the rollout of these projects. These are good projects for Tasmania; they are good projects for the nation - infrastructure to turbocharge our productivity growth for the 21st century.We recognise that Australia needs a strong telecommunications market that fosters innovation, competition and high customer standards, especially before the NBN is built. But if we are to deal with the 12 years of inaction on telecommunications, we must now confront what constitutes Liberal Party policy today, because what they have indicated today is that they do not want to progress the reform of the telecommunications industry in Australia; they want a recipe for further delay to push this off, somehow, into next year and to ensure that we do not in fact get a resolution of this matter while the parliament sits through to the end of this year.I note that Senator Barnaby Joyce is supporting the government's approach. He said today:_ I'm not convinced we'll listen closely to the argument that structural separation is not a good idea. I strongly believe it's something that we should have done.There you have the Leader of the National Party in the Senate fully supporting the government's policy on strucutral separation of Telstra. What does the Leader of the National Party in the House of Representatives say? What is his policy? 
A government member - Who is he? - It is not just, 'What is his policy?' The question from the backbench on the government side is, 'Who is the Leader of the National Party in this House?' So there we have the coalition once again split right down the middle on the question of a core piece of economic policy for the future of the nation. Senator Minchin has indicated his opposition to the government's approach. If the Liberals had their way, Australians would be left using carrier pigeons for the future rather than accessing an internationally competitive broadband network.The government is getting on with the job. Our policy is clear. After 12 years of neglect on this critical piece of infrastructure those opposite are simply floundering and flailing in the wind looking for a policy. Leadership on this matter is being provided, curiously, by Senator Joyce, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate - leadership having again been abandoned by those representing the National Party and the coalition in the House of Representatives. The government's plan is to build nation-building infrastructure for the future. Jobs today, infrastructure for tomorrow: that is our plan.

 - Suddenly, it seems, the coalition have discovered push factors in asylum seekers. Suddenly, a week and a half into this debate, they have discovered push factors. Why? They spot a sliver of light - a possibility - for getting some political advantage. Except, once again, they have failed to do their homework. The defence minister has consistently argued that Australia must stay the course in order to execute the mission statement which I referred to before. Those opposite now seem to embrace the argument that one of the push factors alive in the asylum seekers debate globally is in fact instability in Afghanistan, and, as a consequence, parallel debates about instability in Sri Lanka. All governments must of course be seized of what is happening within push factors around the world.In a specific reference to Afghanistan, the UN Secretary General stated that in 2008 we saw the ending of the most violent year in Afghanistan since 2001. That is fact No. 1. A further fact relevant to this is that in 2008 there was an 85 per cent increase in the number of Afghan asylum seekers claiming protection in industrialised countries worldwide. Thirdly, between 2005 and 2008 the number of internally displaced persons assisted by the UNHCR in Afghanistan increased from 142,000 to 230,000, an increase of 62 per cent.These are the facts which the global community is dealing with. If you look also at the impact which those numbers have had right across the rest of the world, you will see a parallel impact in terms of the number of Afghan refugee flows across Europe, including the United Kingdom, as in fact has occurred in parallel circumstances to Australia. That is what is called in the debate 'push factors at work'. That is why this government has remained resolute in its commitment to prosecuting the military campaign in Afghanistan. We cannot afford for that country to lurch back into the circumstances that prevailed prior to 2001. We do not want that country to become a training ground for terrorists. We do not, therefore, believe that we should replicate the policy of those opposite between the years 2003 and 2005, which was to abandon the field altogether. Instead, this government's policy has not simply been to continue the troop presence that we inherited from those opposite but to increase the troop presence by 40 per cent in a decision taken by this government earlier this year. The government's mission statement in Afghanistan is clear. It is resolute. We will continue to prosecute that strategy in partnership with our ally the United States of America.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I know that he appreciates the importance of broadband and the government's plan for the National Broadband Network, which is the largest single infrastructure project in Australia's history. The government announced historic reforms to modernise telecommunications regulations in the interests of all Australians. The communications sector and, indeed, the business community know that these reforms are sound, they know they are long overdue, and that is why these reforms were welcomed. They know that the nation requires a quantum leap in both infrastructure and competitive arrangements so that all Australians have high-speed and affordable broadband. But there are some people who are opposed to this plan. Senator Minchin, of course, is opposed to structural separation. However, Senator Joyce, the voice of rationality and reason over there in the Senate, unlike the alternative Deputy Prime Minister of the nation who sits across here unbelievably, is actually supportive of the project and supportive of the reforms that the government has advanced.The coalition may have different views, but the one thing that it appears they can agree on is that they should delay the legislation. Sound familiar - delay the legislation; don't act for 12 years and sit on your hands. When the government proposes reform and action, whether it is on telecommunications regulatory reform, the CPRS or any of the major questions confronting the nation, the coalition vote for delay. They say that the legislation should be put off at least until after the NBN discussions are completed. But the regulatory reforms that we are advancing are critical, irrespective of the NBN. The fact is that the existing regime has failed to deliver the right competitive outcomes for Australian consumers and businesses.Those opposite have been talking up the knowledge on communications in particular of Paul Fletcher, the Liberal candidate for Bradfield. Perhaps they should actually listen to what Paul Fletcher has to say on these issues, because he does know a little bit about communications. He says:The core problem in the Australian broadband market is the flawed market structure, with Telstra hugely dominant.In his recent book Wired Brown Land he gives his assessment of the value of the structural separation of Telstra. He responds to arguments - the same arguments that are being put by people such as Senator Minchin. When Paul Fletcher enters this place Senator Minchin will be his shadow minister for communications. This is what Paul Fletcher says about the arguments against structural separation:In fact, as an argument, it was a dud. It was the old and comprehensively discredited claim that what is good for Telstra is good for Australia. What is good for Australia is a more efficient, competitive and fairly priced broadband market.That is what Mr Fletcher had to say about these issues. I say to those opposite that those keen to hold back these vital and historic reforms have to explain how delay will benefit consumers and our small businesses because these reforms are absolutely critical - they are fundamental. We have made it clear that it is our intention to address the problems with action and the time for action is right now.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question, which goes to the fabric of our cooperation with Indonesia in dealing with the global challenge of people smuggling. I note that that question follows the previous question from the leader of the National Party, which pointed to the push factors which are at work, one of which is from Afghanistan and another of which is from Sri Lanka, given the recent civil war. This government has been absolutely consistent in saying that in dealing with this problem, which is a global problem, we must maximise our global cooperation with the UNHCR and resettlement countries. That is the first part of it.The second part of it, of course, is to employ the cooperative arrangements with Indonesia and other regional countries through the Bali process and also under the provisions which are provided for under the Lombok treaty - which I seem to recall was negotiated by those opposite, though it was ratified and concluded after this government took office. That treaty, in one of its provisions, deals with cooperation between Australia and Indonesia on people-smuggling. The President of Indonesia and I have made no secret of the fact that we intend to continue to develop a framework for further cooperation on people-smuggling. That is what we intend to do. That will mean providing additional assistance to our friends in Indonesia to help with the resettlement task and to help with all the associated functions which they might undertake in the future to assist Australia and other countries in dealing with this regional problem. There is nothing remarkable in that; it is the right thing for Australia to do. This government makes no apology whatsoever for the fact that we have a tough line on asylum seekers when it comes to dealing with the challenges of people smugglers around the world - tough but humane.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. I know only too well from a previous life, as shadow communications minister, how important these issues are in his electorate. The government is committed to building a superfast national broadband network. As part of that commitment, we are also committed to serious regulatory reform in telecommunications to ensure that we create a genuine competitive market to maximise innovation, to maximise choice, to maximise high-quality service and to lower prices for consumers. This program is a fundamentally important microeconomic reform program that is long overdue.The Howard government was obsessed with privatising Telstra and neglected to tackle the industry structure issues that, as the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government just outlined, have been correctly identified by the possibly soon-to-be Liberal member for Bradfield. Under the regime that we inherited from the Howard government, Telstra remains almost two-thirds of the entire telecommunications sector, earning the vast bulk of the profits. The regulatory regime is comprehensively intrusive, burdensome and excessive, and it gives Telstra the incentive to focus much of its energy on 'gaming' the regulation rather than innovating, improving its services or reducing prices. Under the Howard government the biggest growth sector of the Australian economy was telecommunications lawyers, and Telstra were employing a lot of them. That might have been good for the lawyers, and it was not bad for Telstra, but it was terrible for the Australian economy. We ended up way behind comparable countries in broadband, with Telstra with little incentive to innovate, to develop new products, to get new services out to the market or to provide better services or to cut prices.There will be many members in this House who represent small to medium sized towns who will remember that not so long ago, for those towns to have a chance of getting ADSL - the poor person's broadband - at their exchange, they had to gather 150 signatures and present them on bended knee to Telstra, after which maybe Telstra would think about delivering some broadband services to that community.The government is committed to comprehensive reform, to a genuine open market, to serious competition and to enabling innovation for what will be the backbone of Australia's 21st century economy. It is great to see that our old friends in sections of the National Party, led by Senator Joyce, at least understand that, because some of them represent the kinds of rural communities that desperately need high-quality broadband and have little competition, little choice - they get Telstra or nothing. We want to give them a genuine open market, which the opposition used to stand for - a genuine competitive market, where there are incentives to invest, to innovate and to compete, that delivers better outcomes for Australian businesses and consumers.It is understandable that some Telstra shareholders are concerned about the government's plans. But I would say this to those in the investment funds market who are trying to stir up that concern: it is important to look at the total picture. Yes, the loss of Telstra's monopoly dominance does produce some risks and challenges for Telstra. But these changes also involve risks and challenges for other telcos. Also, what the government's plans entail, of course, is a giant leap into a new telecommunications area with government-underwritten infrastructure that will be hugely beneficial to telecommunications providers. And who is the biggest telecommunications provider in Australia? Telstra. So, although they are challenged on one front, they have huge opportunities on the other - just as, if rail infrastructure is upgraded, rail operators benefit. If the government upgrades telecommunications infrastructure, makes that big advance to genuine 21st century broadband, guess who is best positioned to sell more services, to innovate more and to invest more? Telstra is the answer to that question. Telstra shareholders should not accept the line that they are getting from some fund managers. There are huge positive opportunities for Telstra in the government's plans.In the modern economy telecommunications are just as fundamental to economic activity as financial services - just as fundamental. Telstra will continue to be the key player in telecommunications in Australia into the future, but it will be in a genuinely competitive market where the incentives are there for them to innovate, to take risks, to invest, to develop new products and to ensure that Australia can make that giant productivity improvement that we so desperately need for our future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I thought after yesterday's effort she would have realised that there is no way in which this particular classified report would be disclosed publicly. As the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police said two days ago in Senate estimates, there was prepared in March of this year an internal classified report that was provided to people within the Australian Federal Police. He went on to confirm there was a sanitised version that was provided to agencies within this country and some agencies outside of this country. -  - He went on to say - if the opposition just calm down a bit; just relax and we will get to it - in Senate estimates, while being questioned by Senator Brandis, that he confirmed that the intelligence report had never been provided to ministers. Indeed, he stated that the report was an 'operationally focused document' and it would be inappropriate to provide it to ministers. That is already on the record. Unless the shadow minister for justice is seeking to suggest that the Australian Federal Police commissioner would indeed mislead the Senate -  - It is quite remarkable that the shadow minister for justice and customs would indeed challenge the comments made by the Australian Federal Police commissioner. I repeat: the sanitised version, as the commissioner outlined, was provided to agencies inside this country and outside this country. This classified report was not provided to ministers of this government. It would have been improper for him to provide it. I cannot believe that the shadow minister again seeks to verbal the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for putting it beyond doubt that the opposition are living in the past. They are living in the past, particularly about the need for 21st century learning environments and the difference that the Digital Education Revolution and national broadband can make to the learning experiences of Australian students.Whilst the opposition lives in the past, in the last century, the century before or wherever they are marooned today, the government is getting on with the job of delivering 21st century learning environments and 21st century schools to Australian students and teachers. We believe Australian students deserve to learn in the best of facilities. That is why we are investing $16.2 billion in Building the Education Revolution, it is why we are investing $2½ billion dollars in trade training centres and it is also why we are investing $2.2 billion in our Digital Education Revolution to bring computers to schools.I can update the House and provide the following information to date: almost 290,000 additional computers are there and approved for 2,700 secondary schools. Already, 154,000 computers have been delivered to 1,694 schools across Australia. As we continue to fund this program we will reach a one to one ratio of computers to students for students in years nine to 12 of secondary school by the end of 2011 - a promise given in the 2007 election and a promise being delivered.Of course, the Digital Education Revolution, working with the National Broadband Network, will open up a new era of learning for students in Australian schools. It will mean that they are able to source the best of curriculum, content and research material from around the world. It means those students who are in small schools and who perhaps do not have a specialist teacher, perhaps a specialist science teacher or language teacher, will be able to access content and contact with those specialists through the power of the National Broadband Network and our Computers in Schools program. It means, of course, that Australian students will be able to develop the skills that they will need for life and for work in the 21st century.In addition to the support for computers through our Digital Education Revolution, the Australian government is committing $100 million to support the provision of high-speed broadband connections to schools and $80 million for the establishment of a vocational education and training broadband network for technical and further education institutions. Whilst the opposition, like the member for O'Connor, live in the past, we are making sure that Australian children will thrive in the future with the skills they need in this century.</DOC>

We understand that despite the overwhelming evidence in relation to these matters, the reason why there has been an increase in arrivals is because of push factors.

 - We have had yet another example of the inability of any of those opposite to face up to the long-term reforms that are so essential in this country to lift our productivity and to build our prosperity right throughout this century. Nothing is more important than fast national broadband. There has probably been no more debate about any other topic than on this topic, which goes to the core of lifting our productivity. There is an incredible consensus in the business community about the importance of this initiative. It may be that somebody made that comment today. But what I know is that as I move around the business community there is strong support for what the government has put forward. Those opposite put this in the too-hard basket for 12 long years. The consequences have been there for our economy. We are proud of putting forward this bold initiative to lift our productivity and to meet the challenges of the future. - The member knows the answer to that. - We have announced the staging of this proposal and we are putting in place all of those arrangements. He knows that perfectly well. They are so acutely embarrassed by their division on this issue that here they go again with a whole lot of smokescreens. We are serious about this proposal. The investment is being made. The business case is being developed. Australia will be a better place for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for this very important question, because here is yet another example of how this government is prepared to tackle the long-term challenges that we need to tackle to reform our economy and to build prosperity in the 21st century - something that those opposite were incapable of doing when it came to the vital question of tax reform during 12 long years in office. We are all aware that at the height of the mining boom they went on a spending spree and instead of using those valuable resources to invest in fundamental long-term tax reform they simply squandered them. It will fall to this government to put in place a process of long-term tax reform so that we can maximise the opportunities that will surely come to this country as the global economy begins to recover in what is going to be the Asian century.We need fundamental tax reform in this country. The Henry review is the vehicle. This will be the single biggest review of the tax system in something like 50 years. The review has been out there working closely with everybody who is interested. The review has received over 1,300 formal submissions and over 4,000 pieces of correspondence. It has had something like 200 meetings; it has convened conferences. I am not going to speculate about the outcomes of the Henry review. That report will be handed to the government at the end of this year and we will release it with an initial response early next year.What I can talk about are the priorities that we have as a government for tax reform. We want to make the system simpler, fairer and more competitive. Individual Australians do not just see a tax system. What they see is a jungle. What we need to do is to make this system simpler. It is a fact that a very large proportion of Australians have to use a tax professional to prepare their tax returns - the largest proportion of any nation in the world. That is why we need to simplify the system. Australians deserve a simpler tax system. They need a simplified form of taxation as well.Tax reform will be hard. As I said before, those opposite squibbed it. They did not engage in fundamental tax reform at the peak of the mining boom. When the investment could have been made, they did not make it. This government will take the hard decisions when it comes to tax reform to secure the foundations of this economy and make them stronger for the future. Those opposite cannot face up to this reform, to fast national broadband, to educational reform or to any of the other long-term reforms that we have put in place. That is yet another demonstration of why they are incapable of governing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question, but also for his work on behalf of the many families in Bendigo who were so affected by the fires earlier this year. It is now eight months since the tragedy of the Victorian bushfires and it is the case that the government is still working with communities, families, the Victorian government and, of course, the Red Cross appeal fund to help people rebuild their lives and their businesses after what was nothing short of devastation.I would like to acknowledge the work that has been done by other local members and in particular I would like to thank Fran Bailey, the member for McEwen, for the work she has done, and to acknowledge her work. I thank her as she approaches her retirement. We do appreciate, Fran, in the area that was so badly affected, your very sincere dedication. I would also like to thank Bill Shorten, the parliamentary secretary who has done so much and been out there week after week, meeting with communities, listening to their issues and dealing with individual problems. I think all of this shows that a lot of people have worked with the locals to do what they can in the face of such devastation.Last Friday, at the Flowerdale Primary School, the Prime Minister was there with the Victorian Premier; the Chair of the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority, Christine Nixon; and Pat McNamara from the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund. Together they released the state-wide plan for bushfire reconstruction and recovery in Victoria, entitled very appropriately, I think, Rebuilding Together. The plan provides a further $193 million to continue rebuilding schools, police stations, sportsgrounds and community centres - all essential for recovery. It is also funding some very important environmental recovery - restoring waterways in catchments, repairing national park facilities and restocking local streams. All of these are critical issues that need to be addressed in those parts of Victoria that were affected by the bushfires.The Commonwealth government is contributing $52 million to this plan, and that money is on top of the $400 million which has already been committed by the Commonwealth as part of our response to the rebuilding effort. This includes money that went to individuals, money that was available for infrastructure, money that was available for the very important case management services and health services - particularly, right now, mental health services - and, on top of that, there was money for business support, whether it was for small businesses, farmers or tourism operators.As the Prime Minister said at the time:We knew that we would have to be there with communities for the long haul, rebuilding brick by brick, school by school, as we saw devastated communities getting back on track.When we were there on Friday, we met a fellow, Michael, on our way up to Flowerdale. He had just moved back into his newly rebuilt house. Obviously, it had been a very difficult time and, although he was very happy to be moving back into his home, of course, he reflected on just how difficult it still was for so many people. We know that there is still for many a lot of frustration and a lot of difficulties as they confront rebuilding their lives. We will stay the course with the people of Victoria as they confront the very difficult task of recovery. Once again, I thank all of the members who have been so dedicated to this task.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I do not think anyone in this House would dispute the passion which the member for Kennedy has in representing the interests of Indigenous Australians. I have heard him speak on this many times before. I have heard him speak on this before in jurisdictions other that than the Commonwealth parliament. So no-one questions his motivations in bringing forward questions to this place on the wellbeing of Indigenous Australians, including those whom he represents in the electorate of Kennedy.The first part of the honourable member's question went to Indigenous life expectancy. He is absolutely right to point to the obscenity of the 17-year life gap which currently exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. As the honourable member will recall, that is one of the core elements of this government's strategy entitled 'Closing the Gap' - that is, that we cannot be serious in claiming that we are closing the gap or have closed it until we have made measurable progress in bringing that obscene difference down. Of course, the constituent building blocks of that, which are what happens with child health, infant mortality as well as educational opportunity, employment opportunity and physical safety and security within communities, are fundamental building blocks towards achieving a reduction in that gap as far as life expectancy is concerned.We are also, as the honourable member would be familiar with, embracing a range of measures not just in the Northern Territory but also elsewhere in Australia in partnership with state and territory governments, many of which are quite controversial, in seeking to effect change in each of those measures. There are measures, for example, that we are engaged in in the Northern Territory which are highly controversial. There are also measures which we are completely supportive of by the government of Western Australia, which are in turn controversial. This government's resolve in bringing about substantial, measurable change in the gap in life expectancy is anchored in our strategy of closing the gap.The second point I would make to the honourable member's question is this: I draw his attention to the agreement that we reached for the first time with the states and territories in Darwin in, I seem to recall, about July of this year. For the first time we have a national agreement between all governments - state, territory and Commonwealth - on closing the gap across all the fields of policy. This has been fundamental. As the honourable member would know, for so many years we have had state and federal governments running in reverse directions, conflicting directions, in producing integrated policies on housing, integrated policies on education, integrated policies on health and integrated policies on community security and community welfare. I would draw his attention carefully to the list of measurables which are attached to the intergovernmental agreement which was framed at the July COAG convened in Darwin.The third point that the honourable member goes to in his question is of course the complex question of land entitlement. I do not seek to avoid the controversy which is also contained within that question. As the honourable member will know, there is a huge diversity of views across Indigenous Australia as to how the land title question is best handled for the future when it comes to individual Indigenous communities and across the nation. I am entirely familiar with the breadth of passions across that debate. This is not an easy one to fix. Of course, we are dealing with it in one small part in the statements which have been made by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs concerning certain housing infrastructure developments which we must undertake in the Northern Territory. They have involved quite controversial questions concerning the land tenure system.The final part of the honourable member's question goes to how we best coordinate within the federal government that which we are doing. I would draw to the honourable member's attention a decision which was taken some time ago by the Australian government to appoint the first Australian government coordinator-general for the delivery of federal government services to Indigenous Australians. Mr Gleeson was appointed to that position some time ago. I would invite the honourable member to spend some time with the minister and with Mr Gleeson to familiarise himself with exactly what he is seeking to do at the Commonwealth level.We have also encouraged our state counterparts to do the same so that we can speak with one voice in our dealings with Indigenous communities across the nation. The minister informs me that state and territory governments either have moved or are moving in a similar direction. We cannot allow, frankly, the federal-state divide to continue to undermine progress in bringing about a closing of the gap in reality, not just in name, because, as I said to this chamber at the time we delivered the apology to Indigenous Australians, our words will be as a sounding gong unless we achieve through our active strategies on the ground measurable changes in Indigenous communities which are provable in terms of life expectancy, infant mortality and child mortality as well as maternal life expectancy and educational and employment outcomes for our Indigenous brothers and sisters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question and note that I was recently with him in Gladstone as part of our consultations on the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report, when we had a very successful meeting with the health professionals from the Gladstone region as part of the national program of consultations which we have been undertaking. Today we will have had our 61st consultation, of which at least 20 have been in regional and rural areas, areas as diverse as Gladstone, Shepparton, Wagga, Whyalla, Bunbury, Derby, Alice Springs - and the list goes on. - The member for Barker pipes up about Murray Bridge. The member for Barker knows that the Prime Minister and I were in Murray Bridge as recently as last week in a consultation at which he was present, and I am sure he will agree that it was a very successful and positive meeting. There was a lot of support for the proposals within the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report and recommendations and a great deal of favour for the government by the community because it was the very first time in the history of the community that a sitting Prime Minister had visited the place. That in itself is something to be remarked upon. I know the member for Barker will know about the private practice at Murray Bridge, the Bridge Clinic rural general practice, which the Prime Minister and I were privileged to attend and to discuss with the medical practitioners and the health staff within that practice their ideas about how we might improve health care for people who live in regional and rural areas.The government has been and will continue listening carefully to what rural Australians have to say with regard to the health system and the NHHRC recommendations in particular. But I should say that it is important to acknowledge that the government has done a great deal already in addressing issues to do with rural health. There has been a 45 per cent increase in funding for rural health programs since the last full year of the previous government, 2006-07. This year's budget delivers $200 million to help tackle the shortage of doctors and health workers in rural and remote Australia. Significantly, as part of that package - and this was commented on by the Prime Minister in Murray Bridge - we are introducing $134.4 million for incentives and reforms to encourage doctors to work in some of Australia's most isolated and rural areas. The encouragement is based on a very, very simple principle, something I know all members will accord: the more remote you go, the greater the reward.These reforms mean that across Australia around 500 communities will now be eligible for rural incentives for the first time and more than 2,400 rural practitioners will become eligible for grant payments to remain in rural and remote areas. The retention payments will also be heavily geared, as I said, towards remoteness - and we make no apology for it. As a result of the reforms, more than 260 doctors who practise in the most remote locations will potentially have their maximum retention incentives increased from $25,000 per year to $47,000 per year. But it is not just about money. We acknowledge there are many issues which confront the rural workforce, in particular how to retain people in location. For many, this depends on getting adequate support. As part of our rural incentive program the government will establish a locum brokerage service to link doctors willing to do rural locum work to rural doctors and provide subsidies to cover some of their costs.These are very important initiatives. While the government are listening to the rural workforce and health professionals across Australia in relation to the recommendations of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report, we are actually on the job. Not only are we listening but we are doing the work that was not done by the previous government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The member who asked the question has been in contact with me and my office about this individual school, and what he knows from that contact is that the guidelines of the Building the Education Revolution Program did not provide, have never provided, for schools that have transient populations. Similar criteria have been used in the past for federal government capital programs because obviously the aim here, when we are talking about schools with transient populations like hospital schools, is that children go to them for a very limited period of time but their primary enrolment is in another school, their home school in their own community, and so their enrolment is counting towards the Building the Education Revolution allocations in their home school.The member who asked the question would also be aware that I have been working with him, I thought, to discuss the matters with the New South Wales government, because I understand that there are transient schools that have needs. As we know, the Building the Education Revolution guidelines require state governments to keep up their same level of capital investment. So of course it is possible for the school that he seeks to be advantaged - and I can understand as a local member he is advocating for his schools; that is proper - to benefit through a state government program, and we have been working with him on that.On the question of school closures, can I refer the member and the House to the Building the Education Revolution guidelines, which have always been crystal clear on this component. I will quote them to the House:Where two or more schools have a planned amalgamation over the next three years into either a new school site or an expansion of one of the existing schools, then the indicative funding allocation for the schools to be emerged may be combined to be used for capital or refurbishment in the new school. - Well, of course there is no inconsistency of treatment. I have explained to him the circumstances of transient schools -  -  - which have been used - before opposition members start jeering too much - in relation to federal government building programs in the past. - So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition might have a little think about that before she interjects further. On the amalgamation criteria, they have always been clear: if a school is amalgamating and not continuing, if it is merging, if schools are going to a new school site, then the Building the Education Revolution money goes to a continuing school.Can I also say to members of the opposition on this point that schools do open and close over time. We all know that. We all know in particular that small schools are at risk of closure. But can I say this to the House and to the members opposite: we on this side of the House are not going to discriminate against small schools in the allocation of funds under the Building the Education Revolution Program. There are 1,373 schools with enrolments of between one and 50 students. I presume what the members of the Liberal and National parties would say to us is: 'Don't invest in those schools because they're at risk of closure.' Well, let me tell you something. This government is not going to discriminate against small schools who are predominantly located in rural and regional electorates and places around the country. You might want to discriminate against country kids. The opposition might think that that is all well and good to discriminate against country kids in small schools. Well, we will not. And we will continue to ensure that they benefit under the Building the Education Revolution Program.Can I conclude by thanking the member for Flinders for making it absolutely clear, in the pages of the Australian newspaper last week, that the opposition considers that every dollar of this $16.2 billion for schools is a waste - his direct words, his direct quote. Well, the principals, teachers, students and parents of Australia believe it is a great investment in schools. It says something about the value system of the Liberal Party that they think investing $16.2 billion in schools is a waste.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for the question. I appreciate that she has been a long-term supporter of the oil and gas industry. I am pleased to advise the House that yesterday, along with many members of the House across both major political parties, I attended a function in the House to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the North West Shelf gas project. It is appropriate that the House was well represented. When you think about it, the North West Shelf venture has reached two major milestones this year - the 25th anniversary of domestic gas production and the 20th anniversary of LNG exports to the Asia-Pacific region.As I said at the launch yesterday of an ACIL Tasman report on the project's economic contribution to Australia, the project is iconic in Australia's economic history. It is an economic and engineering feat of the same national significance as the Snowy Mountains hydro scheme. Just think about these facts - and I know they are very much on the minds of the delegation from Papua New Guinea who are here in attendance for question time today. The project adds 0.7 per cent to Australia's GDP and five per cent to Western Australia's GSP each year. It spends about $800 million a year on Australian goods and services and generates about $1 billion a year in government revenue for important government services such as roads, railways, schools, hospitals and child care. It is also interesting to note that, over its life, the project has been the biggest resource development in Australia's history, with construction expenditures of more than $27 billion to date. If we started the project today, it would effectively mean an investment in the order of $50 billion. In terms of exports, more than 2,700 cargoes have been shipped to Asia, mostly Japan, over the last 20 years. Each of these LNG shipments could keep the lights at the MCG continuously on for 20 years.But what of the project partners? I think it is about time we gave credit where credit is due. Woodside, then a small Australian company, seized on a window of opportunity early in the development of the global LNG industry and put Australia at the heart of the industry's future. The North West Shelf project has built for Australia a very significant reputation as a reliable and secure LNG supplier and an attractive place in which to grow the industry into the 21st century. Without the success of the North West Shelf project, there would arguably be no Plutos or Gorgons for tomorrow. It is also interesting to note that LNG was a $10.1 billion export industry for Australia in 2008-09 and that, with the potential development of the Pluto and Gorgon projects, exports will grow to approximately $24 billion by 2017-18. Alternatively, if Pluto 2, Pluto 3, Ichthys, Browse, Sunrise, Prelude, Wheatstone and Gladstone LNG projects succeed, by the middle of next decade LNG exports could be in the order of $50 billion per annum.In addition to the export benefits, the LNG industry is a jobs powerhouse of the nation. I give credit to the North West Shelf joint venture partners: Woodside, BHP Billiton, BP, Chevron, Shell and Japan Australia LNG - better known as MIMI, a partnership between Mitsubishi and Mitsui. Perhaps more importantly, I refer to the comments made by George Kirkland, an executive vice president of Chevron, at the launch of the Gorgon project here in Australia last month. Chevron is the fifth-biggest company in the world, a partner in the North West Shelf project and the operator of the Gorgon project. He said:There is no doubt that this positions Australia very, very strongly in the gas world. It really and truly does. The good news is Saudi Arabia is all about oil, and what we're seeing in Australia is all about gas.The North West Shelf created a major opportunity for Australia in the past and it will create even better opportunities for Australia in the future. In that context, I also welcome the Papua New Guinea delegation to the House because, in discussions last night, accompanied by the ministers for trade and finance, we discussed not only the significance of the LNG industry to Australia but also the potential major economic significance of the industry for Papua New Guinea in the foreseeable future. The LNG industry has the opportunity to create a new foundation for Papua New Guinea in the 21st century, effectively creating jobs and export opportunities and, in doing so, reducing Papua New Guinea's dependence on Australian aid. I wish Papua New Guinea every success for its project.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Before I answer his question in some detail, I want to point out to him that I have made it clear, on all the questions that have been put to me in the House about approvals that I am required to consider under the EPBC Act, that I do not come to a view about the matter until the final advice has reached me. I do that in the context of the legislation which I am required to observe. On this particular matter, I say to the member that I am aware of the significant interest that Queenslanders have in this particular proposal and that it has been the subject of some significant assessment by the Queensland Coordinator-General under the bilateral agreements between the Commonwealth and the state. The Coordinator-General has provided that assessment to my department, and my department is considering the advice that is already in place in relation to this matter and will look closely at what the Coordinator-General brings forward, including the many conditions that he has attached to the proposal.I will consider the advice that my department brings forward to me. I will also consider carefully that which has been put to me by the scientists who have considered this and have made submissions to both the department and the assessment process, and also the public submissions that I have received. I have not yet received that advice. It has not come to me from my department. When it does, I will consider the matter and I will make my decision properly and within the time required.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I know she is someone who has dedicated a great deal of her life to supporting education and supporting students getting through school and into options beyond school. We have inherited from the former government a student income support system that is failing country students. Under the current student income support system, the participation rates of country students and poorer students in higher education are falling - the percentage is falling. At the same time, the student income support system we inherited from the Liberal Party and National Party government is one where some of Australia's richest families end up with a benefit. In particular, three per cent of the so-called independent students who actually live at home live in families with incomes of more than $300,000. That student income system is telling you something about the values of the Liberal Party and the National Party and the character of the people who were in leadership positions in those parties and could have made a difference to this gross inequity. It is a system where country and poorer kids' participation was falling and some of Australia's richest families were getting a benefit. We are determined to change this. Who is, of course, defending this inequity? They are the same old characters: the Liberal Party and the National Party.I had thought, in the time that the member for Casey was the shadow minister for education, that we were going to see an outbreak of reason in the Liberal Party. He actually said -  -  - I know - I am a dreadful optimist but a romantic optimist. He said a couple of sensible things. He said, 'Overall, the evidence seems to suggest that it has become too easy for students from affluent backgrounds to qualify and too difficult for students from modest backgrounds.' He was right about that. He said, 'This means that students from a family earning an average weekly income cannot effectively go straight from school to university and be supported. It particularly disadvantages many students - particularly those from the country - who have to leave home to study.' He was right about that. Our student income support system is about providing scholarships and support to students: providing 150,000 students a new scholarship of $2,254 each year - 28 times more scholarships than when we came to office - providing a $4,000 relocation scholarship to students who need to relocate, and changing the parental income test to benefit more families.But what do we see from the Liberal Party and the National Party? We see obstruction. We have amendments that the member for Sturt, the now shadow minister, wants to move which would - and can you believe this - tear $700 million out of scholarships. It would reduce the scholarships that students are getting from $2,254 per year to $1,000 per year. Remarkably, this scholarship rip-off is a permanent rip-off. To finance what the shadow minister says is a transition problem, he is going to rip students off from now until the end of time. No wonder these amendments from the Liberal Party have been characterised by the National Union of Students as 'scabby and sloppy'. I think we need to say this to members opposite: these scabby and sloppy amendments should not be proceeded with. The Liberal Party and the National Party should expedite passage of this legislation. This is what will guarantee for students next year the benefits of the new system. It is time to end the gross inequity that members opposite stood by and supported over 12 long years. We want to benefit country kids; we want to benefit poorer kids; we want to make sure taxpayers' dollars go where they are needed the most. It is time that the Liberal and the National parties actually got out of the way and endorsed a decent student income support system for Australian students.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Indeed, I can confirm that just last month, in a forum hosted by the member for Bennelong, I met with transport groups in the north-west, including state representatives, Greg Smith, the Mayor of Hornsby and other mayors. At that discussion we certainly confirmed that indeed, as part of this government's Nation Building Program, we have included the $150 million that we committed during the last campaign to undertake further planning into this link. That is part of the plan that was signed off by us and the New South Wales government in the memorandum of understanding. That plan takes us through to 2014 and is part of the comprehensive $36 billion that we have allocated to road and rail infrastructure projects over that period.It is interesting that those opposite, who are arguing day after day that we should actually withdraw our spending on infrastructure, when it comes to specific projects in their electorates - whether it is the member for Gippsland, the member for Berowra or other members over there - want to argue that they would actually spend more whilst also arguing that they would withdraw infrastructure spending priorities. I refer the honourable member to the comments of the shadow finance minister, Senator Coonan, when she indicated that we should be looking at the withdrawal of all our road and rail infrastructure projects that are not appropriate to be moving forward. I would ask her whether, were it the case that the honourable gentleman opposite had won the last election, that spending commitment, which is a part of the agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales, would be withdrawn.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for his question. It was my pleasure and privilege yesterday to visit Jakarta to attend the inauguration of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as President of Indonesia. I was there with the Prime Minister of Singapore, the Prime Minister of Malaysia and representatives of governments from around the region and around the world.This was an important occasion in our bilateral relationship. After 10 years of the return of democracy to Indonesia it is good to see we have now seen three successfully concluded elections in Indonesia. Indonesia represents a strong global and regional partner for Australia, now through the councils of the G20; increasingly on the question of climate change through the Bali road map, which leads to Copenhagen at the end of this year; and also of course in our combined efforts to combat transnational crime. I was also pleased to be able to speak with the President of Indonesia about Australia's efforts in assisting Indonesia with recent natural disasters, including the appalling earthquake and its human consequences at Padang and Sumatra.Together with the President of Indonesia, the Prime Minister of Singapore and the Prime Minister of Malaysia I also discussed separately our cooperation on transnational crime, particularly the challenge we all face with people smuggling. We expect to expand our cooperation with these governments into the future, including Indonesia, and we believe that is the right way to go. This is a global problem; it is a regional problem; it is a national problem for all of us.When the question of people smuggling arises, what we have been witness to in this place and in the community more broadly for the last period of time is the Liberal Party's most recent campaign, which is a fear campaign on immigration. The fear campaign is based on two core claims. The first is as follows -  - I think it would be useful for the honourable members opposite to actually listen to some figures. The first claim is that it was their immigration policy, the Pacific solution, which had children behind razor wire, that caused a reduction in asylum seekers coming to our shores. That is their first claim. The second claim is that it is this government's approach to immigration policy that has caused the increase in asylum seekers coming to Australian shores - leaving aside the fact that, when we changed temporary protection visas, those opposite did not vote against it; leaving aside the fact that, when we said we were abolishing the Pacific solution, the shadow minister for immigration said she supported that course of policy action; leaving aside the fact that, when we said we were going to remove children from behind razor wire, they embraced that as a policy solution as well. Let us leave aside those minor technical details and go to the two core claims.The first claim is that Liberal immigration policy was the cause of the decrease in boat arrivals in Australia in the period following 2001 - particularly in 1999, when temporary protection visas were introduced. Because of that, those opposite claim, there were significant reductions in the arrival of boatpeople from Afghanistan, from Iraq and also from Sri Lanka. That is the essence of their claim. The Liberal Party claims that this data is unquestionable and completely definitive proof that it was their policy that led to a reduction in asylum claims. But here is the unfortunate statistical fact: over the same period of time the reduction in the numbers of Afghans, Sri Lankans and Iraqis claiming asylum around the world also dropped - and by significant orders of magnitude. Around the world, between 2001 and 2003, Afghan asylum applications dropped from 52,000 to 14,000 - that is around the world. Iraqis claiming asylum around the world dropped from 52,000 to 27,000. For Sri Lankans, that number dropped around the world from 14,500 to 5,600.The reduction in asylum claims by Afghans, Iraqis and Sri Lankans, of which the Liberal Party is so proud in their belief that that was actually a direct cause of their policy, is in fact a global reality happening in every country around the world at about the same time. This was not Australian government policy at work at the time; it was because of the global reduction caused by local events in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sri Lankan, and the global response to it.Let us go to claim No. 2 advanced by those opposite. The second core claim of the Liberal immigration debate - the fear campaign currently being launched - is that it was the introduction of the government's immigration policy that led to an increase in asylum seekers arriving on our shores. Again, the script goes like this: because of these government changes we saw an increase in the number of Afghans arriving in Australia from 31 in 2005 to 52 in 2008 and the number of Sri Lankans increasing from 320 to 417 over the same period. Unfortunately for the Liberal Party, over the same period the number of Afghans claiming asylum around the world increased in the same period approximately from 7,700 to 18,000. The number of Sri Lankans applying for asylum around the world increased from 5,600 to 9,600. The increase in asylum claims by Afghans and Sri Lankans, which the Liberal Party is, shall we say, claiming to have been due to a change of government policy here in Australia, has been reflected around the world. -  - The dimensions of their injections suggest that the facts confront them again. The two core claims that underpin the member for Wentworth's engagement in this fear campaign on asylum seekers are in fact based on statistical fiction. These core claims are nothing more than Liberal Party fantasy. But they have been dreamt up in the same dark corners where the Liberal Party dreamt up the Pacific solution, where the Liberal Party dreamt up children behind razor wire and where the Liberal Party dreamt up other parallel measures.The Liberal Party is not about fact on the question of immigration policy; it is about the politics of fear. There is no substantive basis to their claims of policy success. There is no basis to their claims of policy failure. Asylum claims in Australia by Afghans, Sri Lankans and Iraqis have basically followed the global trend around the world. When numbers have fallen around the world, they have fallen in Australia. When numbers have increased around the world, they have increased in Australia. What we have seen in this place and beyond it is the party of children overboard, the party of Cornelia Rau, the party of Vivian Alvarez and, of course, the party of the forged email affair at it again at every level. On the question of immigration policy, this is a party without factual credibility on people smuggling, a party without policy credibility on people smuggling, but, worst of all, this is a party without one skerrick of moral compass when it comes to people smuggling as well.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - As the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has said on a number of occasions, the Christmas Island facility has sufficient capacity within it at present. He has also indicated on the public record that further provision has been made at an associated facility in Darwin. The government has made no bones about the fact that we will maintain a policy of mandatory detention for the speedy and proper processing of asylum seekers. This challenge, as I said in a press conference earlier today, has been with us in the past and will remain with us into the future - as it remains with other countries around the world.However, there is a key difference in approach. We believe in an approach which is balanced, which is tough but humane, when it comes to the challenge of asylum seekers. Yet we have on the part of the Leader of the Opposition a complete abandonment of principle in his response to the statements today by the member for O'Connor. This government makes no bones about the fact that we maintain a policy of mandatory detention to ensure that asylum seekers undertake health, identity and security checks when they arrive. However, the member for O'Connor went out there today and, effectively, claimed that every second or third boat arriving in Australia is carrying terrorists. That is what the member for O'Connor has, in effect, alleged today. - The question went to the processing of asylum seekers, and specifically in relation to a recently arrived boat. What I was outlining to the Leader of the Opposition in my response was the procedures we have in place for the processing on Christmas Island, the capacity which exists on that island and the reserve capabilities which the Attorney-General has referred to on a number of occasions in the debate so far.Furthermore, I was saying that, when it comes to the question of processing, that of itself is a product of our wider approach to policy on asylum seekers and the approach which we adopt in this place in the midst of the current debate about alternative approaches - hence the remarks which I have made already in this chamber today about the remarks made outside by the member for O'Connor. The member for O'Connor in his remarks outside today effectively claimed that every second or third boat arriving in Australia with asylum seekers is carrying terrorists. We can have the member for O'Connor seek to take a personal explanation, I am sure. And I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition will be keen to explain why he has chosen not to distance himself from the comments made by the member for O'Connor as well.For the record, nearly three-quarters of a million people have come to this country as refugees since the Second World War. In the period of the Howard government, 150,000 people came to this country as refugees. In the period of the Howard government nearly 15,000 came here as asylum seekers by boat. Ninety-five per cent of the temporary protection visas issued by the Howard government for asylum seekers resulted in permanent residency being granted. These are the facts which actually underpin this debate.If the Leader of the Opposition has one shred of credibility, one shred of decency, on the question of asylum seekers, he would stand on his feet, repudiate the member for O'Connor and withdraw his support for the endorsement of the member for O'Connor to contest the next election on behalf of the Liberal Party of Australia. -  - What we have had today is, frankly, a question of character on display on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. He convened a press conference at a quarter to two and was given an opportunity to distance himself; instead, he chose to embrace -  - I thank, of course, the member for Menzies for his intervention, because he strayed a long way indeed from any decency in immigration policy when he occupied that portfolio. -  - Of course, Mr Speaker, to assist the House. -  -  - On the question of immigration policy, the challenge which the Leader of the Opposition faced at a quarter to two this afternoon when he went out to conduct his own press conference on this matter was in fact to distance himself from the member for O'Connor. He chose not to do so. Therefore, we can only assume that the Leader of the Opposition embraces the remarks made by the member for O'Connor. He finds no problem with them. By virtue of his silence, he chooses to embrace them. When the shadow minister for immigration was asked about these comments earlier today, I am advised that she had no comment to make about the comments made by the member for O'Connor - a conspicuous display of courage on the part of the member for Murray in this debate.So we are left in this chamber asking this question: will, for the first time on this matter of asylum seekers policy, the Leader of the Opposition choose to lead his party or simply choose to follow the lead -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition had a simple challenge today, which was to step up to the plate and provide leadership. He failed to do so. What we have seen is an abandonment of principle and an abandonment of policy on the part of the Liberal Party on this debate on asylum seekers. What we have seen before is again unfolding, old faithful in the Liberal Party campaign handbook, which is the politics of fear and the politics of smear. This is a sad and sorry day when the character of the Leader of the Opposition has been put to question: would he stand up for a matter of principle and repudiate the member for O'Connor and his extraordinary remarks today or embrace them by his silence? He has chosen a course of action which shows an absolute want of courage and moral leadership on this most important question for the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The government is committed to a tough but humane policy on immigration. The immigration policy that we have taken in relation to people smugglers embraces a range of measures which are in part consistent with those adopted by the previous government and includes enhancements which have been embraced by this government as well. Furthermore, in dealing with the challenge of asylum seekers worldwide, we will do so on the basis of a humane policy consistent with our international obligations.The government has embraced this policy on immigration in part because the Liberal government which preceded it failed in a policy called the Pacific solution. The Pacific solution was ineffective and inhumane. It stripped away the dignity of human beings, most of whom are now lawfully living in Australia under decisions taken by the Howard government.The Liberal Party defend the Pacific solution based on one claim and one claim alone. They claim that the Pacific solution caused the reduction in asylum seekers coming to Australia between 2001 and 2003. Unfortunately, this claim does not stand up when compared with the global figures of the time. They are as follows. The Liberal Party need to reflect on the fact that around the world we saw decreases in the arrival of asylum seekers across this period. Between 2001 and 2003, the number of Iraqis claiming asylum worldwide dropped from 52,000 to 27,000 - a drop of 48 per cent. Between 2001 and 2003, the number of Afghans claiming asylum globally dropped from 50,000 to 14,000 - a decrease of 73 per cent. Between 2001 and 2003, the number of Sri Lankans claiming asylum globally dropped from 14,000 to 5,600 - a decrease of 61 per cent.The decrease in asylum seekers we experienced arriving in Australia after the introduction of the Pacific solution happened at exactly the same time as decreases were occurring worldwide. The number of arrivals went down in Australia; they went down in the United Kingdom; they went down in Europe; they went down around the world. - The only problem that the Pacific solution solved was the Liberal Party's predisposition to find the next scare campaign, about which the member for Berowra now, interestingly, interjects. The success of the Pacific solution was in many respects trumpeted by those opposite as an effective response to the real problem of asylum seekers. In fact, it did no such thing if you examine carefully the global statistics from the time. That is myth No. 1.What is myth No. 2? Myth No. 2 from the Liberal Party is that this government's new tough and humane immigration policy caused the current increase in asylum seekers arriving in Australia. That is exactly what they argue day in, day out on the doors and in the particular form of expression used by the member for Murray, the member for O'Connor and other members with a similar approach to these questions. Unfortunately, once again, this claim is simply false when compared again against the global figures. Between 2005 and 2008, the number of Iraqis claiming asylum globally increased from 14,000 to 42,000 - an increase of 193 per cent. Between 2005 and 2008, the number of Sri Lankans claiming asylum globally increased from 5,000 to nearly 10,000 - an increase of in excess of 75 per cent. Between 2005 and 2008, the number of Afghans claiming asylum globally increased from 7,000 to 18,000, a 139 per cent increase.The increase in asylum seekers we are experiencing in Australia is happening at exactly the same time everywhere across the world. It is happening in Australia, it is happening in the United Kingdom, it is happening in Europe and it is happening around the world. When the global asylum claims go up around the world they also go up for Australia; when they go down around the world they also go down for Australia. That is myth No. 2.Let us explore myth No. 3, which goes to the purported implication by the member for Murray, among others, that they have advocated a different policy in the past since this government has been elected. This is a very interesting point indeed because every time the Liberal Party get to their feet on the question of asylum seekers there is always a bit of a wink-wink, nudge-nudge that they actually have represented a different approach in the period since the last election. Let us subject this to a little scrutiny as well and actually go to the detail. When the government chose to abolish temporary protection visas, what did those opposite do? They did nothing. They did not vote against it one bit - absolute inaction. They now, however, seek to pretend that something was different.Let us go to the other one, which is the whole question of an alternative policy which was considered by the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The committee recommended that, as a priority, the Australian government introduce amendments to the Migration Act -  - You always know when the member for Murray is in trouble: she starts interjecting at a pace of knots. The committee recommended that, as a priority, the Australian government introduce amendments to the Migration Act 1958 to enshrine in legislation the reforms to immigration detention policy announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans. Sharman Stone, the member for Murray, was a member of that same parliamentary committee and said, 'Labor is very much echoing what we did.' Then, when asked if she welcomed the report's recommendations to finetune the system, she said, 'I do.' On 16 April this year the member for Murray ruled out the reopening of offshore processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island. That is the Pacific solution. I quote the member for Murray again, as she studies her documents carefully knowing that these actually reflect what she has put on the public record:We no longer have that requirement because we've got an alternative place which is in our excised migration zone, Christmas Island.Myth No. 1, myth No. 2 and myth No. 3. What they have engaged in instead is simply the politics of fear. What they have sought to do is to deliberately cultivate a culture of fear in Australia about this because they, consistent with those who have gone before them, believe that this represents an excellent political strategy for the opposition rather than a real solution to the problem.This is the party of the Pacific solution, this is the party of kids behind razor wire, this is the party of Vivian Alvarez and this is the party of Cornelia Rau - as those opposite who have previously held that office as migration ministers bury their heads again in their papers pretending that none of this ever happened and all can be carefully and precisely airbrushed from history. In fact, it cannot be so. The Liberal Party fear and smear campaign on this matter has no basis in fact, no basis in policy and no basis in morality. But the time has come for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up and show some leadership on this question, to lead for the first time rather than always to follow.</DOC>

 - As I said in response to a question in this place yesterday, this government makes no apology whatsoever for the fact that it is expanding its cooperation with the Indonesian government in the area of people smuggling. That is because we are dealing with a global problem and a regional problem which requires the highest level of coordination with our friends and partners in Indonesia. The honourable gentleman's first part of his question dealt with who actually is responsible for the processing within Indonesia. That of course is a matter for the Indonesian government. I would imagine that would involve the office of the UNHCR as well. The outcome of that processing - where individuals are resettled, how long a period of time that takes or how many of those individuals are sent back to a country of origin - is, of course, contingent on a proper UNHCR approval process. That is why we cooperate in these matters with the Indonesian government - because we believe it is the right approach for the future.The honourable member asked a question about the processing of asylum seekers in Indonesia and yesterday, when he asked questions, he went to the point of the source of the asylum seekers arriving, namely, his questions about Afghanistan. What I found remarkable about the question yesterday was how the Leader of the Opposition fundamentally misrepresented the statements made by the Minister for Defence about our policy on Afghanistan. Here is what the defence minister had to say yesterday in the interview which was referred to and then deployed in a particular way by the Leader of the Opposition. - I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition would be interested in a question which goes to the possible links between terrorist training in Afghanistan and asylum seekers in the region, given his decision to embrace the position taken by the member for O'Connor today. He inferred yesterday that the government's policy on Afghanistan had changed. I conclude on this, Mr Speaker. This is what the defence minister had to say yesterday -  - Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. Of course, this is relevant to the truthfulness which underpins various of the assertions that we hear in this place, because the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that the government had embraced a policy for early withdrawal from Afghanistan. In the interview upon which he had based that, the defence minister says 'I haven't of course put a timeline on completing the training task' in Afghanistan. The verballing that we had from those opposite of the defence minister yesterday suggests the care and attention they dedicate to truth in this general debate on asylum seekers where the overriding objective is the politics of fear and smear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for this question. She has had a longstanding interest in ensuring that our immigration policies are appropriate. Of course considerations of health concerns are serious ones and if raised properly would be issues that should be part of this discussion. In fact, most people in this House would be aware that one of the key purposes of a mandatory detention policy is to ensure that health, identity and security checks can be properly undertaken. We believe that these processes are a prudent course of action and an appropriate precaution.However, I do not think that it assists the debate on this very serious issue to have members of the opposition comparing asylum seekers to cattle that spread foot and mouth disease. It is important to ensure that any people coming to and settling in our community are not going to spread disease. We take necessary, careful and precautionary action. One of the key reasons that we have a mandatory detention policy is to ensure that adequate health checks can be undertaken while people are detained to ensure that the community is properly protected.As I said, I do not think that it assists the debate at all to have outrageous comparisons being made. It would serve all in the House well to go back to the basics. It is a policy that was adhered to by a previous Labor government; it was a policy that was adhered to by the previous coalition government. Health checks have always been a fundamental part of our immigration policies and particularly our mandatory detention policies. It might be well if the Leader of the Opposition could remind some members of his party to keep that in mind and take a sensible approach to ensure that health checks can be undertaken but that we do not have inflammatory comments made that might turn this into an even uglier debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin. I know that he is concerned about how we will respond with skills and training to the challenges of climate change. If you are going to lead the nation in the face of major challenges like tackling climate change then you need to have the capacity to lead. That is something that the opposition leader today has shown he does not have, as leadership on an important topic has passed to the member for O'Connor. Once again, it is true that as this nation faces the challenge of climate change it is the Rudd Labor government that is leading on this question and particularly leading in the development of the skills that we will need in our economy as we move to a lower carbon age.As an example of us providing that leadership, I remind the House that on 30 July the Prime Minister announced our Clean Sustainable Skills Package. This was a $94 million investment to provide 50,000 young or disadvantaged Australians with training or job opportunities in the green skills that we will need for tomorrow. This package included 30,000 apprentices who will graduate over the next two years with the green skills that we will need for tomorrow. I remind the House that these green skills are needed in the most traditional of occupations, such as being a plumber, a carpenter, a motor mechanic. The nature of that work will change in a low-carbon economy.This package provided 10,000 unemployed young Australians with the ability to join our national Green Corps initiative. It provided 4,000 training opportunities for people who are going to be involved in installing insulation in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of our nation. It also included 6,000 new local jobs in green skills and heritage projects. This package builds on our investment of around $200 million in vocational education and training through our teaching and capital learning fund, because we know that our VET sector will be providing a leading role in these new clean green skills for the future, and it builds on our $650 million sustainability round and Clean Energy Initiative for our university and TAFE systems to get ready for the economy of the future.We have moved to deliver the biggest school modernisation project the nation has ever seen - and every dollar, every building, every big of maintenance and every job has been opposed by members of the Liberal Party. I take this opportunity to update the House on the fact that 82 per cent of buildings have incorporated insulation, 81 per cent have incorporated energy efficiency lighting, 57 per cent have incorporated water tanks and 2,400 projects have involved the installation of solar panels.I am today advising the House that we are taking the next step in our green skills agenda. We will be entering a national green skills agreement with the states and territories, which will commence from 1 January next year, to help Australians get the skills that they will need for the future. Tomorrow I am hosting a green skills forum in Melbourne to consider the draft agreement and to make sure that those who care desperately about ensuring that Australia is prosperous and adapted to a low-carbon age come together for that discussion. This government will of course continue to provide the leadership necessary in the face of the big challenges of our age. I anticipate that what we will see from those opposite is what we have seen today from the Leader of the Opposition: a lack of courage and a lack of leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. As we know, there were injured passengers on SIEV36. They have since been discharged from hospital. We also know that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship had provided visas for those that were on board. This is a very tragic event, of course. This was very difficult for our personnel who were involved. It was a very difficult time for those people on that particular vessel. These matters have been subject to the Northern Territory coronial inquiry. They have also been subject to investigation by the Northern Territorian police. I am advised that the decision made by the department of immigration in relation to the visas of these people has been made in consultation with the police.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. It is a very important question because it is very clear and it is very consistent that respected economists and business groups believe that the government stimulus has kept the Australian economy growing in the face of the worst global recession in 75 years. And while virtually every advanced economy suffered a deep recession, our stimulus has ensured that that did not happen in this country. As a consequence Australia has had the strongest growth of 33 advanced economies - the only one to have grown through the year to June.Because we acted quickly and we got in early we have been able to limit the worst effects of this global recession on Australian businesses, families and, of course, the economy. This is a view which is shared by economists and representatives of business. This is what the director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry had to say to the Senate inquiry last month. He said:The Australian government was right to take this path and in fact to act more quickly and decisively than most _ the scope and scale of stimulus was entirely warranted.And that has been backed very strongly by business economists like Rory Robertson. At that same Senate inquiry he said:In terms of the formulation, there may not have been a more sensible package.He said that Australian policymakers, like most of their counterparts across the world, moved macroeconomic policy 'sharply in the right direction'.Had it not been for our economic stimulus, and particularly our investment in infrastructure, the Australian economy would have been in recession. The fiscal stimulus was designed to have its maximum impact in the middle of this year, in June, and then to be gradually withdrawn from that time on. The stimulus, therefore, has already peaked and is gradually tapering away.It is this in-built withdrawal which the Governor of the Reserve Bank referred to last month when he made this comment, which I think is pretty relevant to all of those opposite. He said:Such an outcome would mean that fiscal and monetary policy would be acting broadly consistently, as they did when they were moved in the expansionary direction when the economy was slowing.That statement was made only on 28 September. So I think it is the case that economists and business groups all agree that the stimulus is important. They also agree that its job is not finished, because withdrawing stimulus overnight would be simply devastating to tens of thousands of small businesses in this country and to tens of thousands of their employees.That is why Dr Peter Burn of the Australian Industry Group had this to say on 28 September:We are very wary of calls for the fiscal measures to be wound back ahead of the in-built schedule for their withdrawal. We think that this could undermine the recovery that appears to be taking hold.That is a complete repudiation of the position of opposition members in this House. We know that opposition members in this House have been voting against the economic stimulus in the House and then going out into their own electorates and supporting it there and trying to claim credit for it.I guess we are pretty used to that hypocrisy, but today I think I can reveal another chapter in that hypocrisy because on 12 March the shadow minister for families said in this chamber about the government's response to the global financial crisis, 'We are against the government's stimulus package.' Again on 5 February he said, 'What this government is doing is too much and too soon.' I can report to the House that the shadow minister for families went down to Canberra Grammar on Tuesday to address students and give them his views about life. This is a shadow minister in the opposition - the shadow minister for families. He went down there and do you know what he said? He said that the Rudd government 'handled the global financial crisis well.' So one thing in this House and entirely another outside of the House. He was pretty quick to tell all the assembled students that he would not be able to make that comment outside the classroom because the media might get onto it. We can understand his embarrassment because we can understand the embarrassment of all of those opposite. The hypocrisy of all those opposite is now clear for everybody to see.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I have not received such advice. The first time I saw a suggestion that the vessel in distress may have been in distress as a result of actions of the people on board was when I read the front page of today's Australian newspaper. -  - As I made clear on radio this morning, it is very, very important in my view that we take allegations and suggestions like that very carefully and in an appropriate, methodical process.Let us be very clear about the circumstances of this case. Calls were made to Australian search and rescue authorities indicating that a vessel was in distress. The vessel in distress was in the Indonesian search and rescue area. As a consequence of that, I am advised that Australian officials contacted the relevant Indonesian search and rescue maritime authorities to indicate that a vessel was distressed in an area that was the responsibility of Indonesia. I am also advised that Indonesian officials indicated to Australian officials that they had no vessels in the vicinity and asked if Australia could help. Australian officials then contacted commercial shipping assets to see whether commercial assets were in the area, and when that inquiry indicated that no commercial assets were in the area the Armidale was sent to the vessel in distress.I am advised two things occurred when the Armidale made contact with the vessel. One was that a young child on board was ill and may well have required medical attention. Secondly, a conclusion was made that the vessel was not able to go to port under its own steam. As a consequence the people on board, for humanitarian and for safety-at-sea obligations, were transferred to the Oceanic Viking. This was done at the request of the Indonesian search and rescue authorities and with the Indonesian search and rescue authorities being the lead agency.The suggestion that somehow the vessel was in distress was, as I said, first drawn to my attention when it appeared on the front page of today's Australian, for a very good reason. The obligation and the requirement on the part of the Australian government, its officials and its agencies, and the obligation on Australia, is to discharge our humanitarian and our search and rescue operations on the high seas. That is in the interests of Australia and in the interests of Australian citizens and that was done. When the suggestion was made that the vessel in distress may have been the subject of distress because of action by those on board - and I might say that the only thing I have seen so far is the Australian newspaper, which cites 'sources' that are not identified at all - The member for Dickson then left the chamber. - The seat of Dickson has been vacated twice! When the article was drawn to my attention, I made inquiries and the sensible advice I received was this: when the people on board the Oceanic Viking have been safely ported in Indonesia, then in the normal course of events what will occur will be a review as to the circumstances leading to this matter. I am not proposing to rely upon or respond to assertions. I am very happy to wait until I receive, and other ministers receive, the expert advice and the expert report from those on the HMAS Armidale and from those on the Oceanic Viking as to the state of the vessel in distress.I also take the opportunity of drawing to the House's attention that today in Senate estimates the Ambassador for People Smuggling Issues has said that he has not come to a concluded view. That will be done in the fullness of time - methodically, sensibly, not emotionally, not in a way which seeks to score political points. But his understanding is that the rudder apparatus of the vessel was disabled. - We have seen examples in the past of where people jumped to conclusions about how things may have occurred on the high seas. And we have seen in the past some people try and take or make political advantage of that domestically in Australia - off the backs of the most vulnerable people that we have seen, off the backs of those people at risk on the high seas, off the backs of those people who rely upon not just Australia but other nation states to discharge their obligations for search and rescue on the high seas. The request came from Indonesian search and rescue authorities for Australia to assist. - Of course, anyone with any familiarity with these issues would know that, when a request came from the Indonesian authorities to assist the vessel in the Indonesian search and rescue area, if Australia had acted, there may well have been immigration consequences to flow from that. Those consequences were not known conclusively at the time. They are not known now because the people onboard that vessel have not been the subject of the UNHCR procedures, and the Indonesian government has indicated they will be. But whether there were to be immigration, refugee or asylum seeker consequences or not, Australia had a moral, a humanitarian and a national interest obligation to discharge our duties to rescue people in distress at sea, and that is what we did.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. I note that in a continent such as ours, which has a small population spread across a vast area, transport infrastructure is absolutely vital to our economic performance. Under the government's nation-building program we have more than doubled the federal roads budget and we have more than quadrupled the investment in rail. A majority of this funding has been allocated to regional and rural Australia. Today I can confirm that work has started on yet another rail project, the $56 million upgrade of the line between the New South Wales border and the Brisbane suburb of Acacia Ridge, funded from the economic stimulus - an important project that will support 120 jobs and improve the overall efficiency of the interstate network. The start of this project means that construction work which is now underway has ticked over the $9 billion mark, including the Brighton bypass down in Tassie, the northern expressway in Adelaide, the Western Ring Road in Melbourne, the Ipswich Motorway upgrade and the upgrade of the Hunter Valley rail network. In addition to that work which is now underway, we have completed 32 large-scale infrastructure projects within our first two years in office - 32 projects announced, built, completed.As well as building the road and rail infrastructure vital to our long-term economic prosperity, this investment has helped to shield the national economy from the full impact of the global economic downturn. Indeed, the Australian Constructors Association and the Australian Industry Group have noted this in their report released today. In a media release headed 'Tough conditions forecast for engineering and commercial construction', which I table, they remind the House that we are certainly not out of the woods yet, that there are still major challenges occurring because of the downturn, particularly in commercial construction. Their survey found that Australia's construction companies are predicting an eight per cent fall in the total value of engineering and commercial construction work for the current financial year, followed by a further decline in 2010-2011. Indeed, the President of the Constructors Association, Wal King, said this:'Encouragingly, the survey results indicate that the Government's infrastructure stimulus measures and the number of large Government supported programs in the pipeline have avoided a larger downturn in activity _'Importantly, the results indicate that infrastructure work will remain at high levels _Heather Ridout, the CEO of the Australian Industry Group, said in her statement:_ there should be no confusion about the need to proceed with the 'big planned economic infrastructure investments'.Industry has been saying repeatedly that we are filling the void that was created by 12 years of neglect of major infrastructure. That is why I would say to the opposition - particularly to the opposition leader and Senator Coonan, the shadow finance minister, who have drawn into question the government's infrastructure proposals - that they should actually sit down with the business community, analyse what is actually going on in the real world economy and support this government's ongoing infrastructure investment which is supporting jobs today and building the infrastructure that we will need for our long-term prosperity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. - It was a timely question, indeed, with the release today of the State of Australia's Young People report showing once more that today's young people face a range of issues and concerns which are unique to their generation - cyber bullying, body image and unprecedented levels of violence and devastation in street assaults, to name a few. These are all issues which those opposite showed they were not interested in during their 12 years in government when they sidelined youth and abolished the portfolio, but they are issues which we take very seriously. In light of this, the Prime Minister has announced the government's development of a national strategy for young Australians. The truth is that it is in all of our interests to ensure that young people are supported in their families and in their communities, that they are well served in the education and training sector, that they have access to early intervention services and programs to get their lives back on track, that they are equipped for their future employment, that they are aware of both their rights and responsibilities. These will form the core of the national strategy.We also know that the only way to provide tangible and long-term results in these areas is by working in direct partnership with young people, as well as with their families and their communities. That is why earlier this morning, in an interactive launch out at Lyneham High School with students from years 9 and 10 and with the Prime Minister technologically armed in his office with a live blog and tweets with young people right around Australia, we launched the national conversation, a series of meetings, forums and online activities right around the country, which will engage in real discussion and real action as part of this national strategy. - We also demonstrated that we are serious about action in this area. The member opposite has very kindly mentioned the 2020 Summit. I would like to inform him that earlier today the Prime Minister and I announced that the government will provide $10 million for the development of arts, business and community youth centres to encourage community based activities. This was one of the 10 recommendations from the Youth 2020 Summit when 100 young people from right around Australia came forward and put their views to government. Thank you for reminding me of that. These centres will offer a safe place for young people to socialise, as well as develop their skills in education, training and employment. This is yet another example of how this government is listening to young Australians and also acting on the advice they put forward.Also announced earlier this morning was the inaugural Prime Minister's Australian Youth Forum challenge, which will make available $120,000 in grants as part of a national competition for young people to get creative about how they get active and get other young people in their communities active and involved in their causes.The third announcement which was made as part of the national strategy was in relation to violence. The Prime Minister has outlined that he has asked the Minister for Home Affairs to work with state ministers to work on the advice of our police commissioners to identify how best to tackle youth violence on our streets. We will have more to say on this very soon. We hear the community when they say that enough is enough. We hear the young people when they say that they want to be safe and secure when they are with their friends.We are very serious about this national strategy for young Australians. We are serious about the national conversation and we are asking all MPs to become involved in their own communities by hosting forums in their own electorates. We have given resources to all members to ensure that they do that. We are also encouraging young people to become involved. If your local member does not take up the invitation to host one of the forums, we would ask that they access the website at www.youth.gov.au. Thank you.</DOC>

 - I am unaware of such advice. I say to the honourable gentleman, the Leader of the Opposition, that I am sure that those engaged in the vile trade of people-smuggling would be conveying any sort of message to those who are the victims of their trade around the world in order to encourage their trade. Whether or not that information is accurate, that is the sort of dissimulation and disinformation in which people smugglers would engage. They do not represent an honourable profession. They represent a dishonourable profession which trades in lies, so it would not surprise me what people smugglers said to anyone at any time in any place in order to increase their trade.</DOC>

 - Today is Pink Ribbon Day, a day when we reflect on breast cancer and its impact on Australian women, on Australian families and on the nation as a whole. Over the next 12 months, some 12,000 Australian women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and, over the next year, more than 2½ thousand Australian women will die of breast cancer. Also, over the next year, tens of thousands of Australian women will continue their very personal fight against breast cancer and they will prevail - they will win that fight. These are very much the three human faces of breast cancer: shock, suffering and survival. This is the challenge that we are reminded of on this Pink Ribbon Day.These are mothers, grandmothers, daughters, wives, aunts, nieces, sisters, partners, friends, workmates and neighbours. Each of these diagnoses will touch the lives of the families and communities who support women who are suffering from breast cancer, from the initial shock and disbelief of the diagnosis to the fear and worry about the future, to the traumatic effects of treatment, to thankfully, for most, the joy of remission and recovery - but, tragically, for some, to the despair of losing a mother, a wife, a daughter or a friend.Like many in this place, my own mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and she was only 39 years old. She survived and went on to live until the ripe old age of 83. When it came to breast cancer, she was a survivor. Last week, my wife, Therese, helped launch a new audio resource for men whose partners are diagnosed with breast cancer. As Therese said at the time, behind every woman who receives a breast cancer diagnosis there is often a man whose world has also been turned upside down as he is then confronted with the challenge and the responsibility of supporting his partner, his wife, his companion in an extraordinarily difficult challenge. Helping partners and friends and family to effectively support those who are diagnosed with breast cancer is an important part of our national response.Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in Australian women. It accounts for more than one in four cancer diagnoses in women. The Australian government are currently investing some $2 billion in building a world-class cancer care system. This includes $12 million to the McGrath Foundation to recruit, train and place 44 breast cancer nurses across Australia, forty-three of whom have already started work; $31 million to reimburse women who have had a mastectomy as a result of breast cancer for the cost of external breast prostheses; funding for MRI scans for women under the age of 50 who have a family history of breast cancer; $120 million to replace BreastScreen Australia's outdated equipment with state-of-the-art digital mammography equipment; and $168 million for the breast cancer drug Herceptin. We are also working with the National Breast Cancer Foundation, the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre and the Breast Cancer Network Australia on special initiatives and programs, including a $2.7 million program to improve supportive care for women in rural areas who are diagnosed with breast cancer.On top of this, the government is also investing some $1.3 billion in the nation's cancer infrastructure, including $526 million towards two integrated cancer care centres that will provide state-of-the-art cancer treatment combined with cutting-edge research - the Chris O'Brien Cancer Centre in Sydney and the Parkville Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Melbourne - as well as $560 million to help build a network of best-practice regional cancer centres to help close the gap for cancer patients in rural and regional Australia.As a nation we have lost far too many good women to this disease. As a nation we have watched and hoped and prayed as some of our best women have battled this disease. We have mourned those who have lost their battle. We have celebrated those who have won their fight against breast cancer. We also celebrate the lives of those women who have turned their struggle with the disease into a rallying call for better services, better treatments, better research and ultimately a better outlook for other women in the future. These are women who exemplify those core Australian characteristics of compassion, courage and resilience. Today all of us in this chamber, government and opposition alike, are proudly wearing pink ribbons to show our support, our admiration and our respect for these brave Australian women, and our determination to do all we can to help raise money and awareness for women battling breast cancer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I would say in response to his question that, as he would know, people-smuggling has been a challenge for this country for 20 or 30 years - in fact, going back many decades. I also say to the honourable gentleman that, in the period that he occupied the government benches, the Howard government saw nearly 15,000 people arrive in this country by boat - altogether nearly 250 boats. One of the elements of policy which I assume he wishes this government to return to is temporary protection visas. I draw his attention to the fact that 90 per cent plus of those granted temporary protection visas by the then government ended up settling in Australia.I, therefore, draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that this is a problem which has been with Australia for a long time. It will be with Australia for a long time into the future because it is always driven by what is happening in our region and the wider world, as it confronts other countries as well. Our policy is unapologetically tough but humane. We will continue to implement that policy into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. The Australian government is working hard with our regional neighbours to combat the challenge of people-smuggling. Our regional neighbours, like us, recognise that there are no easy options in tackling this challenge. For all countries these are tough challenges; they are not easy challenges. Our policy, as I said to those opposite just before, is unapologetically tough when it comes to people smugglers and unapologetically humane when it comes to dealing with asylum seekers. It is a tough but humane approach.The risks on the high seas are too great, the tragedy of disasters too high and the incentives for people smugglers too great not to attempt to reduce the number of boats leaving Indonesia or other countries. We, the government, make no apology for this regional approach. The truth is that people impacted by such a policy will not support it. It will not be praised by all Australians - it is not praised by all Australians. Asylum seekers do not want to settle in Indonesia, nor do they wish to be processed in Indonesia, but no-one wants to see a repeat of the tragedies on the high seas that we have seen in times past, no-one wants to see a repeat of the sinkings and the drownings that we have seen in the past and no-one wants to encourage people smugglers to put the lives of innocent people at risk. That is why we must do all we credibly can to reduce the number of boats that are leaving regional countries.If detention and processing in Indonesia help prevent some of these perilous journeys then we must support such a policy. We must continue working with Indonesia, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the International Organisation for Migration to improve facilities in Indonesia and the speed with which asylum seekers' applications are processed. If asylum seekers processed in Indonesia are found to be genuine refugees then Australia, as previous Australian governments have done, together with other countries around the world, will continue to assist with the resettlement of such refugees. We must also continue to cooperate with Indonesia and other regional neighbours to do whatever is possible to prevent people-smuggling operations before they begin. Our policy objectives are clear cut - to deter people smugglers, in cooperation with regional partners, and to reduce the number of people who put their lives at risk in the hands of people smugglers.This morning I returned from the East Asia Summit, where again government leaders from around the world and around our region recognised that this in fact is a transnational challenge. The summit communique released yesterday said:We - the 16 governments of the East Asia Summit - reaffirmed our commitment to combat people smuggling and trafficking in persons. We stressed the importance of continued bilateral and regional cooperative efforts, including through the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, to address the impact of these and other transnational crimes.Our regional partners and friends in east Asia recognise that this is a global problem. It is a regional problem. Forty-two million displaced people around the world, including 15.2 million who are refugees, and the increases in Iraqi, Afghan and Sri Lankan outflows over the last three years, has gone up respectively in the vicinity of 75, 100, 150 to nearly 200 per cent. We have also had this challenge in transit countries.I note from some of the commentary that has been around of late that there is somehow a suggestion that Australian support for Indonesian efforts in this area - including in the processing facilities within Indonesia - is somehow a new initiative on the part of this government. For the information of the House, the Howard government launched initiatives to provide around $25 million for capacity-building initiatives in Indonesia over the last five years, including the refurbishment of detention facilities in Indonesia through the IOM, two Indonesian detention facilities at Tanjung Pinang and Jakarta, and for the training of Indonesian officials. It was also for the establishment of a network of IOM outreach officers to assist Indonesian authorities to monitor and manage a regular migration flow - some $2.6 million.Furthermore, since 1999 Australian governments have provided $34.7 million to support humanitarian assistance in Indonesia, including accommodation, food and medical assistance for irregular migrants to Indonesia intercepted en route to Australia. For some to suggest that this is somehow a new departure in policy I think does not reflect accurately upon the historical record. This government's policy, as I have said before, seeks to take a hard-line approach with people smugglers and seeks to adopt a humane approach with asylum seekers. It is the balanced approach adopted by mainstream governments around the world. We have also invested a record amount in surveillance and interception. There was some $654 million additionally announced in the last budget and in 2008-09 the total number of flying hours and sea days undertaken by vessels and aircraft - conducting surveillance in our northern waters - was more than in the previous year, with the number of sea days in 2008-09 being 25 per cent more than 2005-06. Our policy is also unapologetically humane. We have ended mandatory detention for children. Some opposite seemed to be calling for its return. We have abolished the failed temporary protection visas. Some opposite seem to be advocating its return. We have scrapped the so-called Pacific solution. Now those opposite, it seems, advocate its return.In the period that the government has been in, we have had some 85 disruptions of planned smuggling adventures since September 2008, involving nearly 2,000 persons. That has been with the assistance of the Indonesian national police. The government has already returned almost 100 people because their asylum claims have been refused. Since September 2008, 15 people have been convicted in Australian courts and eight separate people are facing people-smuggling prosecutions. Further, currently before the Australian courts are 38 defendants in 14 separate matters, with three defendants in three separate matters involving organisers and facilitators. This is the practical action which goes to a practical and balanced policy on dealing with the scourge of people smugglers and the humanitarian plight of asylum seekers. It is a balanced approach, a mainstream approach; one which unapologetically also engages our friends and partners in the region, as previous Australian governments - were they to honestly reflect - have done as well.</DOC>

 - This government - together with previous governments, I would hope - would always adhere to its obligations under international maritime law when it comes to requests for assistance on the high seas. I would assume that all governments would adhere to their obligations because Australian citizens who find themselves at sea in parallel circumstances would I think expect other governments around the world to adhere to the same international protocols which govern -  - The question dealt with anything from what was on television last night through to what was effective on the ground, including our obligations under international maritime law. So what I am answering at the moment is that part of the question which dealt with obligations under international maritime law, which I think all governments - all civilised governments around the world - would seek to adhere to. The honourable gentleman refers to, it seems, his new source on television last night. I assume he has at least received some email communication from that source and I assume it has been properly authenticated. Can I say to the honourable gentleman that this is a serious debate for the country. - I welcome, always, interventions from the member for Murray, given her complete endorsement of current government policy on immigration only last year. When asked if she supported the government's approach on migration policy, she said - almost as if she was taking a marriage vow - I do. That is what she said. So I always welcome this consistency in approach on the part of those opposite when it comes to these matters. We have seen it in a few other areas of policy as well: support one thing one day, change our tune the next depending on what is going on with the debate. - The honourable gentleman's question went to the particular motivations of individuals who were seeking to exit a particular country en route to Australia and whether they were embarked upon deliberate tactics so to do. Obviously, the circumstances with each individual vessel will differ. That is simply the reality. Our job is to respond through the medium of a balanced, fair, tough, humane policy, which we are prosecuting and will continue to do so into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question about how Australia is responding, together with our region, in particular Indonesia, to the challenge of people smuggling and people movement. Of course, we know that throughout the world today we have over 40 million displaced people with very many of those potentially in our region or displaced towards our region. So regional cooperation is very important.Australia and Indonesia co-chair the Bali process, which is the regional institution through which, together with the countries of South-East Asia and the Pacific, we deal with these matters on a regional basis. Earlier this year, then Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda and I co-chaired, for the first time in a number of years, the Bali process at ministerial level. Of course, so far as our relationship and our cooperation with Indonesia is concerned, Hassan Wirajuda and I brought into force the Lombok Treaty between Australia and Indonesia when we signed it in Perth in February 2008. The Lombok Treaty, of course, refers to cooperation between Australia and Indonesia on people smuggling, people trafficking and people movement.As members would be aware, in recent times the Prime Minister and President Yudhoyono, as well as former Foreign Minister Wirajuda and I, have had discussions about what further cooperation there can be between Australia and Indonesia to confront this heightened challenge. It is a heightened challenge in which we now see the potential for large numbers of people to move from Sri Lanka as a result of the civil war there and also as a consequence of what is very clearly now the case of people smugglers using heightened techniques and different and better efforts to avoid disruption and secure their objectives. The government has made it very clear that we are in discussions with Indonesian officials underneath the umbrella of the Lombok Treaty and, effectively, the Bali process to see what else we can do to address this problem.We are in discussions with Indonesia over how we can be of assistance in terms of greater information sharing, greater intelligence sharing, and how we can work more closely so far as disruption of people-smuggling efforts are concerned within Indonesian waters and generally. We are also in discussions with Indonesia about what more we can do to be of assistance to Indonesia when it comes to the detention of asylum seekers on Indonesian territory, the processing of asylum seekers on Indonesian territory through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and also the assistance of the International Organisation for Migration, and how Australia can be of greater assistance for settlement and resettlement purposes.These endeavours are not new. As the Prime Minister referred to earlier, it is the case that Australia and Indonesia have cooperated for a number of years, and the previous government in the end worked closely with Indonesia on these matters. For example, when it comes to detention facilities within Indonesia, the previous government, as has the current government, provided assistance to Indonesia for detention centres and to improve the facilities available for detention in Indonesia. It is also the case that both the current government and the predecessor government have worked closely with Indonesian agencies so far as disruption is concerned. I have made it clear, as has the government, that we are open to further assistance to Indonesia so far as detention centres and the facilities and conditions available in detention centres are concerned. I might make the point that today my colleague the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner, is in Indonesia on his way back from Bratislava from the NATO and ISAF meeting. He will be in discussions with the Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security, Minister Suyanto, and we are hopeful that, at the APEC meeting in Singapore in the middle of November, officials will be able to report to the Prime Minister and President Yudhoyono as to progress made on these fronts.There are some particular matters of interest which I would like draw to the House's attention. There is, of course, interest in the Oceanic Viking. My most recent advice is that the Oceanic Viking is currently at an anchorage point some 10 nautical miles off the coast of Indonesia and is in discussion with Indonesian officials, including officials on an Indonesian vessel near the Oceanic Viking, as to the disembarkation of the 78 asylum seekers on board the Oceanic Viking onto Indonesian soil. This will be the subject of ongoing and continuing discussions between Australian and Indonesian officials, but at this stage I am confident that those arrangements will be effected in the course of the day and we certainly look forward very much to a smooth, orderly and appropriate transfer of those asylum seekers from the Oceanic Viking to Indonesian territory.I have also seen suggestions that some detainees or asylum seekers in the Tanjung Pinang detention centre may have been badly treated. I welcome very much the fact that Indonesian police have indicated they are investigating those matters. Australia would, of course, very much want for any asylum seeker held in detention in Indonesia to be treated appropriately. If any serious allegations are made then they need to be investigated by the appropriate authorities. The Indonesian police have indicated that is occurring. I do make the point that detention centres in Indonesia, including the Tanjung Pinang detention centre, on which the previous government and the current government have expended funds to assist in the improvement of facilities, is subject to visits by the International Organisation for Migration and subject to access by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.I conclude by making this point: the theme of the questions from the Leader of the Opposition through question time has been that the only issue relevant, in the Leader of the Opposition's mind, is the consequences of the government change in policy in this area. I simply make the point to the House this Monday, as I did last Monday - and the response has been deafening in its silence - if the thesis of the opposition is that it is the changes made by the government to immigration and refugee matters that is the cause of the current difficulties, which our entire region faces, then simply tell us which ones you would change. Would you see women and children behind razor wire in Baxter again? Would you see the reintroduction of temporary protection visas? Would you see processing occurring in the Pacific through Nauru or Manus Island? All the Leader of the Opposition has to do is to simply indicate to the House and to the Australian parliament which of these changes he would propose to reintroduce.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. As far as the specific arrangements concerning the Oceanic Viking are concerned, I would draw her attention to the remarks just made by the Foreign Minister to the House. In terms of the processes involved in the decision making about where the vessel would dock and to whom asylum seekers would then be provided into the care of, those are matters which have obviously occurred in the government, but by which agencies within the government and by which officers, I am unaware. Our obligation with our friends in Indonesia is to work in a clear and practical way, and we have done so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and for his ongoing interest in infrastructure development. Indeed, I welcome the report that was released today by the Business Council of Australia because what it does is remind me and the Australian people that the Rudd government and the business community are talking the same language. Both of us recognise the importance of infrastructure development to our future economic prosperity. Indeed, infrastructure investment has been important in the short-term in insulating the Australian economy from the worst of the impacts of the global financial crisis. That was emphasised also in a report released just last week by the Australian Constructors Association and the Australian Industry Group. The president of the ACA, Wal King, said:Encouragingly, the survey results indicate that the Government's infrastructure stimulus measures and the number of large government-supported programs in the pipeline have avoided a larger downturn in activity.Importantly, the results indicate that infrastructure work will remain at high levels. Indeed, 70 per cent of the government stimulus package is in infrastructure. That includes rail and road but it also includes the initial $4.7 billion investment in the National Broadband Network, the $3.5 billion investment in energy infrastructure through the Clean Energy Initiative, the $16.2 billion investment in education infrastructure and the $6 billion investment in our housing infrastructure program. The largest growth in social housing in Australia's history is occurring right now.We also have a longer-term investment, when it comes to infrastructure development, with the $36 billion we have allocated in road and rail infrastructure through the Nation Building Program - some $9.3 billion is under way right now. We have completed 32 large-scale projects within our first two years in office. The last budget saw the first ever significant federal investment in ports with the new proposed port at Okajee in Western Australia and of course Darwin port. It also saw $4.6 billion invested in urban public transport, which is very important not just for dealing with our economic future but also for dealing with the challenge of climate change. We are spending more on rail infrastructure in just 12 months than the previous government spent in 12 long years. During the Howard years, public investment in the nation's infrastructure, as a proportion of national income, fell by close to 20 per cent.But of course it is not just about investment; it is also about policy and regulatory reform. COAG has already approved nationally consistent public-private partnership guidelines. Infrastructure Australia is developing for COAG a national port strategy and a national freight strategy. COAG has already agreed to an integrated single-layer approvals process for major projects. The Australian Transport Council, in two weeks time, will be meeting to finalise the regulatory reform agenda that will go to COAG in December, creating a single national regulator for heavy vehicles, for rail and for maritime - a reform agenda too hard for over a century. We have been able to achieve it in just two years. We are re-engaging in cities policy through the creation of the Major Cities Unit. We look forward to continuing to work with the business community. We recognise that not everything has been done and that there is a lot more work to do, but we are getting on with the job. We have put in place a framework to ensure that infrastructure development will remain at the heart of the government's economic policy.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I always welcome questions from the member for Murray because she has been such a consistent participant in this debate, has she not, member for Kooyong? She has been so consistent in her principles on this matter, hasn't she, member for Kooyong? She has never changed her position on these matters, has she, member for Kooyong? No, not once: not last year, not when she said in response to the government's policies on the abolition of the Pacific Solution, 'Do you support this, member for Murray? 'I do, I do, I do.' But suddenly, roll the clock on 12 months, a few things then beckon: (1) the challenge to her position on the frontbench against the contingency that the Leader of the Opposition may no longer be with us -  - I was just passing my good wishes again to the member for Murray and welcoming her contribution to the debate. Mr Speaker, the member for Murray points to numbers. In this place, for the last week or so that this debate has been going on, I have said repeatedly that in the period of the Howard government, nearly 250 boats arrived in Australia carrying nearly 15,000 boat people. Can I say to those opposite: I have not heard anyone so far dispute any element of the accuracy of those numbers. So the member for Murray can slice and dice data as she so chooses; they are the facts. The second fact is this: in the period we have been in government, there have been around 40 boats that have arrived in this country with about 1,700 to 1,800 individuals. That is over a period of about two years. The Howard government was in office for about 12 years, with nearly 15,000 people on 250 boats.But what is this really about? It is about the Liberal Party deciding to play the asylum-seeker card because they see it is full of good politics for them. Whatever happened to the member for Wentworth campaigning in the seat of Wentworth on the Liberal-progressive side of the party? Gone, gone, gone - a million - as he is now seeking to pitch his message to the right wing of the party, where he hopes to save his leadership. He is saying to the right wing of the party, 'I hear your pain on asylum seekers.' I could ask, why doesn't he instead reserve his venom for those vile individuals who are people smugglers, rather than to mete it upon the victims of people smugglers, the asylum seekers themselves.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for his question, and I know that he is concerned about how the nation is preparing for the recovery and about the ability of constituents in his electorate to access new skills and new employment opportunities. We have seen in the past the consequences of skill shortages. We saw them under the Howard government and we saw what a decade of neglect of investment in skills development does. What we saw under the Howard government was skill shortages in many sectors of the economy. They had completely neglected, for example, the skill shortages in the child-care sector. They had completely neglected to prepare for the skills we would need as an ageing community and with growing demand in aged care. Perhaps worst of all, under the Howard government trade skills training and apprenticeships languished for a decade, with major skill shortages in a number of key sectors arising as a result.In contrast to this woeful decade of neglect and mismanagement, this government is planning for recovery by investing in skills and training. I draw the attention of the House once again to our $100 million Apprentice Kickstart package, an important initiative to get young people into apprenticeships; to make sure that a kid leaving school this year gets a chance this summer with an employer to gain valuable trade skills. The incentive for employers for taking on a trades apprentice has moved from $4,000 to $7,350. It is a kick start; it is time limited; it is deliberately there to get apprenticeships moving and to give kids leaving school this summer an opportunity. I know that those who are concerned about the fortunes of young people in their electorates and are preparing for a recovery are working with their local employers on this important program. In addition, that program provides $20 million for pre-apprenticeship programs to assist those young people who need literacy and numeracy skills development in order to access an apprenticeship.I would also draw the attention of the House to our $145 million Securing Australian Apprenticeships package. This is a package to help apprentices who find themselves out of a trade to get another opportunity. To date, over 23,000 claims have been paid under this initiative - that is, young people getting a new start having lost their employer during the days of the global recession. I think that is to be welcomed. Then, of course, we see 10 per cent of the contract labour hours of stimulus projects being labour hours for trainees and apprentices. The government has also established a national resource sector task force to coordinate the skills needs of our resource sector. We estimate that there are 630 Australian apprentices currently in training in the mining industry in Western Australia alone, but we know more needs to be done.Our Productivity Places Program is also playing a role for the skills needs of the resources sector. Of 5,700 Western Australian job seekers enrolled in our Productivity Places Program, 800 are in areas such as extractive industries, mining and civil construction. We have also provided funding through the relevant skills council to upskill workers in the mining sector, and that is supporting the upskilling of 150 existing workers. Our universities are also responding to our new policies and settings. Demand for engineering courses in 2009 increased for the fourth year in a row and is up by 10 per cent in response to demand from mining and construction. This is a government that is planning for recovery, making the necessary investments in skills and training now - a stark contrast to the decade of neglect under the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question and for his ongoing engagement with the infrastructure agenda. I do recall making that announcement. That was part of the $1.2 billion that the government committed to the Australian Rail Track Corporation as part of our economic stimulus package. It was for a range of projects right across the country, from the Kalgoorlie line to work in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, and last week we announced the engagement of some work up to the Acacia Ridge from the New South Wales border. Indeed, $290 million of it was for the Liverpool Range project, connecting, as part of the work we are doing in addition to that, $580 million of rail infrastructure in the Hunter. We are getting on with the job. The entire work of the ARTC will more than double the capacity on the Hunter Valley rail network. Two projects have already been completed since they were announced as part of the package - the Maitland to Branxton line, with the bidirectional signalling project being commissioned into operation in May; and the St Helier and Muswellbrook duplication, completed in August. Announced, commenced, completed. Other projects are under way, including the Ulan line, passing loops and duplication, and the Minimbah Bank third rail line.In relation to the new rail alignment over the Liverpool Range, I can advise the member that the ARTC is currently working with industry to agree on the scope and the commencement date of the project. The ARTC is developing a feasibility program to evaluate the best option for the Liverpool Range. The feasibility evaluation has already been submitted to the effected industry for their approval and support. This is a project about the ARTC cooperating with the private sector industry, working hand in hand. Indeed, the last meeting with industry was just one week ago. At that meeting they agreed in principle to move on to the next stage. This is an important new infrastructure project for raising productivity and that is why the ARTC's capital works program is planned in conjunction with the industry to meet their future capacity demands. I will keep the member informed on an ongoing basis about these discussions and about the important work which will take place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. The government is committed to returning the budget to surplus as quickly as possible in the wake of the global financial crisis and, in accordance with that goal, has adopted the objectives of offsetting all new spending and applying a cap of two per cent real increase to government spending from the time when the growth numbers return to trend to the time when the budget returns to surplus. As part of those objectives, the government has commenced the ordinary process of consideration of savings options earlier than normal - in fact, several months earlier than normal - as part of the preparation for the forthcoming budget.The government are open to considering opposition proposals and community proposals for savings initiatives in this area. We have already made very substantial cuts in spending in specific programs and indeed costs for running government in both the 2008 and the 2009 budgets. We are lectured on an almost daily basis by the opposition about the evils of deficits, the danger of debt, and yet never - not once in the course of this parliament - have we received any specific commitments or proposals from the opposition for savings initiatives that could increase the overall fiscal position, reduce deficit and reduce debt. Underneath all of the rhetoric thus far, we have had virtually nothing in the way of substantive proposals.I note that the opposition has put in place an expenditure review committee. This was announced with some fanfare on 30 July this year by my opposite number, Senator Coonan, who seemed to be under the impression that perhaps this was the first time an opposition had ever done anything of this kind - if you look at the ABC Radio transcript from when she announced it. Perhaps she has not done any research about what ERCs do and whether there have been ERCs in opposition before, but there certainly were ERCs when Labor was in opposition and those ERCs in fact did develop specific spending cut proposals and put them to the people at the election -  - It is probably fortunate for the opposition that I was not asked about their plan because it is a rather threadbare one, unfortunately. There are four motherhood statements in their purported plan, none of which include any specific savings initiatives. There is not a single savings initiative. So, to great fanfare a few weeks ago, they announced their -  - I am disappointed that the opposition do not wish to have their spending cut proposals discussed in the parliament. The fact that there is nothing there to discuss might be a significant impediment to having such a debate.The government is committed to returning the budget to surplus at the earliest opportunity. It has in place a specific set of criteria that will ensure that. In both the 2008 and the 2009 budgets very substantial savings initiatives were put in place, some of which are still to be approved by the Senate. So, if there is any credibility in the position and the posture being adopted by the opposition, they will pass the reductions in the private health insurance rebate that will save $9.5 billion over 10 years and help to return the budget to surplus.</DOC>

On that particular matter, I myself had no engagement. As to the involvement of other agencies or individuals within the government, I do not know.

 - Last week the government reintroduced the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation into the House of Representatives and it is due for debate this week. The government remains committed to passing this important legislation this year. We are anticipating that it will be voted on in the House in the week commencing November 19 and then passed through to the Senate. The reason the government remains committed to that time frame is that the science on climate change is clear. As one of the hottest and driest continents, Australia has a lot to lose and we cannot afford further delay.It was pleasing last week to see a cross-party meeting of members of parliament with Australian climate scientists. I would like to put on record our thanks to the members for Isaacs and Moore for organising that important meeting, which was an opportunity for parliamentarians to engage directly with Australian climate scientists to explore many of the important issues. In the lead-up to Copenhagen, the more countries that are moving forward the greater chance of a comprehensive international outcome. Passage of the CPRS legislation before Copenhagen will undoubtedly strengthen the government's capacity to contribute to an international outcome.The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme gets the balance right because it ensures that Australia can meet its emissions reduction targets in the most cost-effective way. By assisting emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industries and industries such as the coal sector, the scheme supports employment, particularly in important regions of this country, whilst underpinning investment certainty and the economy's transition to a low-pollution future. The CPRS also provides important assistance to electricity generators to maintain investor confidence and, importantly, provides for assistance to low- and middle-income households to help them adjust to these changes.As I indicated last week during question time, the government welcomes the coalition's proposals, but it is very important that those proposals be both fiscally and environmentally responsible and credible. Proposals that reduce the amount of permit revenue available by excluding sectors or giving them additional support will have fiscal and environmental implications. For example, the exclusion or the proposed exclusion by the coalition of coal methane emissions from the CPRS would have the effect, were it implemented, of pushing responsibility onto other industries to further reduce their emissions so that Australia could still meet its emissions reduction targets.So it is with interest that we await further explanation of these particular issues from the member for Groom, who is representing the opposition in the good faith negotiations with the government. The time to act on these issues is now. Therefore, I urge all members of this place - all parliamentarians - to support the good faith negotiations, to rise to the challenge of climate change and to get behind an outcome that is in the national interest and ensure a vote on this important legislation this year.</DOC>

 - Obviously the member is aware that I am not aware of the details of the particular case he raises. I know that on many occasions he has been prepared to raise cases with me on an individual basis outside the chamber. I offer that opportunity to him again on this occasion and am happy to discuss the details. He should be in no doubt as to the priority and commitment this government has to its veterans. Our commitment is as one with that of the previous government and from a funding perspective is in line with the commitments we made at the last election, which were extensive and were well supported by the veteran community. I am happy to discuss the individual's case.On the question of the provision of paperwork and the requirements to try and sort out the sorts of issues that have been known to both sides of the House with respect to some of the complexities around the system, this government, through an interdepartmental working group and work between the various agencies involved in the many needs of our veteran community, has made quite a lot of changes and undertaken initiatives to try to minimise the level of paperwork required. The former Minister for Veterans' Affairs would also know, with his extensive knowledge in this area, that we often deal with difficult situations around the paperwork in this area. I remind the House that just recently we dealt with a case in the public forum which, although entirely different to this, highlighted the fact that record keeping in this area is a complex thing. Issues around proof and administration are also complex and need to be taken into account to ensure that everyone gets their entitlements and that people are treated appropriately. I am happy to discuss this matter with him outside the chamber and to discuss those issues in some detail.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question, because I know he has a significant interest in this issue, as do his constituents in Far North Queensland. The fact is that dangerous climate change poses fundamental risks to Australia's environment and to our livelihood. These risks are increasingly well understood by experts, by scientists and by the Rudd government. Earlier this year I released Australia's biodiversity and climate change: a strategic assessment of the vulnerability of Australia's biodiversity to climate change. The report says:Biodiversity is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change _ Many of Australia's most valued and iconic natural areas, and the rich biodiversity they support, are among the most vulnerable to climate change. They include the Great Barrier Reef, south-western Western Australia, the Australian Alps, the Queensland Wet Tropics and the Kakadu wetlands.It goes on to say that we are already seeing changes that are consistent with climate change impacts. For example, fire regimes in southern Australia - which we have witnessed in their tragic consequences - have been changing. This is consistent with a drier and a hotter climate. We have seen eight mass bleaching events since 1979 on the Great Barrier Reef triggered by unusually high sea surface temperatures. The report also makes some alarming predictions about the ecological impact of dangerous climate change:_ for tropical rainforests, higher temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns  -  longer dry periods between intense rainfall events  -  will increase the probability that fires penetrate into rainforest vegetation.Freshwater fish species, the report says:_ are vulnerable to reductions in water flows and water quality and, in addition, have a limited capacity to migrate to new waterways.In a report I released -  -  - They are not interested in the hard science on climate change, which actually affects their communities, which they are incapable of acting on. - I repeat, in an important report, the Great Barrier Reef outlook report 2009, which I released last month, there was confirmation of significant threats to the reef. As we know, the Great Barrier Reef is one of Australia's and the world's great natural assets. It is worth some $6 billion a year and supports over 63,000 jobs in fishing, tourism, and cultural and recreational industries. Critically, a two-degree rise is expected to cause serious damage to the Great Barrier Reef, with experts predicting a shift from hard coral dominated reefs to seaweed dominated reefs. Worryingly, from the Institute of Marine Science, research shows us that calcification rates in large boulder corals have declined some 15.2 per cent throughout the Great Barrier Reef since 1990. This is absolutely unprecedented, at least in the past 400 years. So there are significant risks to our environment, risks to our economy, risks to our unique ecosystems and our biodiversity, risks to productive landscapes and risks to industries. Report after report sends these alarm bells well and truly ringing.That is why it is absolutely critical that Australia plays its part in reducing our own emissions. It is absolutely critical to recognise that we do not have any time to wait. The science is in and the risks are real and already very present. The only excuse for continuing climate change inaction, for continued delay, is if you do not accept the risks - if you continue to reject the evidence, if you continue to deny the science. If you do accept that Australia has so much to lose from dangerous climate change, then it follows that the sooner we take responsibility and transform our economy for a low-emissions future, the lower the costs and greater the benefits will be. That is what this government is bringing forward with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme -  - The fact is the opposition has never understood the significant impacts that dangerous climate change has on our environment, and that is self-evident from that interjection by the Manager of Opposition Business in the House. The government is committed to bringing forward a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, rolling out the largest energy efficiency program we have seen in Australia and acting decisively to address dangerous climate change. That is what Australia expects; that is what this government will deliver.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. It gives me an opportunity on Breast Cancer Day to add to the comments that the Prime Minister opened question time with and to give a little more detail and information about the support that the government has been providing to women to ensure that breast cancer can be diagnosed early. And of course the Prime Minister took the House through the importance of these initiatives given the prevalence of breast cancer across the country.What I think is important for us to recognise and take stock of on a day like today is that Australia actually has a very strong track record in managing breast cancer. The report released today by the Institute of Health and Welfare and the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre found that we have been making steady progress. I think that the Prime Minister might have mentioned one of the figures from this report. I think it is pretty impressive - and all members of this House can be proud of this effort by our researchers, scientists, health professionals and others - that between 1994 and 2006 the death rate from breast cancer fell by 27 per cent and the percentage of women living longer is also improving. We also now have a five-year survival rate of 87.8 per cent compared to 71.8 per cent in the mid-1980s. So, although this disease is very prevalent and still exacting a terrible toll on the community, we are winning in our challenge to reduce its impact and extend people's lives.The results are, I think, testament to the importance of the BreastScreen program, which receives more than $134 million annually from the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments. A recent expert report found that BreastScreen is one of the best cancer-screening programs in the world - not just in Australia. And it is not just something from one government. As Australians, we can be proud of having one of the best cancer-screening programs in the world.But it is important on a day like today to remind Australians, particularly Australian women who are in the target age group of 50 to 69, that they need to remember to get a mammogram every two years. We still do not have a majority of women in that age group taking advantage of that program. It is there and available for Australian women and we know we can improve outcomes if there is early detection of this disease.We are also providing our core funding of more than $13 million for the good work of the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre and we have invested more than $27 million through the NHMRC for grants connected with breast cancer research. Importantly, we are also supporting some special initiatives and programs of the National Breast Cancer Foundation, the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre and the Breast Cancer Network, including for the first time $2.5 million to involve over 100,000 women in the National Breast Cancer Foundation's community survey. This is going to give us a population-wide set of data and information, which we have never had before. It is something that I think will improve those figures even more in future years. Another $800,000 is going to the centre for programs to improve early detection and management of breast cancer in younger women, in Indigenous women and in men, who we know can also suffer from breast cancer.Breast Cancer Network Australia will also receive just over $1 million to continue the production, promotion and dissemination of breast cancer resource kits. I know many people in this House have provided to their constituents and used themselves the My Journey kit and the Hope &amp; Hurdles pack, something that has been very helpful for women when they go through the phases that the Prime Minister mentioned - the shock of diagnosis, coping with the treatment and, of course, recovery. So I would like to commend and congratulate the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre, the National Breast Cancer Foundation and the Breast Cancer Network for their continued excellence and service to the community.There is still much more work to be done, but with these sorts of initiatives added to the many that the Prime Minister mentioned, like the support for McGrath Foundation nurses, funding for external prostheses, the regional cancer centres and the digital mammography equipment that was funded in this year's budget, we can improve those statistics even further. So I encourage all members of this House and all Australians to continue to support this fight. I also again encourage women to remain aware of the risks for women in the key age group of 50 to 69 and to not put off getting a mammogram; it could save your life.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I am certainly pleased to highlight our funding for aged and community care in Western Australia and right across Australia. Over the next four years, funding for aged and community care will reach record levels of $44 billion, and the government is investing record amounts in aged and community care with more than $2.6 billion being invested in residential aged care in Western Australia over the next four years. Since the election of the Rudd government, operational residential aged-care beds in Western Australia have increased. Indeed, the latest aged-care approvals round saw a total of 1,544 new aged-care places for Western Australia. This consisted of 519 residential aged-care places and 1,025 community care places worth over $50 million in annual recurrent funding. In addition, over $10.5 million has been allocated in capital and community care grants to develop and support new services. - Those figures I outlined before bring the total of operational aged care places in Western Australia to more than 19,900. As I said to the House last week, with this government's commitment to health, hospital and aged-care reform, we have been going around the country speaking to many frontline health professionals about the future of our health and aged-care systems, an area that the coalition neglected whilst they were in government. We saw a severe lack of funding right across the sector when it comes to aged care. It is this government that has delivered record funding to aged care and delivered increased compliance when it comes to aged care. - As I said, this government has committed record amounts to aged care - $44 billion over the next four years. We have also recognised that, for the long term, we need to be providing the health, hospital and aged-care sectors for our ageing population, an area neglected by the coalition when they were in government. Alternatively, the Rudd government are committed to making sure we are having extensive consultations on the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report and, as we have said in the House many times, we are consulting with frontline health professionals around the country - areas which the coalition neglected time and time again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. He is a man who has devoted his life to education policy both in this parliament and in the days before this parliament. We are a government that wants to hear the voice of Australian principals. That is why in November we are inviting to the national parliament principals from right around the country - from primary schools, from secondary schools and from every school system; from metropolitan areas, from regional areas - to talk through the government's reform agenda for education. That reform agenda is an education revolution. We intend to have a conversation with principals about our new transparency measures, which will powerfully compare the circumstances of schools around the country, particularly schools serving similar student populations so when we see best practice we can share it and when we see problems we can act to make a difference.In terms of acting to make a difference, this is a government making an unprecedented level of investment in school education. For schools that need a helping hand, we are investing $1½ billion to assist schools in low SES communities, because we know that in this country educational underachievement and being from a poor household are very strictly correlated. We also know life does not need to be like that; we can make a difference for those children from poor households and we intend to. We also intend to make a difference to the quality of teacher education and interaction with students. We know the most important thing is the quality of interaction in classrooms between teachers and students. That is why we have embarked on reforms to bring high-achieving graduates to the classrooms that need them the most in disadvantaged schools, through our Teach for Australia policies. It is why we already have, in classrooms in parts of this country, a new scheme to pay the most highly accomplished teachers more to go to the classrooms that need them the most. And we are making huge investments in literacy and numeracy because we know if students do not get the foundation stones of learning then they will be left behind for the rest of their lives. We have also embarked on the biggest school modernisation program the nation has ever seen, as well as delivering a national curriculum around the country, with the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority well advanced on the national curriculum in the first four key subjects of maths, science, English and history.Given the breadth of our education revolution agenda and our respect for principals, we will be bringing them together in Canberra for a national conversation. This is an opportunity for those who care about education to come together to talk through the government's agenda for education and to talk through the future of Australian schooling. We understand that principals, who are on the front line every day, are the best people to come and advise national government on the rollout of our policies.There are those in this parliament who care passionately about the future of education. There are those in this parliament who have no policies and no plans. As we look across at the opposition, we unfortunately see an opposition with no stated policies on education and no plans for the nation's future. We inherited from them a schooling system where we could see that Australian education was starting to fall behind world standards and poor kids were finishing last. We are getting on with the job of an education revolution to make a difference to that. Unfortunately, the opposition cannot join us in this national conversation because they have got no policies and no plans for Australia's kids or Australia's future.</DOC>

 - I will go through the issues raised by the shadow minister. One was the issue of staff learning and development and the need to provide support in that area. There are a couple of things that need to be understood there. This is something that occurs within departments and within governments of all political persuasions. In fact, it is something that governments would generally see as something they should do. But I agree with the opposition that, when times are tough, you need to look at exactly what sort of priority you put on that. That is why under this government we have cut the level of spending with respect to that type of assistance within the department. Just to give some figures to the House, in 2008-09, departmental expenditure on learning and development was a total of $3.96 million; in 2007-08, $4.6 million; in 2006-07, $4.46 million; in 2005-06, $4.29 million. So on this occasion what we have got, again, is the opposition coming along and complaining about something that we are doing when, in fact, they did it more. That is on that general point.Another issue was raised, which I think is also important - that is, the support provided and the consultancy that was mentioned with respect to the sports carnival. I share your concern on that issue very deeply. From discussions with the department, I can assure you it will not be happening again. But do you know what? It has happened before. This is not the first sports carnival for staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is considered to be an important part of their team building, but I do not think it is something that should be subsidised by the department and I think $10,000 is way too much. Let us look back to 2007. - Although I do not want to detain the House any longer, I have more to respond to. I agree that $10,000 is too much. Actually, I think $20,000 would be way too much and, in fact, $30,000 would be pretty rich. If you go back to the 2007 sports carnival, which was when you were in government, the subsidisation effectively provided to that exercise was over $34,000.I will go to the final point of the shadow minister's question and the intervention of the member for Sturt - the last post. The circumstances with respect to the War Memorial are the same as they were under the previous government - that is, we provide a budget, there is an independent council of eminent Australians and they make decisions about what they do and how they do it with respect to the priorities of the memorial. I think that is a very important principle. I do not think that politicians should be telling them what they should be doing around a very important cultural institution. - And to the very point we are talking about here. I apologise to the House. Because I was so excited to get up and answer this question I did not get the right bit of paper with the specific details about what has happened with War Memorial funding over the last few years, but I can tell you that the effect of your efficiency dividend over the last few years is more than what has occurred with our efficiency dividend in the last two years.Let us go back to the last post. It was a choice made by the memorial council, and I have to say it is a choice that I support because I support their right to make those decisions. Let us not forget that sponsorship is not a new thing at the memorial. There are a range of galleries and other activities - conferences et cetera - at the memorial that are also sponsored. As I and I am sure many others are aware, the eternal flame is also sponsored. The eternal flame has been sponsored since 1988. The last sponsorship of the eternal flame was established in 2005. Who was in government then? For those who have not been to the War Memorial - and, by the sound of it, there are quite a few of you - there is a plaque beside the eternal flame that makes that clear.The ceremony will continue to be held in a dignified manner - of that there is no question. I have complete confidence in the War Memorial director and council to do that properly. The fact of the matter is that it is in line with what occurred under the previous government, of which many of you were in fact members.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Throsby for her question. Australia must not forget the fact that we are one of the hottest and driest continents on earth and therefore will feel the impact of climate change hardest and fastest of most continents on earth. As Treasury has reminded us also, the fact remains that early action on climate change is better for the economy than late action. It is also less costly. By reverse logic, and also consistent with our advice, if you defer action on climate change, the cost of adjustment to the economy becomes much greater later on.The release of the report of the House committee inquiry into climate change and environmental impacts on coastal communities represents an important contribution to the national debate on climate change. Uncontrolled climate change could see a global sea level rise of one metre or more by 2100 and more intense storms threatening coastal housing and infrastructure. The report notes that in New South Wales coastal flooding, erosion and hazards currently cost around $200 million a year. Furthermore, more than 200,000 buildings along the state's coast are vulnerable. If sea levels rose by 0.9 metres, 4,700 residential building lots along Lake Macquarie waterway foreshore alone would be inundated. In Queensland, coastal communities such as the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast are particularly vulnerable. With almost 250,000 vulnerable coastal buildings, Queensland is at the highest risk of all Australian states from projected sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion. In Victoria, more than 80,000 coastal buildings and infrastructure are at risk from the projected sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, including some 18,000 dwellings in the Western Port region alone, valued, I am advised, in the vicinity of some $2 billion. In the Northern Territory, some 900 coastal buildings, including harbourside and port facilities, are vulnerable. In South Australia, more than 60,000 buildings along the state's coast are likely to be at risk from sea level rise. In Tasmania, within the next 50 to 100 years, 21 per cent of Tasmania's coast is at risk of erosion and recession from the sea level rising, affecting 17,000 coastal buildings. -  - In Western Australia, more than 94,000 coastal buildings are at risk from projected sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion. Between Fremantle and Mandurah, an estimated 28,000 buildings and 641 kilometres of road are at risk from erosion due to sea level rising.An opposition member - Rubbish! - I find the interjections from those opposite quite remarkable. These warnings about coastal inundation of every state in Australia and the Territory are described by those opposite as 'rubbish'. We simply note carefully what the report has said. The fact is that Australia has more to lose through continued inaction on climate change than do our competitor economies. That is why the government is exerting every effort through this place to see the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which we would use to set Australia up for a lower carbon future. That is why the Australian government is equally active globally to secure a strong global agreement on climate change as well.I indicated last week that the bill will be reintroduced into the House. It will be debated in the House this week and voted on in the House in the week beginning Monday, 16 November. It will be introduced in the Senate immediately after the vote in the House and it will be voted on in the Senate in the week beginning 23 November.The government welcomes the negotiations which are underway between it and the opposition. I am pleased to hear from Minister Wong that negotiations have commenced and are proceeding in good faith. I would like to personally thank the member for Groom for his genuine efforts to engage with the government and to reach an outcome that will finally deliver action on climate change. The Leader of the Opposition has been right in his observations when he has said that the 'biggest element in the fight against climate change has to be an emissions trading scheme'. Furthermore, he was right when he said:_ our first-hand experience in implementing _ an emissions trading system would be of considerable assistance in our international discussions and negotiations aimed at achieving an effective global climate change agreement.As he said elsewhere:_ climate change is a fact, not a theory.Australia needs these good-faith negotiations to work to give business the certainty they need for the future. We need it for the national interest and we need it for business certainty and we also need it to ensure that the climate change outcome for Australia delivers a financially and economically responsible outcome but one which is equally environmentally credible. We therefore welcome the negotiations underway between government and opposition on this. We have brought these bills back to the parliament because it is the right thing to do, it is the responsible thing to do and it is in Australia's national interest that we do so as well.On the global front, those opposite and others will have noted recent statements by the Prime Minister of Denmark, Prime Minister Rasmussen, who delivered a speech in which he called on all leaders to increase their engagement in negotiations in the lead-up to Copenhagen over the next six weeks. To give immediate effect to this, Prime Minister Rasmussen, as chair of the Conference of Parties, has asked a number of leaders to work closely with him in the lead-up to Copenhagen. Prime Minister Rasmussen noted in his speech:Negotiations have been ongoing for almost two years and progress has been painfully slow. Clearly, at current speed, we will not make it in the remaining weeks.The leaders engaged by Prime Minister Rasmussen will conduct regular discussions in the lead-up to Copenhagen, focusing on delivering effective action on climate change. Leaders' engagement is critical to increase the political momentum around the world to delivering a decent outcome at Copenhagen, to capture commitments already made in an ambitious and comprehensive global agreement and to guide ongoing negotiations for the future as well.This is critical for Australia. Our national actions are important through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. That is why our negotiations with the member for Groom and the opposition are so important. Equally, and more importantly, global action through the negotiations in the lead-up to Copenhagen are fundamental to delivering a lower carbon future for the planet, because, as we have been warned today by this House committee report on coastal inundation, the real costs for Australia of continued inaction on climate change are deep and enduring and damaging to our economy and damaging to the nation's environment. It is time for national action and global action on climate change.</DOC>

 - On the first part of the question, if you were to try and ask me - and I thank the member for Murray for her question - as to the precise sequence of events, I cannot recall each step in that sequence of events. I honestly cannot. It was a fast-flowing series of events. As for the second part of the question, I simply refer the honourable member to the answer that I gave on this question yesterday. These are complex diplomatic negotiations and are occurring at multiple levels between the government and the government of Indonesia.Of course, in this connection, I notice a particular report in a national newspaper today about some of the tactics which may be driving opposition questions on this matter - particular tactics which perhaps derive from a report, mentioned in today's Australian, entitled 'Digging dirt'. - Absolutely, Mr Speaker. That is why I always welcome questions from the member for Murray and always welcome the wider environment in which she asks those questions, particularly given the fact that the document in question said:You don't get new stories by trying to change perceptions, you get them by reinforcing stereotypes _ - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I said in response to the member for Murray's question today and again yesterday, the precise sequence of events concerning the handling of this particular vessel I cannot recall in absolute detail - they were complex diplomatic negotiations. But I would hope that, in the member for Murray's long record of consistency on these questions, which extends through her parliamentary career and her deep and continuing commitment to the interests and fair treatment of asylum seekers, which has not undergone any change at all over time, she too if she were part of a government would also respond to appropriate distress signals which are given in accordance with international maritime law, given that the interests of Australians around the world lie in those conventions also being adhered to.I also wonder whether some of the stereotypes referred to in this note, which was part of the 'Digging dirt' document revealed in the Australian today, may have dealt with the stereotyping of asylum seekers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this very pressing issue. The government has consistently said that the costs of action on climate change are dwarfed by the costs of inaction. One industry that understands this is the insurance industry. An increase in the number of insurance claims will place significant pressure on the financial sector and may result in reduced insurance availability and increased premiums for those in vulnerable areas. The insurance industry understands that climate change is real and it understands that the community, business and government need to act. It is clear that insurance premiums and the availability of insurance will be affected if there is no action on climate change.The most obvious impact of climate change on the insurance sector will be the increase in property losses from extreme weather events. As the Business Roundtable on Climate Change has said, 19 out of the 20 largest property insurance losses in Australia since 1967 have been weather related. Anything that is insured, whether it be property, crops, livestock, business operations or human life, is vulnerable to weather related events. In its submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts, the Insurance Australia Group estimated that the value of property in Australia exposed to risk of land being inundated or eroded by rising sea levels ranged from $50 billion up to $150 billion. The member for Hume and others can make their jokes about building arks. This is the view of an industry which understands the impacts of climate change on Australia and understands the costs of not acting.The Climate Change Working Group of the United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative estimates that the weather related losses could grow to be as high as US$1 trillion in a single year by the year 2040, so the longer we wait for action on climate change the more it will cost and the worse its effects will be. That is why the government has a clear strategy to shift Australia to a low-carbon future with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which we are exerting every effort to have passed so we can start to address some of these looming costs for our nation and for individuals. There are some in the House and elsewhere who have attempted to peddle the false dichotomy that you can have action on climate change or you can act to support jobs. This is very much a false dichotomy. Many people would want us to believe that, but the opposite is the case.The truth is that the fight against climate change can also be an opportunity to create jobs: opportunities not just in green technologies, not just in alternative energy but also in areas which might not be so obvious even to the climate sceptic leader, the member for Tangney - areas like financial services. The opportunity for timely action by Australia gives us an opportunity in the financial services field. Last week I informed the House that Australia had been ranked second in the world in terms of global financial centres by the World Economic Forum, and this provides us with a great opportunity. We are committed to using this strength to position Australia as an early mover in the creation of new and significant markets, especially in relation to the trading of carbon credits.What are these actions predicated upon? They are predicated upon action. Further delays and further uncertainty provide a great obstacle to Australia capitalising on these opportunities. They provide an obstacle to us capitalising on the opportunity of being the carbon trading financial services hub of the Asia-Pacific region. This is a great opportunity for Australia, but further delay and further uncertainty are a great threat to that opportunity. Australia has before it two clear paths - action or delay. We are committed to action - action to combat climate change and action to create jobs and a new economy which adjusts to climate change.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for this important question and I know that as the local member for the affected communities he is deeply concerned about the job losses at Bridgestone Australia. The job losses here are as a result of the challenging global conditions we find ourselves in and the particularly challenging days we live in for the motor vehicle industry. As a result of those pressures, the Bridgestone tyre factory in Salisbury in South Australia has indicated that it will be closing, and our first concern, of course, is for the 600 workers and their families who will be affected by this closure by April next year.I advise the House, and of course the local member is aware of this - but I presume all members of the House would be interested - that all workers who are made redundant by Bridgestone Australia are eligible for employment assistance under the government's Automotive Industry Structural Adjustment Program. Under this program all workers who are made redundant will be eligible for immediate access to intensive employment services at the stream 3 level with a local Job Services Australia provider. Jobs Services Australia providers will help each worker develop a tailored Employment Pathway Plan to help them find another job as quickly as possible.The Australian government has allocated up to 600 training places to provide assistance to those workers through our Productivity Places Program. The Commonwealth government assistance to these workers will be worth an estimated $4.7 million. We are also working together with the South Australian government to ensure that this help is available immediately. I understand that Premier Rann has just announced an additional support of up to $1 million will be committed by the state government to assist these workers. My department and the South Australian department of employment met with the company on Monday this week to discuss services to the workers caught up in this closure. Onsite information and advice sessions will be available to workers to enable them to understand what their options are and to assist them to access new employment opportunities.Bridgestone's Adelaide plant is in one of the government's priority employment areas, and I know that the local member is well aware that we have declared the northern and western parts of Adelaide a priority employment area. That means that there is a local employment coordinator in that area. The job of that local employment coordinator is to work with my department and with the Bridgestone staff and to work on the ground coordinating help from agencies like Centrelink and Jobs Services Australia and training organisations. We obviously want to access the community resilience and the goodwill in the local community to assist these workers during this difficult period.As a government we believe in action in the face of what is a very challenging global outlook. The government's steadfast approach when challenged by the global recession has been to act, and act quickly. We acted to maintain confidence in Australian financial services and we acted to stimulate demand and to support jobs in the Australian economy. Of course, secondly, we have acted to invest in human capital and productive capacity for Australians in training and skills opportunities. Thirdly, we will always be there standing shoulder to shoulder with those workers who are affected by these economic pressures and, clearly, our thoughts and priorities now are on assisting these 600 workers at Bridgestone.</DOC>

 - As Prime Minister of the country, I accept responsibility for our policy on immigration. Our policy is one, as I described yesterday, which is tough and humane. We believe it is the right balance. We therefore believe it is the right approach to be absolutely hard-line with people smugglers and it is the right approach also to conform with our obligations under international law when it comes to dealing with asylum seekers. That is the right approach of a mainstream government in a mainstream country dealing with the challenge, which is a global challenge. As Prime Minister of the country, I accept full responsibility for the policy we have embraced as a government. It is consistent with the undertakings that we made to the Australian people prior to the last election and consistent also with the changes to policy which occurred subsequent to the election, which the member for Murray embraced in her statement of last year though she now chooses to try and distance herself from it.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Chisholm for her question because it goes to nation building for recovery and how we are doing better than most other countries in the world at present, despite having to deal with the worst economic global downturn in three quarters of a century, in part because the government took early and decisive action through our nation building for recovery program, our stimulus strategy and our investments in infrastructure. We have acted in a manner entirely consistent with the principles of conservative economic management by expanding the role of government when the private sector is in retreat and by contracting the role of government as the private sector recovers.Furthermore, as we have outlined in the budget, we have a clear-cut plan for returning the budget to surplus consistent with the disciplines which were articulated by the Treasurer at the time. As a result of this action Australia is doing better than most other economies in the world with the strongest economic growth, the second lowest unemployment, the lowest debt, the lowest deficit of the major advanced economies and the only one so far to have remained out of recession.Right now the government's nation building for recovery plan is rolling out projects right across the country. I would like to inform the House that the latest available data shows that 25,000 major projects have commenced across Australia including 10,000 projects under the National School Pride program, 8,000 projects under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, 36,000 repair and maintenance projects for social housing, 2,000 new units of social housing, 150 road black spot projects as well as 2,500 community infrastructure projects right across the country.We are also in the business of beginning to outline our arrangements for the National Broadband Network in Tasmania for three regional towns there. We also have large-scale projects in which we are investing such as some 60 road and rail projects worth $9.3 billion. In New South Wales there is the F5 widening in Sydney, the duplication of the Pacific Highway in northern New South Wales and the Hunter Valley rail track upgrade. In Victoria there is the upgrade of the Western Ring Road, completion of the Geelong Ring Road, and the upgrade of the rail track between Melbourne and Adelaide. In Queensland there is the Pacific Motorway upgrade and also the improvements on the Bruce Highway and the Ipswich Motorway. In WA there is the Great Northern Highway upgrade as well as the construction of the Bunbury Port Access Road and Outer Ring Road. In South Australia there are the Dukes Highway, the Northern Expressway and the Port Wakefield Road upgrades. In Tassie there is the Brighton Bypass upgrade and other targeted work on the Midland Highway. Up in the Territory there is the extension of Tiger Brennan Drive.These are all important infrastructure projects for the nation because they are all about building long-term productivity growth. We are on about nation building for recovery and nation building for the future because, according to the OECD, infrastructure measures have a multiplier of some 0.9, higher than for government consumption and transfer to household measures. That is why our stimulus package is supporting over 200,000 Australian jobs. It has helped make Australia the fastest growing of all the advanced economies despite the difficulties of the global economic recession. Also the stimulus has represented the difference between following other advanced economies into recession and Australia's unemployment going up by hundreds of thousands of people. The human and economic costs of that would have been formidable.Our stimulus has proven to have a positive effect in also supporting business confidence. I have good news for the House and I am sure those opposite would welcome today's good news as well. The National Australia Bank's quarterly business survey showed an increase in business confidence of 20 points. This is the highest level since early 2002. The NAB say in the survey:Not surprisingly, business judge the government's actions as having had a positive impact on their plans - net balance plus 12, with significantly larger impacts on construction - net balance plus 28, with even larger impacts on residential infrastructure as well as retail and as well as wholesale.Investing in infrastructure is an effective way of building our nation's long-term productive capacity. As I have said repeatedly, this government believes in building a big Australia, which means we have got to be out there building the infrastructure of tomorrow as well. As CEDA said some time ago, simply addressing the existing backlog of infrastructure investment could increase GDP by 0.8 per cent and reduce the CPI by 3.2 per cent. The BCA had some things to say about this in recent years as well. The BCA report in 2005, remember, in relation to the previous government said:There is at present no overarching stocktake, vision or strategy that enables governments to quantify, prioritise and deliver Australia's future infrastructure needs.Also let us not forget those 20 separate warnings from the Reserve Bank about infrastructure bottlenecks and skills constraints within the Australian economy - yet those opposite refused to take action, as if we were sleepwalking towards some of these major economic problems.That is why the government have acted. We are nation building for recovery, nation building for the future, creating jobs and small businesses and apprenticeships today while building the nation-building infrastructure our country needs for tomorrow, but, critically, also setting up the country for long-term economic growth through productivity growth by investing in these capacity constraints which have historically plagued our economy - building our infrastructure and building up our skills base, becoming the great economic powerhouse of the future that Australians expect this government to lead this country towards.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. I am pleased to get a question on infrastructure from that side of the House, because it has been over a year since we had a single question on any infrastructure from that side of the House. I am asked about the Bruce Highway and the investment in the Bruce Highway that this government is undertaking. The important initiative that we took in the budget was Cooroy to Curra, a road described by the shadow minister as the worst road in Australia. - I was asked about the Bruce Highway and I am responding about the Bruce Highway, because the fact is that this government has doubled road funding, quadrupled rail funding -  - The minister for infrastructure will resume his seat. - I was asked about infrastructure spending and I am happy to respond because it is in fact very unusual for those opposite to try and run the duplicitous argument that they. On the one hand, we are spending too much on infrastructure - there is too much debt - but, on the other hand we are not doing enough. That is the tenet of the document. Indeed, the shadow minister said at the doors this morning that nothing could take away from the fact that Labor 'is spending $5 billion less on road and rail than the coalition government had promised before the last election.'  He said that, instead of building more, we are actually building less. That is their argument. So now they are arguing that they would spend $5 billion more than they committed on road and rail transport infrastructure at the last election. What a joke. There is no person in the House who is more pleased to hear that than the finance minister, I assure you!The fact is that what they actually committed to AusLink 2 in the last election was $22.3 billion. They committed $22.3 billion, they ran around and made promises for $31 billion, and they want to argue against our infrastructure program, saying that we are spending too much. They say the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow finance minister will wind it back, but at the same time they are arguing we should spend more. You cannot have it both ways. You have to make up your mind what projects you support and what projects you would wind back, as the Leader of the Opposition has said he would do and as the shadow finance minister has said she would do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. Labor is investing in the National Broadband Network to help businesses and organisations improve their productivity within their work places and, indeed, beyond. But all technology brings with it some risks. That is why in June of this year the government launched the E-security Awareness Week. Members of the House will recall that during the last week of sittings in June I outlined to the House some of the precautions that we need to take in protecting our electronic communications. But I have to report, with some regret, that in spite of that not everyone learned the lessons of E-security Awareness Week.In today's Australian, in an article entitled 'Dig dirt, Turnbull office urges', it highlights the risks of electronic communications being leaked. You do not have to be Sherlock Holmes - with due respect to Matthew Franklin - to know that this email instructing coalition media advisers was about digging dirt because the subject line on the email was headed 'Digging Dirt' - nothing if not subtle, this one. This is no ordinary guide to dirt digging. The Liberal Party guide to dirt digging is no Lonely Planet-style digging-on-a-shoestring guide. This is the Encyclopaedia Britannica of dirt digging. It is a comprehensive, detailed, considered and targeted guide to digging dirt, to smearing your opponents in your own political interests. Like many on this side of the House, I shudder when I hear the three words together 'Malcolm Turnbull' and 'email'. But here is what the email said:While policy discussions are nice, the simple fact is that in opposition, the majority of our successful news stories are going to be ones which are a little quirky_According to the Australian:Malcolm Turnbull's office has been advising Coalition press secretaries to demonise special interest groups and attack public servants as fat cats.There we have it. The modern Liberal Party's core philosophy: don't worry about policy, just stick to dirt digging and scare campaigns. That is the core message of this approved email. That is the core message of the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. That is the core message of the modern Liberal Party: don't engage in the big policy debates like climate change, the economic recession response, telecommunications reform - just stick to digging dirt. But the opposition is digging itself into irrelevance because when you do not have any policies all you are left with is the dirty politics of fear and smear on every single issue, and dirty emails to spread them with.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the shadow minister for this question because what it enables me to say to the House is a point that needs to be made. It is that the Liberal Party in government talked about things to do with education - it just did not get anything done. It talked about transparency but never got anything done. It talked about a national curriculum but never got anything done. It talked about improving teacher quality but never got anything done. It talked about principal autonomy but never got anything done. The Liberal policy about education is no more than this: get a cheap line, make a cheap statement, see if you can get yourself in the newspaper. If you are really desperate, claim that there is a Maoist in a curriculum board - that was always a good one. Get yourself a run in the Australian newspaper; go home and look in the mirror and say to yourself 'job well done'.The problem for the Liberal Party about that approach to education, which is what they did for over 10 long years, is that it was all about them talking about themselves and not one bit of it - not one skerrick, not one minute of effort - was ever about the kids. That came last on their agenda: actually making a difference in Australian schools for Australian school children. We are a government that believes in getting things done, in the hard work necessary to drive the reforms in Australian schools that will make a difference for the kids. That is why transparency will be delivered at the start of next year. Transparency, so that we know what is happening in Australian schools. That is why a national curriculum is being developed and delivered. That is why we are driving reforms in teacher quality and school leadership. That is why we are already seeing the best of our teachers teaching in the disadvantaged classrooms that need them most. That is why we have got Teach for Australia to bring a new cohort of high performing graduates into teaching. That is why we have got HECS relief initiatives to bring maths and science specialists into teaching. That is why we have got a $1.5 billion partnership for disadvantaged schools.Now, it should amaze and disgust this House that when I became Minister for Education you could not get a list of disadvantaged schools in this country. -  - As I said, it should amaze and disgust this House that until we came to government it was not possible to get a list of disadvantaged schools in this country. If you sat in the chair of the minister for education and said, 'Can you get me a list? There's 9,500 schools in the country; get me a list of the 2,000 most disadvantaged ones,' it could not be done. And why? Because no-one who had ever sat in that chair as a Liberal minister for education had ever cared enough about disadvantage to ask.It was all about themselves. Not one minute of their time was ever spent driving a reform that would make a difference for Australian children. We know exactly what this Liberal Party is about courtesy of the e-mail from the Liberal leader's office. We know that this opposition is not about policy; it is about dirt-digging. The one thing we should actually remember, though, is that when they were in government, they were not about education policy; they were about inaction. They were about carrying on in public but not one thing that made a profound difference to the quality of school education got done.We will continue to drive the education revolution because we are about making a difference for Australian kids. And as part of that education revolution we will deliver the biggest school modernisation program in the nation's history. Over there, looking for their dirt, mired in filth, they can keep carrying on but parents and teachers around the country know that reforms that make a difference for Australian children are being implemented. They know that the biggest school modernisation program in this nation's history is making a difference for Australian kids. - I look forward to getting a question on education when the shadow minister, who bellows and yaps, has finally bothered to write a policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. On 16 November, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition will offer a national apology to more than half a million forgotten Australians and former child migrants - those more than half a million people who grew up without their families: their mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters. More than 500,000 children were deprived of their childhood for many reasons. Whether it was through child migration, the death of a parent, poverty or illness, these were events beyond their control and for so many there was no safety net to catch them. It meant that little children, even babies, were left alone to fend for themselves in institutions and in foster homes.For the most part, these were cold, loveless, authoritarian places, with no time at all for the exuberance and innocence of childhood; no time for the love or laughter and warmth of family life; no time to play, to eat healthy food or to get a decent education. Instead of school, for many of them of course there was menial, hard work, so that when they were released into the outside world, many of them could neither read nor write. Many of these children were subjected to emotional, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of those who had responsibility to care for them. Today, many of them continue to struggle as a result of their experiences, grappling with mental illness, homelessness, substance abuse, and educational and family relationship difficulties.On 16 November, together as a nation we will acknowledge their experiences and together apologise for their loss - the loss of identity, family, and, in the case of former child migrants, the loss of country. These are the children who grew up in children's homes, orphanages and other forms of out-of-home care between the 1920s and the late 1970s. They have become known as the forgotten Australians, and they also include the 7,000 people who arrived in Australia as children from the United Kingdom and Malta under historical migration schemes and who were also subsequently placed in homes and orphanages. We have had three unanimous Senate inquiries calling for an apology and I am very pleased at the way we have been able to work across the parliament to develop the proposals for the apology.I would particularly like to thank the members for Corio, Blaxland and Swan, as well as all the senators who have been involved in those inquiries over many years. I would like to acknowledge the very significant work done by former Democrat Senator Andrew Murray, who is heading the advisory committee alongside the interest groups. I would like to mention and thank the individuals involved: Ian Thwaites, from the Child Migrants Trust; Harold Haig, from the International Association of Former Child Migrants and Their Families; Caroline Carroll, from the Alliance for Forgotten Australians; and Leonie Sheedy, from the Care Leavers of Australia Network. All of these people - members, senators and these representatives - have been extremely helpful in making sure that we get this apology right.The apology will be delivered on behalf of all Australians at a special remembrance event in the Members Hall in Parliament House. It will then be tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate to enable all of us to contribute to the debate. It will make sure we put what has been a largely invisible period of our history on the record. It will acknowledge that what happened to these children was real and it was wrong. It will demonstrate our shared resolve to make sure that this never happens again.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question. Firstly, he is right to point to a recent statement by the Secretary of the Treasury concerning robust population projections for Australia's future. Our population is now about 22 million. The Treasury secretary projects a rise to 35 million, approximately, by mid-century. That is a very significant increase. Therefore, the impact on all categories of infrastructure will be great. That is in part why the government has been determined to engage in a debate about the future provision of infrastructure nationally, not to simply to pass the buck to the states on all categories of infrastructure. I will come to the question of hospitals in a minute.The infrastructure minister referred earlier to the contribution which the Commonwealth is making in relation to roads. Can I also refer to the investments we are now making in urban transport and urban rail. We are also making investments - for the first time, significantly - in the port infrastructure of the country. But beyond those categories of infrastructure there are of course the emerging needs for social infrastructure. One such area is education and making sure that we have the proper classrooms to accommodate our kids for the future, given this population growth, and that they are appropriately modernised.To go directly to the point which was raised by the honourable member: hospital infrastructure is an emerging need as well. He is right to point out the need in terms of population increase. Something he did not mention but I am sure he would readily concede is that the ageing of the population means there is going to be a huge burden on the hospital infrastructure of Australia. As part of the consultations that I am currently in with the minister for health, I visited the electorate of the member for Lyne and Port Macquarie Base Hospital. That was one clear case study of the sort of trend which the honourable member for Dickson points to - namely, hospitals are built with a given population assumption in mind and then there is a rapid increase in population. In this case it is an aged population, as people retire from Sydney to Port Macquarie and that region. Consequently, the issue is the sheer physicality of the infrastructure which is therefore needed to provide health services to that community. There is a gap already between design on the one hand, and the population and demographic assumptions behind that, and then, barely 15 years later - if I recall correctly - the current population pressures in the member for Lyne's part of New South Wales. They are plainly misaligned.The honourable member for Dickson then went to the question of how we manage this for the long-term future. That is why we are currently engaged in an extensive national consultation on the three strategic options which were put out there in the Bennett health reform commission report. The first concerns a partial takeover of funding responsibility for the nation's health system. The second is to take over in a staged way full funding responsibility for the health and hospital system. The third option is for that to be done simultaneously - a recommendation which is not embraced by the health reform commission itself.What we intend to do is complete our round of consultations on this. The Minister for Health and Ageing and I, so far, together have visited some 65 hospital and health communities around the country. Personally, I have visited some 15. The minister, together with the minister responsible for rural health and Indigenous health as well as the relevant parliamentary secretaries, has been attending these consultations, as have many government backbenchers. For the information of the House, we spent several hours discussing this in the caucus room today, as each of the caucus members reflected on the contributions from their individual areas and their consultations with GPs and with local hospitals - right across the country - and their responses particularly to the road-testing of the recommendations contained in the report.This is a major area of long-term social infrastructure need; therefore, the options are there contained in the report. The government's process is to road-test those options with those who actually deliver these services in regional areas, as we undertook in the Port Macquarie consultation that I referred to before, and we will then take proposals for the future to the states and territories on what options the government will then embrace. This is a major pressure on the country for the future, as is water infrastructure, as is school infrastructure and as is the proper planning of our cities. This government intends to be comprehensively in the business of nation building rather than abandoning the field, as our predecessors did for a decade.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know that, with her background in psychology, this is an issue she is particularly concerned about. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Chisholm who has worked for many years to bring to the attention of this House the need for us to act on this important issue of negative body image. Contrary to the views of some, we know that negative body image is not just some teenage fad which will pass by. It is something to take seriously. It is a serious issue affecting the health, the confidence and the productivity of thousands of Australians - in particular, young Australians - and it is an issue which this government intends to act upon. It is critical for us as a House to recognise that in an age of increased media, advertising, digital technology and plastic surgery, as the Prime Minister said earlier today, the pressures which may have existed for a long time have been turbocharged, and it is in the best interests of all of us to work in partnership to build the self-esteem, confidence and resilience of our young people.It is interesting to note that body image was the highest ranked concern amongst young people in Mission Australia's national survey of young Australians in 2007. At least 20 per cent of women who are underweight still believe they are overweight and are currently dieting. Between 70 and 76 per cent of Australian high school girls consistently chose an ideal figure which was considerably thinner than their own. It is not just for women - and young women - but increasingly we are seeing men come forward with the concerns of body image.The truth is there is no one simple solution, but that does not mean that this is an issue that governments can continue to ignore. The Victorian government took the first steps to walk towards a code of conduct, and I commend them for their work, but we know that the time has come for a national approach, which is why in March of this year this government appointed a national advisory group on body image to develop a national media and industry code of conduct. Today I was pleased to receive the report of this group, which includes the industry code of conduct on body image as well as national strategies to promote positive body image amongst young Australians. The code sets a standard of best practice for the industry using models of a healthy weight and of diverse weights, using realistic and natural images of people and disclosing when images have been digitally manipulated. There is a growing momentum from consumers, from the general public and from parents alike that enough is enough. We want to see more realistic images in our advertising - real images of diverse women - to sell products to diverse women.It is interesting to note that tomorrow the Women's Weekly will release for the first time an Australian magazine which will feature a cover and an article of a completely 'untouched' woman. It is Sarah Murdoch - no doubt she still scrubs up remarkably well - but this is a step that shows that the media is starting to recognise that the Australian public want real images and they want diverse images. It also shows that realistic images not only are healthy but can be beautiful and economically smart too.I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all of the members of the body image advisory group, particularly the chair, Ms Mia Freedman, the former editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, for the hard work they have put in and for the suggestions they have put to government, which we will now be considering and reporting back on early in the new year. I assure them, as well as this House and the Australian general public, that we will tackle this issue and finally give it the attention it deserves so that we can have strong, confident and resilient young Australians for the next generation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I outlined to the House yesterday some of the investment we have made when it comes to aged care in Western Australia. I will run through that again shortly, but can I again confirm that the situation we inherited was over a decade of neglect from the previous government, particularly when it comes to health, hospitals and aged care as well. Since coming into government, as I pointed out yesterday, we have seen record funding. Indeed, over the next four years, our funding for aged and community care will reach $44 billion.It is through ministers that the whole of the administration - departments, statutory bodies and agencies of one kind and another - is responsible to the Parliament _I draw your attention to the fact that this is a question about supplying assistance and facilities to aged people with dementia. It is wrong for the minister to raise issues either of the past or, more particularly, to read a diatribe of expenditure that is not materialised. Give the old people a go! - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was referring to the neglect of the previous government when it comes to aged care - over a decade of neglect. I note that the member for Sturt seems to be interjecting quite a lot. Perhaps we can recall the time when he was the Minister for Ageing. I think his only contribution was when he said he didn't like old people. That was the sole contribution he made.Let us get back to Western Australia. As I said, this government has invested record amounts in aged and community facilities -  - Since the election of the Rudd government, operational residential aged-care beds in Western Australia have increased by nearly 90 beds and community care places by more than 820. Indeed, the latest aged-care approvals round saw a total of 1,544 new aged-care places for Western Australia. It consisted of 519 residential aged-care places, as I pointed out yesterday - 414 were high care and 105 low care; and 1,025 community care places worth over $50 million in annual recurrent funding. This brings the total of operational aged-care places in Western Australia to more than 19,900, which is quite a considerable number.The member asked me generally about the aged-care approvals round and the action that this government was taking in terms of future provisions. I would like to remind the House that back in June I announced the results of the aged-care approvals round. Across the nation more than 10,000 new aged-care places were made available. That included another successful aged-care -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. We seem to be having interjections from a whole series of former ministers for ageing from the coalition, all of whom contributed to that neglect and did nothing in the time that they were there. - As I was saying, when we look at the aged-care approvals round, there were more than 10,000 places right across the country, which included more than 5,700 new residential aged-care places and over 4,699 community care places. The allocation was a mix of residential and community care places. We understand that people want to remain in their communities for as long as possible.When that aged-care approvals round was announced it was very pleasing to see some of the support from many members of the House. I would like to share that with members today. We have a variety of different comments that members made. The member for Hinkler said he was 'very pleased to see all of these allocations come in'. He said:Each of these places means more people will get the care they need, when and where they need it.We also had the member for Gippsland, when the ACAR came out -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker, I was merely quoting some from the coalition who were very supportive of our ACAR. One more, the member for McMillan, was very pleased about that, saying that it would 'guarantee long-term availability of appropriate care for the aged in an area of demonstrated need'. It was great to have that support from the coalition when it came to our latest aged-care approvals round. - As I was saying, I commend those coalition members who made very positive contributions to the aged-care approvals round. I conclude by repeating what I said yesterday about this government's National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission agenda. What we have been doing, as the Prime Minister referred to earlier, is consultations around the country about our future health, hospital and aged-care systems. Because all these areas were neglected by the previous government and we acknowledge there is a huge amount of work to be done, we have been engaging with front-line health professionals in relation to all these important issues. - Of course, all this is in contrast to the absolute lack of policies from the coalition in relation to health and aged care - no policies at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for the question. There has been bipartisan support for some time for the work of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. The meetings which concluded over the weekend had to deal with some very difficult scientific information and have resulted in some outcomes which are going to create some genuine challenges, in particular for the community of Port Lincoln. It is a very high-value fishery - in the order of $187 million - and we need to remember that, of that value, 99 per cent goes back in exports to Japan.The scientific information that confronted the commission at these meetings was that fish stocks have now got down to somewhere in the order of between three and eight per cent of their original unfished levels. There have been from time to time calls for unilateral action, and some people have argued that Australia should unilaterally either radically cut or completely stop and close the fishery. Given the migratory nature of southern bluefin tuna, this does not necessarily do anything for the species and simply creates a serious situation for our own industry without delivering any actual improvement. That is why there has always been the need for an international response, and I am pleased to say that on this occasion the commission was able to look at reductions in catch across all the members of the commission.This is the first time in some time that we have had that. There was good work done, which I think is important for the government to acknowledge, in 2006 by the then minister in addressing overcatch and making sure that henceforth there was much better compliance as well as a significant reduction at the time in the Japanese catch.What has happened to the reductions rate this time is that there has been a 25 per cent cut over the next two years. The 25 per cent cut applies to Australia and Japan and to other members of the fishery. There have been some reports which mistakenly have claimed that Japan did not take the full 25 per cent cut. Those claims are based on the fact that there was a subsequent agreement between New Zealand and Japan for a small transferring quota, which is why there is ultimately a different figure there in percentage terms. But the actual cut, aside from the agreement that was reached between New Zealand and Japan, finds Japan and Australia, as well as New Zealand, Korea and Taiwan - far and away the major players in the fishery - all taking 75 per cent of the previous rate, making a 25 per cent reduction over the next two years.This creates real challenges for the Port Lincoln community. Because the reduction is being done over the next two years, industry is now working through how much of the reduction it will take this year and how much it will take next year. We are working with industry on that issue, and the challenges for employment of people employed in that fishery will be able to be dealt with the full suite of government services once we have worked out the order in which industry will address these reductions.It is a difficult decision but one taken at a time when every alternative was worse. I am pleased that we are currently organising for the shadow minister to be able to receive a full briefing on the outcomes of the commission, but these decisions had to be taken and had to be taken internationally, when we had a major high-value fishery facing an alternative of potential total collapse.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. Let me make a first point about chaplaincies in general, including those which are funded under this program. As you know, many have existed prior to this program coming into operation and, in fact, in the state of Queensland go back to a time when I used to work in the Queensland government, back in the early nineties. They actually do a fantastic job -  -  - Let me come to the question about the future of this program. They do a fantastic job and, in many school communities where there is the unavailability of social workers or other forms of social support mechanisms, they actually are providing the glue which keeps school communities rolling. That is my experience of them. - I say to those opposite, before they interject in too partisan a fashion: chaplains existed in schools prior to them introducing this program. It might be a historically difficult fact for those opposite to grasp, but it is not exclusively an innovation of the previous government - far from it.Second, as far as the existing program is concerned, I am advised by the education minister that it runs also into next year. We are currently in the process of reviewing the program. I believe they are doing a fantastic job, and we will wait till we conclude the proper review processes concerning the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. He has always taken a keen interest in health issues and particularly the health reform agenda that the government is undertaking. The Rudd government has been committed, from its first days in office, to tackling Australia's chronic disease epidemic. It is why we have put so much effort and attention from our early days into our preventative health agenda, and it is why we are attempting to establish Australia's first National Preventive Health Agency. Just five days ago we had Liberal Party support to do just that; of course, why wouldn't we - this is a good initiative. I think nearly 20 members of this House spoke in support of the bill, in support of establishing the National Preventive Health Agency. It is all good news about investing more time, energy and focus on keeping people well for longer and out of hospital. In fact, the member for Dickson in this House said:The objective of preventative health measures to alleviate pressures on the public hospital system is rightly supported by both sides of politics.However, only five days later we see that the member for Dickson might support this measure in the House but the real health spokesperson, a senator from Western Australia, has now opposed it and directed the Liberal Party in the Senate to oppose this measure.Interestingly, in this House we heard rumours that the Liberal Party might be opposing this measure in the Senate. My office contacted the shadow minister's office, or the nominal shadow minister's office, to inquire about the Liberal Party's plans to amend the legislation. We were told that they did not know anything about it. When we had a copy of the motion that had been distributed in the Senate we again called the member for Dickson's office. His office still did not have any of the terms of the motion and did not know anything about it. It defies logic that after this was recommended by the 2020 conference, by the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission's interim and final reports, by the Prevention Taskforce's interim and final reports, when it was agreed to by COAG, by the Prime Minister, by all the premiers, including the Western Australian Liberal premier, that it was voted for in this House by the Liberal Party, in fact it was moved as a non-controversial bill to the Main Committee because there was so much agreement across the parliament that this was a good initiative.So what is actually going on? What has caused this sudden about-face? I have to confess that I smell a rat. That rat is not Senator Cormann sniffing around for Mr Dutton's job; that rat, I suspect, is the alcohol industry and the tobacco industry calling in their favours yet again. They are concerned about this: tobacco donations still being received by the Liberal Party, the distillers having written the alcopops policy for the Liberal Party for 12 months. Senator Cormann in the other place asked questions just before question time. His specific queries about this bill were, No.1, will the government make tobacco products more expensive; No. 2, will the government change alcohol taxation; and, No. 3, will the government impose restrictions on advertising for alcohol?These are legitimate questions in a reform debate. However, they are questions for the government; they are not questions for this agency. They will not be the remit of this agency; they are not good reasons for an opposition to suddenly decide to oppose important infrastructure to support preventative health measures across this country. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition and the actual, at least current, health spokesperson to stick with the position they had only five days ago and to command the respect that they should have from the Senate for this measure, and ask that their Liberal colleagues in the Senate pass this bill. It is all good news and it is an important reform. Until today we had absolutely no inkling that the Liberal Party would oppose such a sensible measure. It is about time Senator Cormann got called to account and the tobacco companies stopped writing your policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. My advice is that this was initially a search and rescue operation under the control of the Indonesian search and rescue authority. When a vessel with 78 passengers on board became distressed in the Indonesian search and rescue area, the Indonesian search and rescue authority sought assistance from Australia - that is, the authority sought assistance from Australia. Australia takes its search and rescue obligations seriously. We provided that assistance in accordance with international law and, in our own terms, our own safety of life at sea obligations. We take those obligations seriously. Are those opposite seriously suggesting that we should not?HMAS Armidale responded to that request for assistance. The passengers on board the distressed vessel were later transferred to the Oceanic Viking. Indonesia stated that the Oceanic Viking would proceed to shore in Indonesia to disembark the passengers at the port of Merak. I am advised that subsequently Indonesian officials advised that the Oceanic Viking should not come to the port of Merak due to shipping activity at the port and a shortage of available accommodation. Further, I am advised that the Indonesian authorities have now requested the Oceanic Viking to anchor on the eastern side of the island of Bintan, off the port of Kijang. Australian authorities have agreed with that request. The Australian government is working closely with Indonesian authorities to facilitate the safe transfer of passengers to land. That is my broad understanding of the sequence of events.Furthermore, in response to the honourable member's question, could I say this. In my discussions with the President of Indonesia in Jakarta at the time of his inauguration he and I discussed the humanitarian circumstances which arose from this particular vessel, a vessel in distress at sea that was in the Indonesian search and rescue area. They, as I recall, did not have a vessel close by and made a request of Australia to assist. In the discussions with the Indonesian President arising from the humanitarian circumstances concerning this vessel, and the particular concerns about a child who at that stage was reported to be ill on that vessel, the Indonesians agreed to provide for that vessel to go ashore in Indonesia. That is the background to what occurred there. Subsequent discussions about precise embarkation points have been discussed between relevant officials of the two governments. As I said, they are of a diplomatic nature.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. He represents one of the Federation seats and therefore an Australian capital city, a city that will experience long-term population growth and will therefore need long-term, proper, city-wide planning. Last night I addressed the Business Council of Australia, an organisation with a strong interest in infrastructure reform and infrastructure investment. The government agrees with the business community that infrastructure reform and infrastructure investment are critical to addressing Australia's long-term economic needs (1) to boost productivity growth, (2) to tackle climate change and (3) to accommodate the 35 million we are advised will require support, the delivery of services, places to live and places to work by the time we reach mid-century, given that our current population stands at 22 million. When we reflect upon the particular implications for cities like Brisbane, this puts into stark relief the long-term planning that is necessary to ensure that our cities have the infrastructure and the planned infrastructure to meet those needs.Think about Sydney and Melbourne alone. We are advised that the populations of those two great cities will rise by mid-century to seven million each. Furthermore, the city of Brisbane will double its population to four million. The city of Perth will nearly triple its population to something like 3½ million. The other major cities of Australia are growing as well. As I have said before, I believe very much in a big Australia. But the time to prepare for that big Australia is now. We have to prepare for long-term infrastructure needs and infrastructure growth.This dovetails with the productivity needs of the Australian economy. The productivity needs of the Australian economy stare us in the face. We saw a decline in productivity growth over the period that those opposite were in government. We saw some 20 separate warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia about the problems of not investing in infrastructure or in skills and about the consequent impact of that on capacity constraints in the economy and on inflationary pressures as well. The challenges facing the government are these. How do you overcome a decade of neglect when it comes to productivity growth? What is necessary on the infrastructure front, the skills front and the planning front to deal with these challenges for the future?The government has been active across the last 18 months, since its election, with, first of all, the establishment of Infrastructure Australia; secondly, within that, the Major Cities Unit; thirdly, of course, the capital cities task force of COAG itself; fourthly, its engagement with the Australian Council of Local Government; fifthly, the first Commonwealth investments in urban public transport; sixthly, the first Commonwealth investments in urban water projects; and, seventhly, the biggest ever investment in social housing.The next step in this partnership with the states and territories of Australia is our proposal to develop the first national criteria for the future strategic planning of our largest cities. The Commonwealth will now consider linking all future infrastructure funding to the states and territories to compliance with these planning criteria. Those criteria would include such items as follow. First is the planned and sequenced land release for the future in order to meet the needs of our growing population. This will mean that developers would be able to provide more housing when people need it, making housing more affordable. Second is balancing infill and greenfield development. This will mean more opportunities for urban renewal in built-up areas and fewer dilapidated buildings in disused sites. Third is addressing climate change, meaning people have houses with greater energy efficiency and more public transport. Fourth is providing for nationally significant infrastructure, such as transport corridors, intermodal connections, and communications and utilities networks. This will mean people having greater job opportunities in cities and with higher levels of productivity. The final criterion is world standard design for our cities as well. We will also need new Commonwealth-state arrangements to jointly assess performance against these criteria and to advise on how these performance criteria can be improved in the future. We intend to take this forward through the Council of Australian Governments in 2010.A good example of where this becomes a very practical question indeed is the strategic planning needs of the people of Western Sydney. Western Sydney is already home to more than two million Australians, and it will rapidly expand as the population of Sydney itself grows to seven million by 2049. We want Western Sydney to be an even better place to live in the future, with better jobs, better infrastructure, better opportunities for local people as well as better housing and more affordable housing. That is the challenge for the future - and it will not happen just like that, with a snap of one's fingers; it has to be planned.To make that vision a reality we need to get on with long-term planning for Western Sydney, an area where the Australian government in the past has chosen to be absent from the field. That is not our approach. In areas like Penrith and Liverpool, there are other critical decisions in planning for their future infrastructure needs. There is also an opportunity to support growth outside the Sydney CBD, in other urban centres like Parramatta, Blacktown, Penrith, Campbelltown, Liverpool and Bankstown. Western Sydney will need new infrastructure investment, better transport links, hubs of innovation - such as our investment already in Macquarie University and the University of Western Sydney - and better health infrastructure, of the type we are now putting into Nepean Hospital and elsewhere.The point is this: with sound planning and greater public and private investment in infrastructure, we can make an area like Western Sydney a better place to live in the future, a better place to work in the future and, critically, a greater contributor to this nation's long-term productivity growth. So the government's strategy is clear. We cannot just wash our hands of the national planning needs of our largest cities -  -  - I hear the interjection from those opposite that we have washed our hands for two years! We have washed our hands for two years. What did they do for 12 years? Can we hear those clear statements of policy on our cities' infrastructure from those opposite for 12 years? What were they? I cannot recall a huge list. What I do remember is the former Treasurer standing in this place and saying: 'When it comes to urban water, don't look at us; that's a responsibility of the states. When you look at infrastructure in general, don't look at us; that's a responsibility of the states. Future needs of the hospitals? Don't look at us; look at the states.'The people of Australia expect us to rise to this challenge and partner with the states and territories to get on with the business of building the best cities for the future. The nation needs a productivity revolution to build the big Australia we all need and want for tomorrow.</DOC>

 - First of all, I say to the member for Curtin, who has been a most active participant in this debate, that as Prime Minister of Australia I take full responsibility for the immigration policy of Australia and its implementation. I also say that those opposite, I assume, take full responsibility - given they were members of the previous government - led by the member for Berowra, for 'children overboard', for kids behind razor wire and for all other such elements of the successful immigration policy on the part of those opposite! -  - Factually describing that the previous government was responsible for keeping kids behind razor wire, responsible for the Pacific solution and responsible also for the 'children overboard' affair are not matters of abuse; they are matters of historical record. I would suggest to those opposite that, as I am responsible in every respect for the immigration policy of Australia and its implementation, I assume that those opposite who sat in the cabinet of the previous government, share responsibility for the actions and decisions of the previous government as well. -  -  - I was asked what responsibility I had and the answer is that I accept full responsibility for the implementation of government policy on immigration. On the question of the actual physical treatment of asylum seekers in Indonesia, our cooperation extends in three directions: first, with the Indonesian government; secondly, with the UNHCR; and, thirdly, with the IOM, the International Organisation for Migration.Furthermore, I would say to those opposite that these are not unique cooperative arrangements when it comes to the physical accommodation of any asylum seekers who are in centres within Indonesia both under this government, including prospectively the 78, which are the subject of the honourable member's question, and who were similarly detained during the period of the previous government's office. The funding arrangements to support Indonesia bilaterally and to support the international agencies - the UNHCR and the IOM - go back at least to 2005 and involved expenditures by the previous government of several tens of millions of dollars. We have continued that practice and have been completely transparent about it.The conditions which pertain to the accommodation of individuals within centres in Indonesia are obviously subject to continued collaboration between the UNHCR, the IOM and the Indonesian authorities. We expect our friends in Indonesia to be constructive and fully engage with those discussions with the international agencies. We support them in their efforts, as I assume the previous government supported them in the period when they were in office.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question, because today's CPI figures show that inflation has moderated further in this country as the full impacts of the global recession continue to wash through the broader economy. Annual headline inflation moderated to 1.3 per cent - its lowest rate in 10 years. Today's outcome means that annual headline inflation has now decreased from five per cent one year ago to 1.3 per cent currently. Quarterly growth in the CPI of one per cent was largely driven by some unusually large increases in utility prices charged by state energy providers. These increases were responsible for almost half of the quarterly increase in the CPI.So overall we are continuing to see an easing of inflationary pressures in the economy and that reflects the fact that our economy is operating below capacity. Of course, as the RBA Governor has said on a number of occasions now, it is hard to say that there is too much growth in the economy. Private business investment does remain weak in the near term and unemployment is still expected to rise. That is why both fiscal and monetary policy support is being gradually and carefully withdrawn to support jobs until the recovery has taken hold. Fiscal stimulus has already peaked; it is already tapering away. The gradual withdrawal of stimulus will subtract from growth through 2010, making room for an expansion in private activity.Our job is to manage the withdrawal of stimulus carefully as the economy recovers. To abolish the stimulus overnight, as those opposite would do, would hurt small business, cost jobs and put our economic recovery at risk. The bulk of the stimulus that remains is critical nation-building infrastructure - investment in major highways, rail upgrades, ports, hospitals and schools. As I said before, it is short-term spending with lasting gains. This infrastructure investment will build future capacity - the key to ensuring strong growth with low inflation well into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Murray for her question. I assume she is not referring to a different vessel, but in fact to the Oceanic Viking. I say to the honourable member in response to the two parts of her question that the operational decision-making concerning this and all other matters concerning people-smuggling lie, as is normal, between the national security adviser in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the associated other government agencies and departments, including the Customs and Border Protection Service, Defence where necessary, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship where necessary, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as you would expect.As to the second part of the honourable member's question - as to the disembarkation of individuals from the Oceanic Viking to the port within Indonesia - I am sure that will be handled as appropriately as possible by Australian and Indonesian personnel in what will be a very difficult operation. Let us be frank about it. We are dealing with a complex, difficult and challenging set of circumstances. I have confidence that our men and women who are working in these professional agencies will discharge their professional responsibilities with the greatest degree of skill, tact and humanity that they can, but this is a very difficult situation.The government, as I have said before, is completely consistent in its approach to its overall attitude to immigration, which is that we will proceed with a hardline policy as far as people-smugglers are concerned, and a humane approach to asylum seekers. I say again to the member for Murray, as she has asked the question: were those opposite in power at the time that this vessel issued a distress call and we received a request under the relevant provisions of international maritime law, are they seriously suggesting that, having received a request from the Indonesian search and rescue authority, we should not have acted? -  - I hear the intervention from those opposite: 'They would not have come in the first place.' What happened with the 15,000 who did -  - In response to the two parts of the member for Murray's question, as I said in the first case we deal with these things through the coordination of the National Security Adviser, as you would expect. Secondly, on the question of the appropriate handling of persons in difficult circumstances, that will be done professionally and as humanely as possible, in difficult and trying circumstances, by our professional staff together with the Indonesians at the relevant port in Indonesia.I always reflect at times like this when those opposite ask these questions, out of what ultimate script book it comes. Of course we had a question in this place yesterday, addressed to the minister for infrastructure, about a particular script book being used on the part of those opposite. It actually went to the whole question of stereotyping. Those opposite, in their tactical handbook, which was deployed by critical advisers who are currently in attendance here in the chamber today -  -  - Again, I thank the member for Murray for her question. I assume that she has been guided by such things as: 'You don't get news stories by trying to change perceptions; you get them by reinforcing stereotypes.' It is not our document those opposite disseminated from the office of the Leader of the Opposition in recent days. I assume that that dictates the politics of this debate in this chamber as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It goes to the whole question: how do we build long-term productivity growth? That in turn goes to: how do we invest in productive infrastructure in the future as well? Having peaked in the June quarter, the government's stimulus strategy is rapidly rolling out projects across the country. Of the shovel-ready infrastructure projects, around 50,000 such projects, worth more than $25 billion, have already been approved. Most of the remaining stimulus is investment in infrastructure, which will expand, of course, the productive capacity of the economy. Now is the time for us all to be investing in our nation's future infrastructure needs, because the Australian economy is currently below capacity as a result of the global recession.Again, according to CEDA analysis, simply addressing existing backlogs in infrastructure investment could increase GDP by 0.8 per cent and reduce CPI by 3.2 per cent. That is why in the budget we were proud to announce $22 billion worth of investment in economic infrastructure through our nation-building funds. That is our approach when it comes to nation building for the future and nation building for recovery.I would note that I thought those opposite had a consistent policy when it came to infrastructure, but it seems, alas, they do not. The Leader of the Opposition, in the lead-up to the budget, said he wanted the government to fund infrastructure. In fact, he said:We have never argued about investing in infrastructure. We support investing in infrastructure _He went on to say:If you want to spend government money _ spend it on infrastructure.Then we had the shadow Treasurer say, not long after, that the infrastructure investments in the 2009-10 budget were 'terrific'. He said:_ for example take infrastructure. $22 billion on infrastructure, terrific, that's great.That was the shadow Treasurer on 13 May 2009. In fact, the shadow Treasurer went on to say that it is good for funding to be spent on infrastructure now. I quote him again:_ I think it's good to have some money spent on infrastructure now _But I inform the House that the coalition has once again changed its tune. Surprise, surprise, surprise! The masters of political opportunism, presumably driven also by the tactics unit in the leader's office, have in fact done a 180 on this one as well.I note that yesterday a report was tabled in the Senate by the Senate Economics References Committee on the government's economic stimulus initiatives. I understand that the majority report, delivered by the chair, Senator Eggleston, and supported by coalition members of the committee, called for the government to commission an urgent further report but then asked for that further report to provide recommendations on the feasibility of reducing, postponing, recalibrating the remaining discretionary funding on a project-by-project basis. This is very interesting indeed because it follows recent statements, I am advised, by the Leader of the Opposition - I think on Adelaide radio - where he said these infrastructure projects in which we are investing would now have to be reviewed. Am I right in also saying that Senator Coonan had something to say to the same effect?So now we have, on the one hand, them saying, 'Whatever you invest in infrastructure is terrific.' On the other hand, we now have them in the Senate saying, 'No, that's not. We should actually roll this back and we should actually reduce and postpone projects.' The Leader of the Opposition is saying they have to be reviewed one by one. Senator Coonan is saying the same. So here is the moment of truth: which ones? Which projects? Which states? What categories? Once again those opposite delay, as they have done in the debate with the Deputy Prime Minister on schools. They come in each day and say, through the member for Sturt, 'Oh, there's been some waste here. There's a problem there.' But, asked this question: which school project would they actually can, we hear a deafening silence. We hear it also in terms of the local government infrastructure projects which have been supported by the minister for infrastructure. But we see this here again in the statement adopted by the majority report in the Senate yesterday.The bottom line is that this nation has needed stimulus investment because we have managed to produce the fastest growing economy of the advanced economies in the last 12 months, the only major advanced economy not to have gone into recession, with the lowest debt, the lowest deficit. Can I say to those opposite: that is what we have achieved and we have achieved it because we have rolled our sleeves up and got into the business of supporting this economy and then, secondly, invested in long-term infrastructure and capacity building as well. That is our plan. We wait, as I am sure the finance minister does, for that list of projects which must come forth between now and election eve - whenever that might be - that you will be cutting. In which part of Australia will you be cutting those projects? Which road? Which school? Which university? Which hospital? Which medical research institute? Which projects? You can run but ultimately you cannot hide.</DOC>

 - I actually do not know how this question ever got past the tactics committee of the opposition, because buried within it is this assumption that somehow there is a capacity constraint within an Australian vessel, military or non-military - that somehow, if there are persons in distress at sea, we should not attend to all those persons. Is that what is being suggested here? Let us go to the facts of this matter, which are that the Indonesian search and rescue authority identified a distress vessel at sea within their search and rescue zone. Secondly, as I am advised, because there was no Indonesian vessel available, they asked for an Australian vessel to assist. Thirdly, Australia, consistent with its obligations under international maritime law, did so. Fourthly, I would believe that any Australian citizen who in the future ran the risk -  - Here he comes to try and clean up the wreckage. - I would remind the member of what the international legal obligations for countries such as Australia are under these circumstances. Under customary international law, all vessels have a duty to render assistance to a vessel in distress. This duty is reflected in article 98 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which both Australia and Indonesia are parties. Article 98 obliges a state to require the master of a ship flying its flag to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Australia has given effect to that obligation by dispatching HMAS Armidale to rendezvous with the distressed vessel. Australia's obligations are outlined in this respect through sections 265 and 317A of the Navigation Act 1912. It requires the master of a vessel to rescue persons in distress. That act does not apply to military vessels. Australian naval vessels give effect to rescues under ADF instructions and exercise the executive power under section 61 of the Australian Constitution.This is the legal framework within which we operate. It is the framework within which civilised mainstream countries around the world seek to operate. We do so because there are mutual obligations around the world and because Australians may also find themselves in distress at sea in various parts of the world where we need to call upon others to exercise reciprocal responsibilities. - The question went to the capacity of the Oceanic Viking. I can only go on the assumption that the person asking the question is also posing the question: if there were a capacity constraint within the Oceanic Viking, what should then have occurred with the distressed persons at sea? - We will act humanely, we will act effectively, we will act expeditiously when we receive calls from the Indonesian authorities, as we did in this case. - The honourable members interject, including the member for Curtin, who once again comes in on cue. She said in an earlier interview on such subject:We need a new approach _We need a lot more UN involvement in Indonesia _There has to be much more money go to the UNHCR _More countries need to take more people from the camps _It is vital there is an agreement with Indonesia. I agree we have to take more refugees _So said the member for Curtin in an earlier time. Consistency has never been their strongest suit.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. I note that last night I was at the BCA dinner in Sydney when the Prime Minister set out the government's vision for national leadership in the growth and development of our major cities. The government has indeed ended the exile of the urban policy area from the Commonwealth. There are three central themes to our urban policy framework: productivity, maximising the economic output of our cities and of employment growth; sustainability, making sure that planning in our cities is consistent with dealing with the great challenge of climate change; and liveability, making sure that we deal with issues such as the affordability of housing in our cities.Through COAG we will develop national criteria for the future strategic planning of our major cities - for the first time. This has been welcomed. The Urban Development Institute of Australia said:The Rudd government has committed to re-engaging with the engine room of the economy, our major capital cities. This is a good outcome for our cities and a great outcome for the nation.Indeed, the BCA board members who were there last night welcomed very much the Prime Minister's speech.This builds on the new cities initiatives implemented by this government over the last two years. The Rudd government have, in our first two budgets, delivered substantial investment for urban infrastructure projects, particularly in public transport and in water. This is about investment but it is also about economic reform. In two weeks time I will chair the Australian Transport Council, made up of the Commonwealth and the state and territory transport ministers. We will consider the next step in advancing our agenda for a single national regulator in heavy vehicles, in rail safety and in maritime. These are issues that have been discussed for over 100 years, with very little progress. If we can achieve this outcome that would be a major step forward.I am asked about ending the exile of the Commonwealth in recent times from the urban policy agenda. When we came to office, we came to office with a base of zero when it comes to cities policy. The coalition had an ideological objection to engagement with our cities. For over a decade the Howard-Costello government said issues which affect our cities, such as urban congestion and public transport, were not their problem. Indeed I am reminded that one of the first programs axed by the former government when they came to office was the Better Cities program. On 17 July 1996 the incoming Minister for Transport and Regional Development put out a release proudly declaring:The savings will also be achieved by ending the previous Labor government's discredited Better Cities program - a Coalition election policy commitment.He went on:The changes will involve the loss of approximately 220 jobs within the Department of Transport and Regional Development.When we came into office there was not a single urban planner in the entire Commonwealth Public Service - not one. They got rid of them all. In their release they went on to outline their ideological position, where they said:Current arrangements for Regional Development and Urban management overlap with State and local Governments which have their own urban infrastructure and local Government reform programs.There is no clear rationale or constitutional basis for Commonwealth involvement.That was their position when they came into office. To be fair to them, they delivered on that ideological commitment - totally. For 12 years they consistently implemented that ideological approach. This government has a different attitude. That is the policy that we are taking forward. The speech last night by the Prime Minister was a major step forward in re-engaging with our cities.</DOC>

 - The great thing about the Liberal Party is that they attack you from the right, they attack you from the left, they attack you from the front, they attack you from behind, but they never attack you consistently. It being Wednesday, it must be censure day, so we will be building up to a censure fairly soon. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that when it comes to the proper treatment of women and children he is right to point out the fact that our view, consistent with our immigration detention values, is that children are not under any circumstances to be held in an immigration detention centre in this country. 
Opposition members - In this country! - I am about to go on to the question of Indonesia. The Indonesian authorities have advised the government that women and children will be offered the option of staying in a house near the Tanjung Pinang detention facility. One of the reasons why that is the case is because we, together with the previous government, have been providing funding through the UNHCR and through the IOM to the Indonesian government to provide them with the capacity to construct appropriate facilities and to provide appropriate medical services as well to such individuals under these circumstances. That is the approach of the Australian government at home. That is what we are seeking to engage the Indonesians with abroad. - I say to the honourable gentleman opposite, as he continues to prosecute this attack -  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition intervenes as if there is some consistency in the attack being mounted by those opposite. Once again, when you look at the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, back in the Subiaco Post it is all 'gentle Julia'; she is all for a gentle solution. But when she is running a different line it is quite the reverse. We have the small-l liberal in Wentworth, the member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition, adopting a policy locally which is to the left on this issue but then adopting a posture sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right, depending on the circumstances not in the national debate but within the Liberal Party. Our policy is clear and we stand by it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. Yesterday the Minister for Infrastructure Transport, Regional Development and Local Government outlined to the House an email that was sent out by Senator Ronaldson's staff member and disseminated by the Leader of the Opposition's office, I understand, advising members of the Liberal Party to forget about policy and go for 'quirky' stories that relied on reinforcing stereotypes of fat cats and other targets for the Liberal Party. This kind of approach undermines the integrity of the electoral process, but sadly this is not an isolated instance.I have an interesting document here. The Leader of the Opposition will be pleased to know that it is not an email. The document is entitled A selective political analysis of the federal electorate of Ballarat and is by one Edmund Carew. It is very interesting because it contains detailed profiles - including some unflattering references to them - of local identities including local councillors. It is interesting that the then member for Ballarat now Senator Ronaldson had been member for Ballarat for five years but he still had to get a researcher to give him profiles of his local councillors. That tells you something.In this dossier, there is a four-page detailed profile of the then Labor candidate for Ballarat, Jenny Beacham. It contains some very interesting material including the names and occupations of her children, details of a recent death in the family of a close family member from serious illness, details from company searches of her business and other business activities, the names and addresses of directors of those companies, indications of how well business was doing and other such detailed personal information. It also has some rather interesting statements. For example, it quoted a statement from a newspaper in 1984 - more 10 years earlier - from Ms Beacham supporting the concept of redistribution. Then the report says to the Liberal Party and to now Senator Ronaldson, 'A comment that we should use if the scare of death or wealth taxes can be given a run.' It also notes that in response to a suggestion that Ms Beacham had organised a letter-writing campaign about something seven years earlier, 'If Beacham accuses us of a campaign, we can dredge this one up.' Appropriate language.But the most heinous crime that the former Labor candidate Jenny Beacham is accused of in this dossier is that when she visited South Africa during the first elections post apartheid she had lunch with Nelson Mandela. That tells you an awful lot about the Liberal Party. This is truly creepy stuff. But unfortunately it is part of a pattern. This was in 1994. I had been in this parliament one year. Gary Ablett senior was playing in the grand final for Geelong - that is how long ago it was. Shane Warne was about to take a hat-trick against the Poms in the Boxing Day test. - I have just been advised that the member for Mackellar is unopposed in her preselection to run around the track again. We can now see why. In fact, at the time I am referring to she was on the verge of becoming leader of the Liberal Party. There is a very important contemporary point here. The person involved in this dossier is the now Senator Ronaldson. He was then the member for Ballarat. He was then a relatively obscure junior frontbencher. He is now right at the very centre, right at the very heart, of the Turnbull leadership of the Liberal Party. He is the new Bill Heffernan. He is the hit man, the dirt man and the numbers man for the Leader of the Opposition. He is not some mad uncle, he is not the member for Mackellar; he is right at the heart of the team. This is a longstanding continuing pattern of skulduggery, spivery, scares and smears and it tells you everything about what the Liberal Party is.</DOC>

 - I am unaware of any such advice and can say to the Leader of the Opposition that President Yudhoyono has made no such comment to me at all. I will also say to the Leader of the Opposition what the President of Indonesia has said to me: that we all face a common people smuggling challenge. That is what the President of Indonesia has said. He is reflecting the mainstream view in Indonesia, in Malaysia and in various other regional countries, all of whom are cooperating through the Bali process. The Foreign Minister is actively engaged with his counterparts from across the region. That is the right and responsible approach; it is the right and responsible analysis.The Leader of the Opposition, if he was actually engaged in the facts of this matter as opposed to the politics of what he is seeking to prosecute, would understand three core points. One is that the total outflow globally of people from Sri Lanka in the last three years has gone through the roof because of civil disturbances there. The second is that the outflow from Iraq has similarly gone up because of problems of instability in Iraq. Thirdly, when it comes to Afghanistan, the same trend has occurred since 2005 as well. Furthermore, if you look at the numbers of asylum seekers - those seeking to be processed in various countries of the world - they nationally have broadly reflected these global numbers.That is what we are dealing with here in Australia as well. We have a policy which we have defended in the course of this debate because it is the right approach. It is the responsible approach. It is hardline on people smugglers. It seeks to be compassionate in relation to the circumstances of asylum seekers. That is the right approach under these difficult circumstances. Our approach, however, is consistent. Those, they cut and they trim each day depending on the politics of this debate because they are driven not by the policy of this but by the politics of the document which was circulated to the Australian newspaper yesterday, which says:In prosecuting debates of this type you do not get news stories by trying to change perceptions; you get them by reinforcing stereotypes.Quote unquote from the Liberal Party; quote unquote, from Senator Ronaldson's chief of staff after, apparently, a meeting between himself and the office of the Leader of the Opposition. - When it comes to dealing with the challenges of people smugglers we will tackle it globally through our global cooperation. We will do so regionally with our partners in Indonesia and in Malaysia - which on an earlier occasion, it seems, the member for Curtin was all for, but not recently. Also, we will tackle this problem through our own national means and the policy and resources that we have deployed.I remind those opposite that in recent times the amount we have invested in maritime surveillance - in air surveillance of the air-sea gap between ourselves and Indonesia - is considerably in excess of that which was put prosecuted under the previous government, because we take our responsibilities across this spectrum seriously. It is a difficult challenge. It will not go away because someone on the other side of politics chooses to wave a political magic wand and hope that this global problem, including a civil war which has been bloody and violent in Sri Lanka, simply did not occur. They are not interested in these facts. They are interested in the politics which were circulated in this document yesterday: the politics of stereotyping, the politics of dealing with special interest groups, the politics of not policy discussions, because they do not work, but the politics of fear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I did enjoy my visit to his electorate, and I note that under the Building the Education Revolution program his electorate is receiving $99 million for 139 projects in 119 schools. But there is a reason that the member for Braddon has asked me this question, and that is we are joined in the gallery today by students from Penguin Primary School, which I had the opportunity to visit when I visited his electorate. Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I have been given gifts on school visits in the past, but this is the first time that a school has ever given me handpainted gumboots with a penguin on either side. I would like to thank the students from Penguin Primary School for that very special gift - thank you very much.Penguin Primary School is benefiting from a $2.5 million project under the Building the Education Revolution program. They are having constructed a community learning centre - they are the right size, if that is what you are checking, Prime Minister; the students checked that and got the right size - and library extension. That is going to be great for their primary school. It is of course great news for Penguin because the residents in Penguin will be able to use that shared facility. At the same time, I was informed by the contractor who is building this new centre at Penguin Primary School that he expects the construction to support up to 135 jobs, so that is also great news for Penguin, great news for the electorate of Braddon.The sense of delight at Penguin is reflected right around the country in schools as they go about the job of constructing their Building the Education Revolution facilities and supporting local jobs. The serious side of this is that the opposition leader has said that he is committed to reviewing stimulus spending project by project. And then we have had fulsome acknowledgements from members opposite, most particularly the member for Flinders, who described the whole program, the $16 billion involved in this program, as a waste. And so we have the opposition that voted against this program - voted against every job, every project, every benefit to schools - now threatening, project by project, to review these and other stimulus measures.I call on the opposition once again to be honest with Australian students, their parents, teachers and school principals. The Leader of the Opposition and his shadow minister have an obligation to publish the list of school names that they say should not benefit under Building the Education Revolution. They cannot have it both ways; they cannot sign up to Senate committee reports calling for project by project reviews, they cannot go into the media saying that they are committed to project by project reviews, and then not complete the end of that process and tell school communities which of them would get nothing if the Liberal Party succeeded at the next election. It is something the Liberal Party should be honest about. Australian schools deserve to know the truth about what the Liberal Party has planned for their Building the Education Revolution projects.Once again, thank you to the kids from Penguin.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the interesting thing about the Leader of the Opposition's question is that in the three areas of policy change - which is kids behind razor wire, which is the Pacific solution, which is the Pacific solution on the part of this government and our repudiation of it -  -  - Mr Speaker, I say to those opposite: firstly, when we decided to abandon the Pacific solution, consistent with our pre-election commitments, the good old member for Murray stood up there and said, 'I do,' when we indicated that that was our future policy. When we undertook that change, that is precisely the response we got on the part of those opposite. Secondly, when we abolished temporary protection visas, we had the same failure on the part of those opposite to take an alternative view in the parliament when they had an opportunity to do so. I assume the member for Kooyong is not going to sit there and suggest that those opposite should reintroduce temporary protection visas. I know his position on this is constant, as are other members of conscience who sit on opposition benches, though they are somewhat smaller in number these days. Thirdly, on the question of children behind razor wire, I do not assume that those opposite are suggesting we move in that direction as well. My challenge to those opposite and to the Leader of the Opposition is: which of those three do you wish to bring back?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The Australian economy has performed better than most in the face of the global recession, but unquestionably there are still a number of Australians doing it tough. As a result of the global recession, for instance, in the last financial year there was an 11 per cent increase in bankruptcies and this represented the highest ever level of personal insolvency activity. The figures show the vast majority of bankruptcies relate to consumer debts and people involved with relatively few assets and little income, rather than unscrupulous debtors trying to avoid paying their debts. In these circumstances, it is more important than ever that our system is fair for both debtors but also creditors, and specifically the government recognises that small businesses are also doing it tough and they are entitled to be paid and they are entitled to be paid on time. Essentially our goal is to achieve the right balance.After extensive public consultation, this morning I introduced legislation to implement significant reforms to Australia's personal bankruptcies laws. The bill introduces a number of reforms, including increasing the minimum amount for which a creditor can petition from $2,000 to $10,000 - and I would add that this amount has not been increased since 1996. The proposed increase in the threshold will ensure that people are not bankrupted over relatively small debts and that bankruptcy is used as a last resort and not as a debt collection tool. I can indicate, for those who have expressed concern, that in the last financial year there were only 391 sequestration orders for an amount of less than $10,000. The vast majority were for a considerably larger amount than that.I can indicate also that the government proposes to increase the stay period from when a declaration of intent to file a debtor's petition is made. That will be increased from seven days to 28 days. The purpose is to give those in financial distress the opportunity to obtain advice and perhaps restructure their affairs, and it will also encourage creditors collectively to approach the debtor with a view to negotiating, perhaps, a debtor agreement. In that respect, the figures show that debt agreements provide for far more satisfactory outcomes all around. Last year, for instance, debt agreements returned an amount of about 60c in the dollar, as opposed to about 2c in respect of bankruptcies.While we have strengthened the protections for those facing unmanageable debts, we have also imposed, on the other side of the equation, good-faith obligations on them. Specifically, the bill strengthens the penalties for some offences, particularly those involving fraud or wilful failure to disclose income and assets. Finally, there are, all too frequently, reports that fees of insolvency practitioners considerably exceed the value of the funds that are recovered from debtors. The government is therefore including additional measures to introduce proportionality and greater accountability in respect of professional fees.These measures, we believe, strike an appropriate and fair balance and will achieve better outcomes for debtors and creditors. We also believe they will be beneficial in having a more effectively functioning economy generally.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question. He is right to reflect on the importance of that particular report and its recommendations concerning the impact of climate change on coastal inundation. I also note that he is concerned, obviously, about his own constituents, given the beautiful part of the Australian coastline which he is privileged to represent in this parliament.The Australian government commends the members of the House of Representatives inquiry, whose report Managing our coastal zone in a changing climate was tabled in parliament on Monday of this week. One of the government's first steps in advancing a national approach to coastal policy will be to investigate this House of Representatives inquiry. Government departments, including the Department of Climate Change and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, provided submissions to and appeared before the committee. The government will now carefully consider the findings of the inquiry.We have also worked closely with state and territory governments, coastal councils, natural resource management bodies and experts in developing a response to the inquiry. As part of this, I will be seeking the views of the Minister for Climate Change and Water about whether an inquiry into legal issues and climate change impacts on the coastal zone is appropriate and, if so, what would be the best way to take this forward. I will advise the member for Lyne further on the response of those consultations with the minister for climate change and of course with the Attorney-General.The Australian government is aware that there are considerable risks to assets in the coastal zone as a result of climate change and is currently undertaking a first pass national coastal vulnerability assessment. This assessment will be the first national mapping of the risks facing coastal communities around Australia. It will focus on residential housing at risk at both a state and local government level. The national coastal vulnerability assessment report is due for release later this year. This will be an important document to inform local communities. The government is also committed to holding a forum to develop a national coastal adaptation agenda after the release of the national coastal vulnerability assessment.Just last night I addressed the BCA about climate change and what it means for our planning systems. I announced that, in partnership with the state and territory governments and with the ALGA, we will now propose the development of national criteria for the future strategic planning of our major cities. I said that one of those criteria will focus on adapting to the risks of climate change, such as coastal inundation and more extreme weather events. Planning and management of coastal areas primarily rests with state governments, with many aspects of day-to-day planning decisions devolved to local governments as well. However, given the magnitude and spread of risk around the whole coastline, the Australian government will now actively work with states and territories through COAG to progress a national approach to adaptation to climate change.The release of the report of the House inquiry into climate change and the environmental impact on coastal communities reminds us of the significant impact that climate change will have on Australia if we fail to act. As an island continent, Australia is highly vulnerable to sea level rises resulting from climate change, with significant coastal erosion and damage to infrastructure anticipated. The fact is that Australia has more to lose through continued inaction on climate change than do our competitor economies. That is why the government is exerting every effort to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme - to set Australia up for a low-carbon future and to ensure that we reduce our own carbon pollution. That is why we must act nationally and why we must act globally.In summary, in response to the honourable member's question, we will come back to him once we have reached conclusions on the question of a further legal reference. Secondly, as far as adaptation measures are concerned, we are now actively working through the two mechanisms which I outlined in my response to the House just now. Thirdly, all of these are by way of adaptation measures; they are not about effective long-term mitigation measures to reduce actual greenhouse gas emissions. That is why a carbon pollution reduction scheme is necessary. It is also necessary for parallel action to be taken globally - hence the equal importance of what occurs in Copenhagen in December of this year. I thank the member for his question.</DOC>

 - I express my appreciation to the member for Leichhardt for his question on renewable energy. I was pleased to see him in attendance earlier this afternoon at a seminar currently underway in Parliament House, convened by the Treasurer and me, going to the question of baseload reliable energy in Far North Queensland. Renewable energy is one of the potential options in Far North Queensland. If we succeed on that front, we will have the capacity to pull through the further expansion of the resources sector in Australia, create sustainable jobs and perhaps also create opportunities to overcome the social blight that exists for the Indigenous community in the area by creating training and employment opportunities.In that context I was pleased to announce at that seminar the establishment of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy, the latest government down payment on trying to do whatever we can to facilitate the development of renewable energy in Australia. I remind the House that the government's program, which was also added to in the budget of this year, includes not only the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme but also the renewable energy target legislation which provides for us to obtain 20 per cent of our energy from renewable sources by 2020. That represents a $20 billion subsidy to the renewable energy sector by the Australian community.To pull through the renewable energy sector in Australia is not just a question of putting a price on carbon and establishing renewable energy targets; it is perhaps more importantly a question of facilitating the development of technology which goes to the potential commercial deployment of renewable energy. Therefore, the government's $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative includes a $1.5 billion Solar Flagships Program, $300 million for the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program, $15 million of the Second Generation Biofuels Program, $50 million for the Geothermal Drilling Program and a further $100 million for the Australian Solar Institute, which is headquartered in Newcastle.But if we are to push the renewable energy sector in Australia to assist in addressing climate change then we also need to create a hub of activity; hence, the announcement today of the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy. Why do we need such a centre? Firstly, it will be a one-stop shop to help commercialise renewable energy technologies and to facilitate the innovation chain. Secondly, it will represent a hub for renewable energy knowledge and support within the Australian government and, hopefully, create a collaborative effort with not only the private sector but also state and territory governments. The centre will have more than $560 million to manage and will take on the management of a number of existing renewable energy programs. It will also have $100 million in new funding and $50 million from the formerly proposed Clean Energy Program for new initiatives.I am pleased to advise that I have already had discussions with the office of the member for Groom with respect to our requirement to introduce legislation to parliament in November of this year for the purpose of trying to put in place the legislative framework that establishes ACRE in this calendar year. That is very important. I also want to put in place, side by side with that legislation, an interim advisory board. The first task of that interim advisory board will importantly be to make funding recommendations to me before the end of the year on the most prospective solar applications received under the original Renewable Energy Demonstration Program guidelines. The accelerated deployment, commercialisation and demonstration of renewable energy technologies through ACRE will clearly complement the government's investment in research with the Australian Solar Institute, and industrial scale demonstration, through the Solar Flagships Program.I am also pleased to advise the House today that the government has now decided on the design of the Solar Flagships Program. This is important because this is about baseload reliable energy from the renewable energy sector. Details can be found in the fact sheet that I released today at www.ret.gov.au. I commend the establishment of ACRE to the House and look to the support of the opposition for the facilitation of this legislation in November of this year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question and I also acknowledge the representatives of her community from Marysville who are with us today in the public gallery. I had the opportunity, together with the member for McEwen, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction, Bill Shorten, to meet with representatives of that community prior to question time today. It was a good meeting and we discussed some of the matters which have just been raised by the member for McEwen in her question.Marysville was appallingly hit in the bushfires, as we know. I am advised that 34 people died in Marysville and four in Narbethong. Around 530 properties and 95 per cent of the retail businesses in the commercial centre of Marysville were destroyed. The primary school, the retirement village, the community centre, the post office, the medical centre and the police station were also destroyed, as well as a large number of accommodation places, including conference facilities.I also thank the group for their presentation to me of a Wallangarra gum both as a token of their appreciation of support from various levels of government but also as a symbol of what they described to me as the toughness and resilience of their own community. I indicated to them that we would make arrangements to have that gum planted at the Lodge.On the specifics of the honourable member's question, which go to flexibility in recovery and reconstruction projects on the ground, I noted very carefully what the honourable member said. She was not critical of the level of support from the Commonwealth on these matters; what she is concerned about is the flexibility of the implementation of these programs on the ground. In the discussion we had before question time with representatives of the Marysville community I said the following - and I am happy to repeat it publicly: we need to find in the future a better balance in what is necessarily a highly centralised command and control system for dealing with the immediate occurrence of a natural disaster like a bushfire and the immediate aftermath. As you enter the recovery and reconstruction period, how do you then intelligently devolve greater responsibility and therefore flexibility to local communities to give effect to the best way of getting those communities back on their feet? That is a principle which I instinctively respond to.How do we actually make that work into the future? This is a much more complex task, as I am sure the member for McEwen will fully appreciate. But she asks in good faith if the government can now examine how this could be reflected for the purposes of learning into the future from natural disasters. My undertaking to her is that we will now undertake such an examination.In terms of the usefulness of using COAG to frame that for future purposes, my response to her on that question is that, once we have examined her proposal and, based on the principles that I have just reflected on behalf of the government, reached a conclusion on it, we will then advise her as to whether we think that can be properly advanced through the COAG process as well. The key, and I think the honourable member agrees with this, is that we have to get the balance right between the sorts of responses which are necessary early in dealing with these challenges and then the sorts of flexibilities which are necessary later on.The good representatives of Marysville, for example, gave me a very important fact before in their presentation to me, namely that a large number of the houses in Marysville are in fact owned by - and I use their term; I hope I do not offend anyone else by using this term - part-timers: those who reside in Melbourne but have a second house in Marysville itself. How do we therefore make it more possible for those houses to be rebuilt? That is a really tricky and practical challenge which we are now going to wrestle with and see if we can do anything more on, because the existing arrangements deal with owner-occupied dwellings and principal places of -  -  - I believe that the character of this discussion is very much a bipartisan one, and I would hope we can continue in that manner.The member for McEwen has rightly asked these questions. As we have sought to do since February of this year, we will continue to work with her on a bipartisan basis on the two specific proposals that she has put forward.Finally, I inform the House and the community which is here represented that, under the recovery plan, projects for Marysville and surrounds, as I am advised, that have been identified for funding support are as follows: $5.2 million for the Marysville community learning, health and recreation hub; $9.2 million for the restoration of Lake Mountain Alpine Resort as a major summer and winter tourist destination; redeveloping and upgrading Stevenson Falls, $2.6 million; reconstruction of Marysville police station, $2.4 million; construction of the Marysville Rebuilding Advisory Centre; development of the Marysville and Triangle urban design framework, $500,000; restoration of the Marysville caravan park, $500,000; construction of a Marysville skate park, $150,000; and construction of a Triangle walking and cycling trail connecting communities in the Marysville area. There are also other projects which I will not list.This, for the community at Marysville, is still very much the beginning. I have spoken about physical reconstruction. As the parliamentary secretary, the minister and the member indicated to me earlier today, as did members of the community themselves, with the emotional and psychological scars of what occurred back in February, the deep and difficult process of healing has barely begun. Our responsibility as a parliament, as both the Leader of the Opposition and I said at the time when this natural disaster occurred, is to maintain our solidarity with these communities brick by brick, house by house, school by school, community by community, until these communities are restored. That remains the commitment of the Australian government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for the question. Members may be unaware that yesterday the National Party got really mad. In a very cranky media release yesterday, the shadow minister for agriculture referred to the Productivity Commission review of the wheat export marketing arrangements. He was concerned about the timing of it and the timing of the first period for submissions coinciding with the wheat harvest. In his media release, he said: 'Anyone with even the slightest knowledge of the wheat industry in Australia' -  - As the shadow minister said, this is 'the busiest time of the year for grain growers with harvest in full swing.' He went on to say that anybody who would have called for this timetable, referring particularly to my office and the Productivity Commission, 'knows absolutely nothing about the wheat industry' and 'is devoid of any basic agriculture expertise.' The problem that the shadow minister did not refer to is that the Productivity Commission actually had no discretion as to the timing of this review. The legislation itself, under section 89, demands that the review be held -  -  - The time frame that is within section 89 of the act actually gives the Productivity Commission no discretion at all as to the timing. The question is, why is that time frame in the legislation? Why is it in section 89 in that way? When the bill was introduced in this House it did not have the tight time frame that demanded the submission period be right now. The reason it was changed was because of an amendment moved in the Senate by Senator Minchin and supported in the Senate by Senator Joyce. The only reason that time frame is in existence and the Productivity Commission has no discretion whatsoever on the timing is because of coalition amendments in the Senate that apparently, according to the shadow minister, would have been made by people 'devoid of any basic agriculture expertise.'While I will admit that the Liberal Party did play a constructive role generally in dealing with the wheat marketing issue, the Nationals would be better off getting the parents on the sideline to say, 'No, you are meant to be running that way.' Instead we have got a party that is still pining for the days when wheat farmers were told who they had to sell to, still pining for the days when there was no such thing as a climate scientist and still pining for the days before Menzies when there was no such thing as the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - The first thing I would say is that, as the Indonesian foreign minister said last night, in handling this matter Indonesia has an abundance of patience and so does Australia, because we intend to process this complex matter over a period of time and each of these circumstances is different, as they have been in the past.Therefore, to go to the second part of the honourable member's question, which goes to the decision-making processes of this government, as I said to the House yesterday on operational matters, that lies within the purchase of the National Security Adviser. As the honourable member would know, that individual served with distinction in the previous government as well. Furthermore, the National Security Adviser both periodically briefs my own office and periodically briefs other cabinet ministers. On the question of cabinet deliberations on that, I am sure they are being considered by relevant cabinet committees over an extended period of time, and not just in relation to the matters which have arisen in the case of this particular vessel.These are the normal processes of government. The National Security Adviser is doing a first-class job. He is an independent public servant who has served serve governments of both political persuasions with distinction.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the House would know, some 44 identified suspected illegal entry vehicles have come to Australian -  - vessels have come to this part of the world since this government has been in office. While the previous government was in office there were some 244 identified vessels. That brought something in the vicinity of 15,000 people to these shores. In fact, while the average over the years was about 20, in particular years under the previous government that number surged to nearly 100. This always is dependent upon various global factors at work, as any reasonable-minded member of this House would conclude. Each of these vessels involves its own individual complexity and must therefore be handled according to the circumstances at hand.The Oceanic Viking is a case of a humanitarian rescue of a boat in distress on the high seas with 78 passengers on board. This is not a boat that had reached the Australian mainland or our territorial waters; rather, it was a boat that became distressed in Indonesia's search and rescue area, and the Indonesian search and rescue authorities sought assistance from Australia. As Indonesia's foreign minister said last night, their first concern was humanitarian - humanitarian concern for passengers in distress.Since being contacted by the Indonesian government for assistance, the Australian government has made two fundamental decisions in relation to this case. First, we decided to rescue the vessel in distress, consistent with our obligations under international law - the safety of life at sea obligations under which Australian ships have an obligation to assist vessels that are not seaworthy. This duty is reflected, as I said to the House yesterday, in article 98 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which both Australia and Indonesia are parties. Australia takes its search and rescue obligations seriously. Therefore, the HMAS Armidale responded to the request for assistance. The passengers on board the distressed vessel were then transferred to the Oceanic Viking.The second decision was to direct the Oceanic Viking to deliver these people to Indonesia for processing. After the asylum seekers were rescued by an Australian vessel in Indonesia's search and rescue area, Australian and Indonesian agencies discussed the best practice for the people on board the vessel to be disembarked. The discussions included communications with the Indonesian search and rescue authority. Indonesia requested the Oceanic Viking to proceed to shore in Indonesia to disembark the passengers at the port of Merak. The Indonesian authorities have now requested the Oceanic Viking to anchor on the eastern side of the island of Bintan, off the port of Kijang. The Australian authorities have agreed to that request, as you would expect.The Australian government is working closely with the Indonesian authorities to facilitate the safe transfer of passengers to land. As the Indonesian foreign minister said quite correctly last night, Indonesia has an abundance of patience in handling these matters. Australia also has great patience in handling these complex matters. As the Indonesian foreign minister said last night, there are unique humanitarian circumstances pertaining to this particular vessel. He is right concerning those circumstances, which I have just described in some detail to the House. The Indonesian foreign minister is right to point out the fact that there is a three-part solution which is necessary here: one dealing with source countries, one dealing with transit countries and one dealing with so-called destination countries. He was right to say that Australia and Indonesia for some years have been working at all three levels. And the Indonesian foreign minister was right to point out the particular circumstances surrounding the proper treatment of children. I reflect carefully on what he had to say last night on that point and I refer also to the advice I provided to the House yesterday. Can I say, therefore, that the cooperation between the two governments on this matter is proceeding. It is a complex case, as there have been many such complex cases in the past. That is our approach to how we are handling this particular matter.It raises the question, however, as to what the alternative approach would be in this particular circumstance. There are only two alternatives to rescuing such a vessel by Australia. The first is a decision by a government not to rescue such a vessel - that the first alternative. The second is, if you have proceeded to rescue that vessel, do you take it to the nearest Indonesia port, as in this case, or do you bring it to Australia? What this government has done is straightforward. We have responded to an Indonesian request. We have proceeded to rescue this vessel consistent with the obligations of international law and, through consultation with the Indonesian authorities, proceeded to the nearest port in Indonesia. That is our approach.But what is the alternative approach? It can only be twofold. First, not to assist a vessel in distress - are those opposite suggesting that? - or, second, having interdicted such a vessel to support it and then bring it to Australia rather than to the nearest Indonesian port. They are the alternatives.So, Mr Speaker, what have those opposite said on policy on these matters? They have criticised us, as you know - from the right, from the left, from in front, from behind and from the centre, all possible when you do not have a policy or made much easier when you do not have a policy. But, on the specific operational characteristics of this, here is a question asked of one of those opposite, in fact my good friend the member for Murray. She was asked on 29 October:So do you believe Australia should take these people to Christmas Island?The answer from the forthright shadow minister:I don't have all the facts at hand, I have to say.We go then to Senator Abetz, who was asked:Where do you see these 78 Sri Lankans ending up, Australia or Indonesia?The answer from Senator Abetz:I am unfortunately not the government.Are we picking up a theme here? Then we have a question to the good old member for Warringah by his party confrere, at least in past times, Alan Jones, who asked him this:He - referring to the Prime Minister - could have brought them to Australia to Christmas Island. Are you saying that's what should have happened?The member for Warringah said:No, I'm not, but that's certainly what he's been doing up until now.Then Alan Jones asked:What are you saying should have happened?The member for Warringah replied:Well, I'm not the government.We have had a similar response from the Leader of the Opposition. But then we have the great source of all wisdom on these questions, the good old member for Berowra, who, as we know, has form on these questions. When he was asked only a few days ago:What would the opposition do differently to change the nature of things at the moment?What does the member for Berowra publicly recommend on the record?I have advised all my colleagues that -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. We have that man of constant principle, the member for Berowra, who has always maintained a consistency of line when it comes to asylum seekers over years past. The font of all advice on this, apart from Senator Ronaldson, is as follows:When asked this question, colleagues, by no means ever answer it.Never answer the question. What would you have done with a vessel in distress or, secondly, where would you have taken it - Indonesia, Christmas Island or the Australian mainland? They are the two questions which they do not want to answer.But I do love the member for Sturt almost as much as the member for Murray. He intervened in a particular way in an interview on 29 October, when he was asked:Would the opposition suggest that the government use force to remove these people or bring them to Australia, because what else could they do?Christopher Pyne, the member for Sturt, said:Well, look, Kieran, the opposition is not going to let the government off the hook by making ourselves and our position on these issues an excuse for Labor to try and distract the media and the public.There we go. I am happy to table what the member for Sturt says. It should always be immortalised in the Hansard. You never know when you will need it in the future. What we have here is an absolute pattern of opportunistic behaviour. On the key questions of what should happen with this vessel, how it should be handled, whether it should be rescued and, on top of that, where it should be taken, their answer, consistent with the advice of the good old member for Berowra, is: whatever you do, become a small target. Take no position.This government's policy is clear-cut when it comes to asylum seekers. I say to those opposite: their policy in response is as follows. Simply, in four words, their policy is: all fear, no solutions. Our approach is clear; theirs is driven by opportunism.The Indonesian and Australian governments recognise this is a complex challenge for the future. Oh, would that those opposite recognise that there are practical issues in this concern, which go to people's lives and the future integrity of the Australian migration system.</DOC>

 - Australian officials and Indonesian officials are processing this matter as a matter of course. As far as the presence of the vessel is concerned, I draw the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition's attention to one thing. It is as follows: the foreign affairs minister of Indonesia said last night of Indonesia: 'Indonesia has great patience in handling this matter' - so does Australia. That is the basis upon which the vessel's presence in the port will be considered in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question and particularly for his interest in nation-building infrastructure. The government is investing in nation-building infrastructure to support the economy now and also, importantly, to build capacity for the future. Something like 70 per cent of our economic stimulus is being invested in nation-building infrastructure. There is investment in highways, investment in ports such as the Port of Darwin, investment in rail upgrades, investment in hospitals and, of course, investment in schools. These investments are critical to support the economy now but they are also very important to build that capacity for the future so that when we grow we can grow sustainably without the type of capacity constraints that were so obvious during the latter period of the last government.The need for this investment now has been highlighted by Access Economics in the report today in their Investment Monitor where they talk about private investment activity remaining weak with just nine new projects added in the September quarter, the lowest on record. This is what Access Economics said: 'The outlook for investment spending, while improving, is also not yet firing on all cylinders. Non-residential building projects, in particular, remain lacklustre.' Of course that quote and their report underscore just how vital it is that the government maintain its stimulus investment in infrastructure. It is absolutely critical in terms of jobs now, absolutely critical for small business and absolutely critical to fill the gap which has been left by an absence of private demand. This government is absolutely committed to continuing with its nation-building program because it is essential to building productivity for the future.We are engaged in short-term spending with lasting gains, and I think it will pay to go through the elements of that program: $22 billion in critical capacity building road, rail, port, energy and education infrastructure announced in the last budget; a very significant boost to housing, particularly social housing, a key capacity constraint; investments from the minister for infrastructure across road, rail, ports and so on; and, of course, the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history. This is nation building and this is investment that is required now to support jobs, but it is also critical to leave a lasting legacy to build that capacity I was talking about before.Of course this investment is supported strongly not just by the business community but also by many prominent economists. Just today we had a statement issued by Mr Peter Anderson, Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said:This week's affirmation by the Prime Minister that investment in nation-building transport, logistics and human infrastructure are key elements in the Government's plan for managing the recovery is welcomed by industry _It is certainly not welcomed by those opposite but is welcomed by industry and recognised as the sensible economic plan this country needs, given the circumstances we face. Mr Anderson continues - and this goes to the nub of what the government is doing:Productivity growth means the economy will be stronger, the Commonwealth deficit can be paid off more quickly, living standards can rise without fueling inflation or job losses, and we can sustain population growth.That is in essence the objective of what the government is doing through putting in place its economic stimulus and through putting in place its nation-building infrastructure program. Of course, this is supported widely in our community. It is supported by all except by the Liberal and National parties who sit opposite. It was they who, when in government, ignored something like 20 separate warnings from the Reserve Bank about the fact that capacity constraints in the economy were fuelling inflation and putting upward pressure on interest rates. The end of that sorry tale was inflation at 16-year highs and 10 interest rate rises in a row - all under those opposite. This government is determined to investment in nation-building infrastructure, to deploy the spare capacity in the economy now to invest for the future and to make sure that we can have the sustainable jobs of the future with sustainable growth and with low inflation.</DOC>

 - I would say in response to the honourable member's question -  - I thank very much the member for Warringah for his question, as it comes straight out of the Ronaldson textbook. The Ronaldson textbook is about this: never debate policy; only get into stereotyping. That is what this debate is all about. The Ronaldson textbook also said - and remember it is issued by the office of the Leader of the Opposition - do not debate policy, because there is no good politics in it; only engage in stereotyping, because there is lots of good politics in that; and also target special interest groups and make good taxpayers angry. That is what the member for Warringah is on about in asking this question. - Mr Speaker, can I also respond to the honourable member's question by saying that the individuals who are on the Oceanic Viking are currently on the vessel waiting for processing onshore and their status has not been determined. The honourable member asks whether they are now going to be in receipt of Australian payments. They will not be in receipt of any payments from Australia, as I am advised. Further, I would say to the honourable member and those opposite that under the previous government temporary protection visa holders were able to access many welfare payments. These included: special benefit paid at the same rate as unemployment benefits; family tax benefit paid by the Howard government to holders of temporary protection visas; the baby bonus paid to temporary protection visa holders under the Howard government; the childcare benefit paid to temporary protection visa holders under the Howard government; the maternity immunisation allowance paid to temporary protection visa holders under the Howard government; and the double orphan pension and rent assistance payment paid to holders of temporary protection visas under the Howard government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. Earlier this week the apparently coalition-dominated Senate Economics Committee handed down a report arguing that the government should wind back its stimulus strategy prematurely. This proposition does not come as a complete surprise to the government, given that all along the Liberal Party and the National Party have seriously downplayed the threat of the global financial crisis and the global recession on the Australian economy. They have suggested that really this is all a bit of a minor affair. You may recall the leaflet that I showed the House some months ago - put out by the coalition - about Australia's economic circumstances, in which the global recession did not get a mention. There was no mention of the global financial crisis. All along the Liberal Party and the National Party have completely downplayed the threat to the Australian economy of the global financial crisis on the recession.Given that they oppose the government stimulus strategy - and it has become clearer and clearer that that strategy has worked; it has played a critical role in ensuring that growth remains in the positive in Australia and that our economic performance is well ahead of that of comparable developed nations, and thousands of jobs have been saved as a result and businesses have been able to remain open - the opposition has engaged in a desperate scramble for any kind of rationale to justify their position. The most recent version of this is to suggest that the stimulus is excessive, that it is creating inflationary pressures in the Australian economy and that it should be wound back. This position - as it became clear in the evidence put to the committee - is contrary to the position that is adopted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, it is contrary to the position that is adopted by the Australian Industry Group, it is contrary to the position adopted by the Western Australian Liberal government, it is contrary to the view of leading economists such as Rory Robertson and Craig James, and of course it is contrary to the view of the Australian Treasury.I would like to refer to three critical points here. First, although the Australian economy has outperformed comparable countries, economic growth for the financial year that concluded a few months ago was 0.6 per cent. Therefore the economy is still in a very fragile position and growth is well below normal levels. Second, the stimulus strategy that the government put in place is structured in such a way that it will decline gradually over time in any event and by the beginning of next year it will begin to subtract from growth, as the stimulus is gradually withdrawn. So what the opposition is suggesting should occur is actually designed to occur in a timely way.Thirdly, and most importantly, it is significant that the total amount of stimulus yet to come is roughly three per cent of all projected government spending for that record relevant time. We may well ask ourselves the question, 'Why is it that the opposition focuses, when talking about the impact of government spending, on the wider Australian economy?' They focus on three per cent, or thereabouts, of the total spending picture and ignore the remaining 97 per cent. We saw part of that answer in the Senate yesterday and we saw part of it earlier on. That is, they are calling for spending to be reduced at the same time as they are blocking government savings measures in the Senate. They are blocking the government's attempts to rein in the cost of the private health insurance rebate by imposing a means test on wealthy people benefiting from that rebate, and now they are seeking to line the pockets of wealthy medical specialists by blocking reform of the Medicare rebate with respect to cataract surgery.The answer to this conundrum is very simple. They do not want to cut government spending; they want to cut government spending that they do not like. That is really what they are on about. They want to cut back on spending that delivers jobs for ordinary working people in this country and they do not want to cut back on spending that delivers money to wealthy medical specialists and helps to subsidise the private health insurance of millionaires like the Leader of the Opposition. That is the true position of the opposition. They do not have a genuine policy position on government spending as it affects the economy. They are just opposed to government spending that helps working people. What they want to do is protect government spending that benefits wealthy people. That is the true position. That is why they are focused purely on the stimulus strategy of the government.The government rejects the view of the Senate committee. We believe that the stimulus approach is well timed, it is appropriate, it is critical to sustaining the Australian economy and - contrary to the view of the opposition - we believe it is crucial that we sustain jobs in the Australian economy, when it is still under very substantial stress. We believe it is crucial that we repair the damage to the budget in the medium term by getting significant savings measures, such as those being blocked by the opposition, through the parliament without further delay.</DOC>

 - They come from the right; they come from the left; they come from everywhere! This was the question which was asked yesterday which carries with it the implication that, because of the capacity of the Oceanic Viking, this country should not have honoured its obligations under international maritime law. That is exactly why it was asked. For the benefit of the honourable member for Farrer, the capacity of the Oceanic Viking is 75. On 18 September the Viking received an exemption to carry up to 120 people. Furthermore, the point is the Safety of Life at Sea - SOLAS - Convention provides that a ship's master can take on as many persons as required to save lives. That is what international law has to say; that is what international maritime law has to say. Can I say therefore to the honourable member, as she and the member for Warringah and the others all build up to -  - the inevitability of the -  - 'save Malcolm Turnbull' censure -  - motion today -  - The member for Hume then left the chamber.The member for Farrer then left the chamber. - The member for Farrer asked me about the capacity of the vessel, the number of people on board the vessel, and therefore whether it was capable of discharging its functions. My answer was that the capacity of the vessel was 75 and this was extended to 120 as of a decision of 18 September. I further said that the provisions under international maritime law made it such that, under the Safety of Life at Sea - SOLAS - Convention, masters of vessels may take on as many persons as required to save lives. The honourable member for Farrer was contending I was not answering the question. I would suggest, Mr Speaker, that that did constitute an answer to the question. She also went on to ask about the appropriate provisioning of the vessel in the future. Practical arrangements are in hand for all of that to occur in consultation with the Indonesian authorities, as you would expect. But I go back to my point, Mr Speaker: what's it all about? It is building up to the inevitability of another Thursday censure motion to defend the leadership of the Leader of the Liberal Party as he rallies the Right around the flag to save for another two weeks his leadership, given it has been under such systematic pressure and stress for such a long period of time. Unfortunately, Mr Speaker, the good citizens of Wentworth thought better of him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. It is a very important one. Of course I do not speculate about future movements in official interest rates but I cannot say the same for those opposite. In fact, yesterday we had the shadow minister for finance out there champing at the bit for a rate rise on Melbourne Cup Day. This is what she said:I think it's a pretty safe bet that the Reserve Bank would be looking very, very closely at a rise of 50 basis points on Melbourne Cup Day.So I think it is pretty clear that the Liberal Party have already put the champagne on ice, not for cup day but in the hope that rates go up by 50 basis points - and shame on them. Why would they consider celebrating an interest rate rise? Because they think somehow it is going to be to their political advantage whilst at the same time they are maintaining this ridiculous position that interest rates can somehow stay forever at a 50-year low. So that is the proposition: they want, on the one hand, to take political advantage out of a rate rise, which is never comfortable for anyone, but, on the other, they want to maintain that somehow, in a public policy sense, rates can stay forever at a 50-year low. Of course, as the governor has said, rates cannot stay at a 50-year low forever and that as the economy recovers they will begin to move. It is simply ridiculous for those opposite to claim that rates could stay at a 50-year low forever. It undermines any pretence that those opposite would have to any economic credibility at all.The Australian people are pretty sceptical about these claims because they have seen these sorts of claims from those opposite before. They know that the mob opposite have really got form when it comes to scare campaigns on interest rates. They well remember what they over there did back in 2004 when they went to that election campaign claiming that interest rates would stay 'at record lows' forever. At record lows was their claim, and the Australian people do remember what occurred after that fraud that they presented to the Australian people. Interest rates went up 10 times in a row and inflation went to a 16-year high. The Australian people well remember what drove that record high inflation, that 16-year high inflation. It was the inattention and inactivity of those opposite to deal with the capacity constraints in the Australian economy that were fuelling inflation. It was their refusal to invest in infrastructure, it was their refusal to invest in education, and the Australian people did pay a price for that refusal - 10 interest rate rises in a row.They were at it again this week. We had the member for Boothby on the doors saying, 'We now have evidence that a Labor government meant higher interest rates.' What planet does this guy live on? What planet could he possibly live on by going out there and saying there was evidence that a Labor government meant higher interest rates when interest rates are currently 350 basis points lower than they were when they were last in government? What hide they have. What front and what economic incompetence resides on that front bench, when interest rates are 350 basis points below their peak when they were last in power, when they did not invest in infrastructure and when they did not invest in education, to go around and pretend that they can somehow keep interest rates at 50-year lows.Those opposite have shredded any pretence of economic credibility. That is why we on this side of the House will continue to put in place responsible economic management, make sure that we carefully manage our stimulus - that it is carefully withdrawn as we go through next year - and make sure that we support jobs and small business in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - We all love questions from the good old member for Murray because the honourable member asks questions about internal government processes to look at how to deal with the challenges of migration policy across the spectrum and specifically refugee policies, asylum seeker policies and outflows from within the region and beyond the region in particular.This government has had a range of policy mechanisms within government at work on this since we assumed office nearly two years ago. What has changed in that period of time is that we have had since 2005 a range of new push factors from major source countries like Sri Lanka, Iraq and Afghanistan. As I said to those opposite when I recently ran through these figures, if in the last three years you have seen the numbers of asylum seekers from Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka go through the roof by between 50, 100, 150 or almost 200 per cent then all countries around the world are going to feel those push factors. We in Australia are no different.The member for Murray then implies within her question what sorts of responses will be developed by internal mechanisms within the government. One of those mechanisms concerns the proper use of the humanitarian agencies like the UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration, who are working with our government and the Indonesian government on the ground in Indonesia, as they have done for many years. The UNHCR is the organisation which the good old member for Murray says we should be doing more with as well. In fact, she said this morning, 'Surely the UNHCR can be engaged directly to work with these people whether they are on board or not.' This is the same member for Murray who said earlier this month that the UNHCR was 'corrupt'. She said:_ it in fact costs you more to bribe the UNHCR to look at your case and assess you for your asylum-seeking status than to pay a people-smuggler. - Mr Speaker, thank you for that multidimensional answer! I responded to the honourable member's question, which went to internal government processes in response to push factors around the world over a period of time, when they are established, and therefore their response to given developments over time. The content of my answer was that, since the government have been in for two years, we have had a range of internal mechanisms within the government that serve cabinet committees, that are internal to the bureaucracy, as you would expect, and that deal with a multiplicity of these challenges which come from time to time. That is the normal business of government. Part of the response, of course, which has been developed by officials, is what we should do over time to enhance our cooperation with the UNHCR and the IOM.I was simply drawing the honourable member for Murray's attention to the fact that, less than a month ago, in response to the question: 'So you're alleging corruption within the UNHCR?' she said on the record, 'Yes, I'm saying to you it's a well-known fact that in some UNHCR offices there is bribery and corruption.' Can I just say, if you are seeking to represent an alternative government of Australia and you are seeking to deal with international agencies cooperatively, that is probably not the best first thing to say. If you want to get on with them and you go out there and say, 'You're just all corrupt,' I think that is not actually a good way to go.Our response deals with the global factors which go to the push factors, the transit countries and, of course, countries of ultimate destination, and in dealing with this we are also dealing with the international agencies who are working with all of these countries on a continuing basis. The critical one is the UNHCR. When it comes to that which the member for Berowra dare not speak of - alternative policy - I simply pose the question to those opposite: how can you have an alternative policy if you think one of the principal agencies is corrupt and therefore cannot be worked with?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The member asked about two terrible terrorist attacks yesterday, that were reported overnight, in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Shortly before question time, I spoke to Pakistan's High Commissioner to Australia and relayed to him the government's condolences on the terrible loss that has occurred as a result of the attack in Peshawar, which was an attack upon innocent women and children in a marketplace. I expressed to him Australia's solidarity at a time of very difficult circumstances as far as Pakistan's security and economic and social circumstances are concerned. I relayed those condolences and that message of solidarity to the Pakistan high commissioner and asked him to relay that to Foreign Minister Qureshi. I know that sentiment will be shared by all members of the House. This was a terrible attack on women and children. The reason for the attack is no doubt because the government, the parliament and the people of Pakistan are taking a stand against extremism and terrorism in the North-West Frontier Province and on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. This is clearly directed at intimidating Pakistan and seeking to have it desist in its stand against terrorism.Australia is a foundation member of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan. Recently, at the United Nations General Assembly, the Prime Minister and I attended the leaders' summit of Friends of Democratic Pakistan, chaired by President Obama, where we made the point to Pakistan that we stood shoulder to shoulder with them. We have substantially increased our development assistance to Pakistan and have also substantially increased the assistance that we give to them for the training of their military and defence officers.The member also asked me about the terrorist attack in Afghanistan. This was of course an attack upon a UN residence, on UN officers in accommodation. Any attack upon the United Nations is absolutely contemptible. We relay to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon our contempt for this outrageous act and our condolences to the secretary-general and to all officials and employees of the United Nations, and we relay our sympathy to the families of the victims. It underlines a very important point often missed: the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan is a United Nations mandated force. The United Nations assistance mission in Afghanistan plays a vital role, together with the secretary-general's special representative, Kai Eide.They were terrible attacks. I know that the sentiments I have expressed will be shared by all members of the House. Any attack upon the United Nations is contemptible. Our support and sympathy goes to the United Nations today. The attack on innocent women and children in Pakistan is also an outrage. We express and send our condolences to Pakistan at this difficult time for them.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question on those matters which he has just referred to. Taking them in reverse order, the first was about supplies to the vessel. Yes, the vessel will be supplied. That is why we have arrangements already with Australian authorities, in cooperation with the Indonesians, to provide the necessary victualling and other supports for the vessel in question. Secondly, on the question of payments, because they currently have no status under Australian immigration law they are not receiving payments. Mr Speaker, the question was asked about payments to those on the vessel -  - The Leader of the Opposition is so desperate to get on with his censure motion that he now seeks to add to the questions he has just asked. The question he asked just now was: would I answer the question about cash payments to those on the vessel, and what I have said to those opposite is that they have no status under Australian immigration law and therefore they are not entitled to any payments. Secondly, if that status changes under Australian immigration law at any time in the future, consistent with Australian government practice in the past, they would be entitled to a range of supports, as the Howard government provided. But that is entirely determined on the basis of what happens with the future determination of their status.Thirdly, in respect of any support which is given to them in terms of sustenance by organisations like the UNHCR or IOM and international governments around the world who support those organisations, of course those arrangements would proceed as normal, as they have in all other circumstances. That is the second question, which the honourable member suggests that I have not answered directly. - Mr Speaker, I dealt with three elements of it. He says that it was not answered directly. Point (1) was payments now, (2) was payments by international agencies and support for those agencies by way of sustenance payments for individuals concerned, and (3) -  -  - Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is always in search of how you whip it up into a censure motion. The agenda of course is to save his leadership - and it is Thursday, and it is not about the policy in question. Let me go to the third one which he asked, which was about the Oceanic Viking's diplomatic clearance being extended. My advice is that the normal extension of diplomatic clearances for vessels is a routine matter between governments and, given what the Indonesian foreign minister said last night, we have no advice before the government which suggests any difficulty with the continued extension of the diplomatic clearance which extends to the vessel at present. That is the third one that he raised. And what was the first one, which is now the fourth? - It is the national security adviser - I just wanted a prompt. - If the honourable Leader of the Opposition has made a full and complete study, as I am sure he and everyone has, of my first national security statement to the Australian parliament, he will recall from that, given that it was such a scintillating document, that the national security adviser answers to yours truly. That is why he is in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Duncan Lewis also provided advice on security matters to my predecessor, Mr Howard, when he was Prime Minister. He is a professional public servant who has had extensive service in the Australian military. He therefore provides advice to the Prime Minister of the day. In this case it is this Prime Minister. And on the questions which concern -  - Mr Speaker, I would have assumed that the honourable Leader of the Opposition would conclude from the administrative orders the fact that I am the Prime Minister and I have a thing called the Prime Minister's department. There is a bloke in it called the national security adviser and I have declared publicly that he answers to me and he probably does on this as well. So there you go: (1),(2), (3), (4) - answered.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. I know that he is a great supporter of his local schools and the teachers in his schools. A little earlier today I was in the Great Hall, where it was my very great pleasure to award to principals, teachers and support staff the Australian Awards for Teaching Excellence. It was a great occasion, where we celebrated the achievements of some outstanding Australians who have dedicated their lives to education. Tomorrow is World Teachers Day, the celebration of World Teachers Day in Australia. On this side of the House - and I am sure that I speak for the Independents as well - we are great supporters of teachers. -  - I understand that opposition members may be interjecting about that and do not quite share that support for Australian teachers. But we are great supporters of teachers and we are supporting the celebration of World Teachers Day in Australia.We are also investing in improving the quality of teaching in Australian schools. We know that there is nothing more important to a child's education than the quality of the interaction between that child and their teacher. That is why we are investing $550 million in improving teacher quality and school leadership. This money is being invested in ventures like Teach for Australia, to bring the highest performing graduates into teaching. This summer the first cohort of Teach for Australia will be in training and next school year they will be in disadvantaged schools that need teachers with enthusiasm, high-performing graduates there working with those kids.Our quality teaching initiatives also extend to paying the best teachers more to go to the classrooms that need them the most. This is being started in New South Wales, where highly accomplished teachers will be paid $100,000 to teach in disadvantaged schools, bringing their skills to the parts of the country where they can make the most difference. This is to be celebrated. It is a celebration of teaching, but of course we celebrate great teaching because we know what a difference it can make for the education of Australian students.When it comes to our education revolution there is a linked set of reform measures to make a difference for every child in every school. These are a set of reform measures to lift standards right around the country and to end the spectre we currently have in this country, and have had for far too long, of kids from poorer households not getting the great education that they deserve. We will continue to deliver our measures for an education revolution and, of course, tomorrow we will be celebrating teachers and teaching in this country as part of World Teaching Day.</DOC>

 - The honourable Leader of the Opposition's question goes to this: is the government considering - or has it decided on - the provision of payments to individuals on this particular vessel 'for the sole purpose of leaving the boat'? My advice is that is not the case. I also add to and reinforce what I said to you before, which is that international agencies - the IOM and the UNHCR - routinely provide sustenance payments to individuals in circumstances like this and they are in turn supported by governments around the world. That is the answer to the honourable gentleman's question.But what is quite plain from all of this is that the Leader of the Opposition is again trying to find some ground, a bit of atmosphere, to whip up the old censure motion, because it sort of started to rock a bit last time around. The bottom line is this: if you are going to get onto the business of a censure motion - I assume it is coming, or maybe it is not, as it is Thursday - then it is probably useful to have an alternative policy. Because when you censure a government for doing something you have to be saying what the government should be doing instead. That is it, I think, and I really have not seen much of that so far. But we know, however, from the Ronaldson tactics handbook that it is not about policy; it is all about stereotyping and it is all about those in the tactics room - all 40 of them squeezed in the room, half of the entire parliamentary party and Rabbit's friends and relations - dreaming up the censure motion, working on the key lines and themes, working on who we can stereotype next time, but not one single word of policy. Our position is clear.I also draw attention to a media release from the Australian Federal Police dated 29 October stating:Four Indonesian men who allegedly facilitated a people smuggling venture to Australia in September 2009 were charged yesterday by the Australian Federal Police _ with people smuggling offences.The four men will appear in Perth Magistrates Court today.I draw that to the attention of the House.</DOC>

 - Together with the Minister for Industry, Innovation, Science and Research and various other members from this side of the House - and I hope there were some from the other side of the House - I attended last night in the Great Hall the annual awards for the Prime Minister's Prize for Science. This is a great gathering of the Australian scientific community because you bring together not just scientists at the pointy end - that is, those out there in laboratory land doing all those interesting things in white coats, which most of us in this room have no idea about -  - The Minister for Education says, 'Speak for yourself!' What was also really impressive about the gathering was the concentration of teachers of science - that is, primary school and secondary school teachers - who were properly recognised and rewarded for their achievements. We had a primary school teacher there who was legitimately proud of what he had done with kids a couple of hours north of Perth. He was working with those kids to get their minds fired and inspired with the wonders of science. Similarly, a secondary school teacher also received an award because of the work he has done in a secondary school re-entry facility in Adelaide. He told me that there were four such facilities in Adelaide. For people who have not made it through to year 12 and go off and do a few other things in life and come back, he is instilling a real passion for science in those folk who come back to do their year 12 equivalent.This was a great gathering and it was a great opportunity last night to see people appropriately recognised for their scientific achievements. The winner of this year's Prime Minister's Prize for Science was Dr John O'Sullivan of the CSIRO for his contributions to astronomy and to the invention that made wireless computing a part of our everyday lives. What a great scientific innovation from Australia. This is a great piece of good news for the country. Dr O'Sullivan was not looking for a major breakthrough in information communications technology at the time. In fact, he was looking for something called 'black holes'. He was out there in astronomy land. 
A government member - That's where they are on the other side. - Yes, he found Liberal policy on the way! In the process of working in laboratories, he developed a real passion for how he could deal with the whole problem of wireless computing. He worked with colleagues around the world to bring this invention to fruition. Their invention is now enshrined in international standards and built into computers, printers, smartphones and other devices used by hundreds of millions of people every day. It is a great example of how basic blue-sky research can lead to very practical benefits. The Science Minister's Prize for Life Scientist of the Year went to Professor Michael Cowley from Monash University's Faculty of Medicine for the advances he has made in understanding and treating human obesity and the ailments that go with it, including diabetes and heart disease.The Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year went to Dr Amanda Barnard, from the CSIRO, for her achievements in modelling nanoparticles. This is a key to unlocking the benefits of nanotechnology, which promises us everything from better medicines to more efficient solar panels. And last night I was introduced to a new term called 'nanodiamonds'. I do not know what a nanodiamond is, but it is good and it is being worked on at the moment by our great legion of nanotechnologists and nanoscientists! - The Leader of the Opposition knows what a nanodiamond is, he tells me. The Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Primary Schools has gone to Mr Alan Whittome, from the Badgingarra Primary School in Western Australia. I ask my WA colleagues: have I got the pronunciation right? - Got it. His secret is to show his students that science is a part of life and not just something to be done at school. The Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Secondary Schools has been awarded to Mr Len Altman, from Marden Senior College in Adelaide. Mr Altman, as I said before, is leading a renaissance in geoscience teaching in South Australia. These are great achievements.A few weeks ago there was another significant development for Australian science: Australian born and educated biologist Professor Elizabeth Blackburn was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine. What a great achievement for Australian science. What a great achievement for an Australian woman scientist. This is a fantastic achievement for the country. She is Australia's first female Nobel laureate - period. Professor Blackburn stands in great Australian company alongside the likes of Sir Howard Florey and Professor Peter Doherty. The prize was awarded for her work on chromosomes. I called Professor Blackburn personally to congratulate her on her outstanding achievement. I am sure that everyone in this House will join me in acknowledging Professor Elizabeth Blackburn for receiving the Nobel Prize for Medicine. It is an achievement of which Australians can be proud.This government is proud of Australia's science community. We are proud of our science teachers in primary schools, in secondary schools; we are proud of our science lecturers through the universities; we are proud of what those in the laboratories are doing now. This country punches above its weight when it comes to the scientific community, writ across all the disciplines. This is why the education minister and the industry minister are so actively supporting research, innovation and science at the schools level, at the university level and at the research institute level across the country. This is good for the country's future. If we are going to build long-term productivity growth, part of that productivity growth lies in building a culture of innovation and of invention, of which science must be the core. I commend the winners of these awards.</DOC>

 - First of all, I have had a few things on today and I have not seen his remarks, but he is -  -  - No, I am just saying that I have not. But, secondly, if they are correctly paraphrased -  -  - I am just saying I have not seen his remarks. I am being completely straight with you. I have not seen what he said. It does not surprise me what the given individual might be saying in any public policy debate on any given day. He has a habit of expressing his views in his own way.My own view is that in Australia there is a strong, fundamental tradition of racial tolerance and inclusion, of which all Australians are proud. It is not my view that there is a racist sentiment in the Australian society. It is my view that this country is built on a culture of tolerance - one which embraces our neighbours; one which seeks to include people from different ethnic origins; one which seeks to embrace properly, through our orderly refugee program. It is a culture in which we can say to those who come here from offshore: your future in this country can be part of the nation-building program of Australia's 21st century. Ours is a nation which brings all peoples from the world together in one and forges our one Australia. That is the one that I believe in.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question and indeed for his role in facilitating the participation of members of parliament in this critical debate that is before the House - for a second time. Indeed, this side of the House has gone out of its way to consult and put in place mechanisms that were asked for by the opposition to maximise the participation in the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We were in fact asked to give guarantees that people would not be gagged, that people would have the opportunity to represent the range of views that are across the other side on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Because of that, we put in place mechanisms of the House to facilitate those arrangements. Indeed, I was given leave by every member of the House to move a resolution that was adopted unanimously, by every member of the House, on Tuesday to allow for an extension of time for debate last night, when the parliament sat until 11 pm, and again this afternoon, beyond the normal adjournment time of 4.30. Indeed, as late as this morning the opposition was adding names to the list to speak on these bills, names such as the member for Sturt, the member for Berowra, the member for McPherson - they do not want to hear from you, Member for McPherson!They then came in here, having agreed to arrangements, having asked for extra time to have the debate, and moved a guillotine - on their own speakers! The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday in the House:_ last week, we proposed a set of common-sense amendments to the scheme and we are currently engaged in good faith negotiation with the government on them.There has not been much good faith in the procedures occurring in this House. A request was made by the opposition. It was agreed to by the government. Procedures were put in place to ensure that agreement could be delivered. But it is not about good faith; it is about the division in the Liberal Party. They will do anything to avoid the final decision on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. What the opposition have to do is guarantee that they will not filibuster in the Senate to avoid a decision being taken on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is up to the Leader of the Opposition to pull his ramshackle of a party together and ensure that they genuinely support these good faith negotiations. We have already seen the Nationals say that they will vote against the CPRS.The member for New England has amendments to the CPRS legislation that he is entitled to move and to have considered by the House. Similarly, the member for Dawson, the member for Page, the member for Chifley and the member for Shortland are entitled to make their contribution before this House. If the opposition are truly ready and keen to vote on this issue, they should give a commitment to vote on this legislation this year. Their stunt today was consistent with their strategy, which was outlined by the Manager of Opposition Business on Channel 9 and which is that they will consider their options. We know that in their tactics room they have considered moving a motion in the Senate to not have this legislation considered this year. We know that is on their agenda and their stunt today shows their absolute hypocrisy on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The fact is that we are dealing with a very difficult issue. We are dealing with the Indonesia authorities to ensure the safe transfer of the passengers on the Oceanic Viking to Indonesian territory. That is what we are doing. In relation to that, we will continue to work with the Indonesia government pursuant to the agreement that was struck between the Prime Minister and the President some time ago. As we know and as the Indonesian foreign minister said last night, we are dealing with 78 human beings here. We will continue to ensure a humanitarian response to this issue.I can confirm that the Prime Minister was correct in informing the House that this matter has not been canvassed by the government. The matter that was referred to in the question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not referred to by the government. I can say to the House that we will work patiently and calmly with the Indonesian authorities pursuant to the agreement that has been reached. While I am on my feet, I thank - and I am sure that all members of the House would like to do so - the crew on the Oceanic Viking for their good work. This is a very difficult situation that they are confronted with. The care that they are discharging and the concern that they are exhibiting for these passengers should be commended by this House. We will continue to work with the Indonesian authorities and resolve this matter to the satisfaction of the agreement reached between the two countries.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton, a good friend colleague and neighbour - he is the member for an electorate neighbouring mine. I know that, through all his work before he was elected and, since that, he was dedicated to supporting the small business community of the south side of Brisbane. This is the 27th question that I have received from the government side of the chamber on small business matters. I want to thank each and every member of the Rudd Labor government for their interest and support in small business. It is my melancholy duty to advise the House that it is now 517 days since I last got a question from the shadow small business minister, which is two days longer than the siege of Leningrad.In the May budget, the Rudd government allocated $10 million to help small businesses go online to take full advantage of the opportunities that will be offered by the National Broadband Network. I thank the Prime Minister for his support for that initiative. Indeed, there has been very strong interest in the delivery of this program, with more than 300 applications having been received for that funding program. We expect to announce the successful applicants by the end of next month. I am asked also about existing online information for small businesses. I can advise the House that the government website business.gov.au is proving both popular and very effective. A recent survey of users found that last month there were 472,000 visits to that website and that it helped achieve median savings to businesses of $325. So that is good news.business.gov.au, however, is not the only website providing information to small business. In fact, the shadow small business minister operates his own website and it provides criticism of the government's small business policies. We expect that from the coalition - just criticism, no constructive comment. But on a related website the shadow small business minister urges local residents 'to get behind my alcohol-free October to help raise money and educate children about the dangers of drugs and alcohol'. That is good. On 27 September the Gold Coast Bulletin reported on this good initiative, and said that the shadow minister, in promoting an alcohol-free month of October - called 'Ocsober' - had 'signed up to stay sober for the entire month'. That is good. But today the Gold Coast Bulletin has run a story headed, 'Ciobo busted drinking in Ocsober'. That is bad. - He did want to go but he has the MPI. In excusing his transgressions the shadow minister explained that he bought leave passes that allowed him to have a drink. When asked how many leave passes he had bought for the month of Ocsober, he answered, 'Four.' Four leave passes! The paper quotes him explaining today:'If I had not been able to purchase leave passes, I probably would not have participated.'It was a crucial part of the deal.'So the deal was, 'I'll pretend I'm sober but I'll get drunk on four occasions, or at least have a few drinks.' - Thank you for that advice. I accept your advice as always, Mr Speaker. I am in the home stretch now. It seems that during Ocsober the shadow minister has been off the wagon almost as much as he has been on it, but the good news -  - Indeed I am. The good news for the shadow minister is that there is only two days left in Ocsober, which means he can have a drink and - </DOC>

 - I thank Leader of the Opposition for his question. Today we saw, I believe, the national institutions working at their best through the assembly of members both from the government and opposition in the Great Hall as we sought to right a great wrong, which is the extraordinary mistreatment extended to the forgotten Australians and Australian child migrants over the better part of a century. We the government and the Leader of the Opposition representing the opposition extended on a bipartisan basis an unqualified national apology to those Australians who had experienced this abuse and neglect.We forget the numbers of those involved here and sometimes we are desensitised to this. But let us all remember that we are talking about half a million Australians during the course of last century who were placed in institutional or foster care in this country. This is a very large number of Australians. Regrettably, through the Senate inquiry reports - three of which have been done, two under the previous government and one under our own - we see example after example after example of physical abuse, of emotional abuse, of sexual abuse and the consequent damage to such a large number of our fellow Australians over such a long period of time. This morning it was important to reflect to the gathered representatives of these forgotten Australians and these former child migrants that the House and the parliament is at one in extending this national apology to them. Some have asked, 'Why is this necessary? What is the point? These are things which happened a long time ago.' For those who have received such mistreatment over time, the actual extension of the simple words 'we are sorry' of itself contains within it a healing balm to exceptionally raw wounds - raw wounds which have been left to fester for so many decades.We also spoke about the impact on child migrant Australians. Here we have a group of some 7,000 who came from the United Kingdom and Malta and who were settled here from the 1920s on as part of a resettlement program by the UK in particular to various countries across the world including Australia. But the problem was this: children were often taken without their consent or in the absence of the full knowledge of what was happening, and often without the consent of their parents as well. For those child migrant Australians this has been an extraordinarily brutal experience: ripped away from one part of the world and taken to another, ripped away from childhood family and friends, and often losing forever connections with the family which gave birth to them.The government of the United Kingdom has indicated that it too will now extend an apology to those thousands of children from Britain who were sent around the world. I understand Prime Minister Brown, in a letter to the relevant House of Commons committee which outlined the intention of his government this morning to apologise, has recognised the importance of giving voice to the traumatic experiences of many former child migrants:It is important that we take the time to listen to the voices of the survivors and the victims of these misguided policies.The chair of the House of Commons select committee noted the importance of the Australian apology in the decision of Prime Minister Brown to apologise himself on behalf of the government of the United Kingdom. To quote the chairman of the Commons committee:The reason why this is happening now is that Australia itself has decided to recognise _ what it did to some of its Indigenous population and to child migrants.                    _                   _                   _There is now a Government in Australia that's prepared to go the extra mile as it were to apologise for what happened to its own children and to ours when they got there.If our apology today in our parliamentary building has in some way influenced the decision by the British government to apologise, it is a good thing. As the Leader of the Opposition and I found today from speaking personally with so many of these victims of abuse, the extension of simple words of sorrow, remorse and apology on behalf of governments, who are responsible ultimately for the laws of this nation and for the institutions which provide care, so-called, is so important.In addition to the extension of apology in both these respects, what I also outlined today on behalf of the government was some practical measures for the future. One was to say this: the stories told by this group of Australians should be recorded for the future. As I noted this morning in my remarks - and we are familiar with this quote from the historical sages of times past - any nation which forgets its history is condemned to relive it. Therefore, the extraordinary record contained already in the Senate reports is good, but what we have extended today through specific programs on behalf of both the National Library and the National Museum is an opportunity for those forgotten Australians and former child migrants to place their oral history or written history on the record and to have it there for the future so that we might reflect in generations to come on what went radically wrong in this country over the last 100 years. On top of that, I also indicated to those assembled today - and, I note, with support from the opposition - that we intend to provide a special category or recognition of assistance within the aged-care framework of the nation to deal with those who have come from this institutional background. This has been a particular request on behalf of so many of the peak bodies who have represented this group of abused Australians.What we hear so often from groups across Australia is: 'How do we find contact with those from whom we have been disconnected?' So many times we hear the stories of those who have spent decades trying to track down a mother, a father, a brother or a sister. Decades later, they find that person, only to discover that they have just died. So what we are seeking to do is to establish a national find and connect service aimed at supporting the activities of the wounded Australians in these fields to make contact with their loved ones. This will not always be possible, but we can provide some practical means of assistance.Finally - and the Leader of the Opposition was kind in his remarks on this today - we show bipartisan support for the advocacy groups which have stood up for so long in support of the interests of these abused Australians. These are groups like CLAN, the Alliance for Forgotten Australians and the Child Migrants Trust. What I indicated today on behalf of the government - and, again, with the support of the opposition - is that we will continue to provide funding support for these organisations in the future as they continue to advocate for the interests of their number.I conclude where I began. This has been a good day for our parliamentary institution. We recognise on both sides of the House the extraordinary burden placed on anyone in public office to do whatever is physically possible to provide for the protection of children. We have seen, from governments of all political persuasions and all levels in the past, that task not having been properly performed. So this has been one exercise in bringing about some healing for these Australians. As I said this morning, the Senate, in their report, described these half a million Australians as the forgotten Australians. Let us henceforth instead regard these Australians, these precious Australians, as the remembered Australians.</DOC>

 - I will happily table, for the information of the House, as I understand it is already in circulation, the text of a note signed by the relevant official from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Jim O'Callaghan, minister-counsellor for immigration at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia. It is not a remarkable document, and I will table it for the Leader of the Opposition's information.The second thing I will comment on in response to the honourable member's question is his reference to preferential treatment. I say to the honourable gentleman the following: he should take note of a letter, which I will also table, from the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. It reads as follows:I would like to confirm the following matters regarding the procedural and other arrangements applying to the group - referring to the group of individuals on this vessel. The letter says, among other things:The group is being treated in a manner consistent with that afforded to any other asylum seeker or refugee in Indonesia. Secondly, they have been, are being or will be, assessed by the UNHCR in accordance with the usual processes. Thirdly, the Indonesian government and the Australian government have agreed to a set of arrangements regarding the time frames for the processing of the group in Indonesia, consistent with international practice and settlement procedures.That, among other things contained in the letter, which I am about to table, clearly articulates from the perspective of the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship that these are not preferential arrangements; they are consistent with normal process. I commend this letter to the honourable gentleman for his information. As soon as I have a copy of the other document that I referred to before, in answer to his question I will table it presently.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I want to take this opportunity to say a few thankyous to all the people who have made today's very, very moving occasion possible. First and foremost, I thank all those members of the forgotten Australians. As the Prime Minister has said to everyone today, we need to now start to describe the people who were part of this generation as the remembered Australians. But I want to thank all of those people: the former child migrants, their families, all of the people who came to support them here in Canberra and all of the people who participated right around Australia. We had events in each of the capital cities and many of our regional towns. To each and every one of you, for being prepared to participate in what was, and I think will continue to be for some time, a very emotional day, we thank you very, very deeply.To the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, I say thank you. If everyone else does not mind, I will say on behalf of the whole parliament: thank you to both of you for the way in which you contributed today. You have made it the special day that half a million Australians had been hoping for. We all thank you very much for that.None of this would have been possible without a lot of guidance. I asked Andrew Murray a few months ago if he would head an advisory committee to the government to help us make sure that we had a very serious occasion that recognised the importance of what we did today. He was joined by a number of people: Ian Thwaites from the Child Migrants Trust, Harold Haig from the International Association of Former Child Migrants and Their Families, Caroline Carroll from the Alliance of Forgotten Australians, and Leonie Sheedy and Joanna Penglase from the Care Leavers Australia Network. These are people with enormous hearts who are from what can only be described as advocacy groups, people who have done so much over such a long time, listening to and caring for people who are in many, many cases extremely damaged from their terrible lives in institutions, orphanages and foster care.Andrew did a wonderful job as a senator heading various inquiries into these issues, along with all the senators who helped him on those inquiries, and we do thank him and them. As for the advocacy groups, we would not have got it right without them. We would not have been able to express ourselves in the way that we all have today without their guidance, and I sincerely thank them all.I do particularly want to thank the members for Corio and Blaxland - who have in some ways been first-class pests! - for making sure that today happened. If you want something done and you want something done passionately, those two know how to make sure it happens. You have been wonderful advocates for and wonderful friends to the forgotten Australians and the former child migrants.I also want to single out the member for Swan, who I think might have gone to join the people out the front. He spoke very movingly here just half an hour or so ago, partly about his own personal experience - and it was wonderful to know that his brother was able to be here with him today. He has a very deep understanding of many of these people, whose suffering he shared. I am sure he is representing us all very well out on the lawns in front of Parliament House now, as people listen to music, share stories and, we hope, together begin the healing process.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first thing I would say about the document he refers to, which is signed by the Minister-Counsellor for Immigration, the Australian Embassy, Jakarta, is that my advice - though I have been out of the country for some days - is that it has been in the public domain for some time. The question refers to paragraph 1 in the document, which is one of three conditionalities: the first is if the UNHCR has found an individual to be a refugee, the second is if they have already registered with UNHCR but their status has not been determined and the third is if they have not yet registered with UNHCR and their status is yet to be determined. It prescribes a general overall approach of different time frames between the first and the second and third categories, one of four to six weeks and the other of around 12 weeks.The honourable gentleman then referred in his question to the letter from the secretary of the department of immigration to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship today. Again, the introduction to that is:I would like to confirm the following matters regarding the procedure and other arrangements applying to the group.The secretary of the department goes on to say:The group is being treated in a manner consistent with that afforded to any other asylum seeker or refugee in Indonesia.The further dot point which is in the letter which I referred to before says, and it goes specifically to the question of time frames - that is what the honourable member has asked about:The Indonesian government and the Australian government have agreed to a set of arrangements regarding the time frames for the processing of the group in Indonesia, consistent with international practice and resettlement procedures.In other words, there is nothing remarkable about the time frames. Therefore, we can act on the basis of the advice of the secretary of the department. He has provided us with that advice, and therefore the government, in seeking to resolve this complex matter and other complex immigration matters, will do so according to normal procedures, as confirmed by the secretary's advice contained in this letter today.</DOC>

 - I thank the excellent member for Leichhardt for his question. Not only has he been active in making representations on the part of his constituency, but can I say in the various visits I have made as Prime Minister to Cairns and been with him and received the representations from his community that he is held in the highest regard by his community as well. The honourable member asked me about a question which goes to the heart of the interests of the people of Far North Queensland. It is climate change and its impact on the Barrier Reef as well. If you are concerned about climate change it would follow that you are concerned about the Barrier Reef -  - Right on cue, the member for Boothby intervenes - and jobs. Let me think: how many people are employed in tourism on the Great Barrier Reef? Tens of thousands. What happens if you do not have a Barrier Reef? You do not have tens of thousands of jobs in tourism, which is why people in Far North Queensland are so desperately concerned about the impact on coral bleaching and other factors coming off climate change on what is not just an enormous environmental asset for Australia and the world but also, critically, a generator of jobs in Far North Queensland.The honourable member asked me specifically about national and global action on climate change. I have just returned this morning from the APEC meeting in Singapore. In Singapore it was my privilege together with the President of Mexico to co-host a meeting of leaders from the APEC economies with the Prime Minister of Denmark. The Prime Minister of Denmark is the President of the Conference of Parties which will be convened in Copenhagen in about three weeks time. The clock is ticking as far as climate change is concerned, but the clock is also ticking when it comes to concluding an agreement at Copenhagen, and that is what we were talking about. Some weeks ago, as I have indicated in various public interviews and possibly in the parliament itself, the Prime Minister of Denmark asked the Mexican President and me to become Friends of the Chair -  -  - to assist in what we can possibly do to bring about an agreement in Copenhagen. And it is good to see there is such a strong level of interest on the part of those opposite in sealing a deal! I understand the National Party may have reflected their view on these matters. I thought the Liberal Party was still supposed to be seriously engaged in these negotiations on climate change. Perhaps the script has already been lost on the part of those opposite. This meeting, which is so derided, it seems, by some of those opposite, was attended by the President of the United States, the President of China, the Prime Minister of Japan, the President of Indonesia, the President of Korea and others. The object was this: how do we use a leaders-level process -  -  - How do we bring about a leaders-level process to try and obtain an agreement at Copenhagen, given the fact that the officials-level progress so far has become bogged down? What we were able to do then, in consultation with one another, was to listen carefully to the briefing by the Danish Prime Minister, Prime Minister Rasmussen, on how we could bring about a framework agreement for Copenhagen, a strong global agreement in which the world agrees to the global goal of keeping global temperature rises within two degrees and where individual nations commit to specific actions to reduce emissions; one in which a global agreement is built on the basis of individual national actions, which becomes entirely relevant to the debate we have in this parliament on what happens with the future of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.Sunday's meeting of 19 leaders, co-chaired between the Mexicans and us and with the Prime Minister of Denmark in attendance, was an important step forward in seeking to bring about such a framework agreement. This will be difficult. It is also part of the challenge which the President of the United States now takes to Beijing for his bilateral visit to the People's Republic of China, where the climate change discussions there are of such fundamental relevance to what now transpires in the lead-up to Copenhagen.There were two clear and important outcomes from yesterday's meeting in Singapore. One is that many leaders have for the first time indicated that they will be attending the Copenhagen meeting. - The Prime Minister of Japan, which apparently obtains the scoffing interjection of the member for O'Connor, confirmed that he would be attending. In addition to the Prime Minister of Japan, the President of Korea, the President of Indonesia - himself so much the author of the Bali roadmap - together with the Chileans, together with us, together with others. The second important outcome was that there was a broad agreement among leaders to support a framework political agreement. President Obama spoke in support of such a proposal. In fact, he cautioned the group not to let the 'perfect' become the enemy of the 'good' in the agreement that we can seek to realise in Copenhagen. Prime Minister Rasmussen made an important contribution to this meeting. But the underlying logic is clear: a global deal is the sum of the national contributions which underpin it, including the Australian national contribution. - Again the member for O'Connor scoffs. I thought the Liberal Party were engaged in serious negotiations with us. Without clear national positions, including strong national commitments, there can be no deal, which is why we must work on our national commitments as well, which brings us to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. In an exercise of good faith on the part of the government, what we have indicated to the opposition in their good faith negotiations with us is that we are prepared to act on their concerns relating to agriculture. In the positions which have been put forward by the coalition to us up until now, the advice that we have obtained from the coalition is that agriculture was, frankly, a red line issue for them. Therefore, because we are determined to try and bring about a deal on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and because we recognise some of the internal political realities within the coalition, we have made this as a good faith gesture on our part in our determined efforts to bring about an outcome.The final two weeks of sittings in the Senate will be devoted to the legislation. The legislation will be voted on in the House of Representatives and introduced to the Senate at the beginning of this week. There will be time for every single senator to speak on this bill - every single senator - if they so choose: two weeks. Further, the government will be prepared to extend parliamentary sittings as I know so many senators will want to speak on this bill. But the key thing is this: after so long of not acting on an emissions trading scheme within this country, the time has come to act, as those opposite have consistently argued themselves in recent years.I say to all those opposite: continue your good faith negotiations with the government. I urge your negotiator the member for Groom, my good friend from Queensland, not to lose heart but to remain engaged in these negotiations, because we have some global interests at stake which will ultimately so much hang, as far as Australia is concerned, on our national actions as well. There is also the minor matter of business certainty. We will continue these good faith negotiations with the coalition. In the national interest and for business certainty we want this outcome. For the international interest and to underpin a global framework agreement at Copenhagen we need this outcome. The clock is ticking for the planet, it is ticking for Australia and it is ticking for this parliament.</DOC>

 - I note the Leader of the Opposition continues to gainsay the advice provided to the government by the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. I referred before to what it said: that the Indonesian government and the Australian government have agreed to a set of arrangements regarding the timeframes for the processing of the group in Indonesia consistent with international practice and resettlement procedures.The special deal which the Leader of the Opposition seems to refer to would be a special deal sought by individuals on that vessel to bring the vessel to Australia and not have it processed in Indonesia. We took the view, given the circumstances surrounding this vessel and where it was located, that it is entirely appropriate, and the Indonesians agreed for this to occur, for the vessel to go to Indonesia. The special deal being sought by those on the vessel was for the vessel to come to Australia. We have not responded to that pressure. -  - Am I taking the interpretation from those opposite that they would wish to respond to that special pressure for a special deal and have the vessel come to Australia? They intervene that that is not their position. I seem to have heard the Liberal Premier of Western Australia say that that was precisely his position - that that vessel should come directly to Australia for processing. That is the position we have heard from them and I wait with interest for a position to be clearly articulated by the Leader of the Opposition: does he believe that this vessel should be processed in Indonesia or Australia? I have not heard him utter one clear statement on this, because yielding to special pressure, yielding to special deals, would be yielding to the demand that this vessel be processed in Australia rather than Indonesia. This government did not respond to that demand.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. Today the House will vote on one of the most important economic and environmental reforms that this country has ever undertaken, in the form of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. As the Prime Minister indicated earlier, the science on climate change is absolutely clear. It is real and the impacts will be significant, particularly in this country as a hot and dry continent. A failure to act will have adverse effects on our ecosystems and our economy.The recently released report, Climate Change Risks to Australia's Coasts, makes this need to act very clear indeed. The report predicted that up to 247,600 individual residential buildings worth $63 billion are at risk of inundation from a 1.1 metre sea level rise. That is modelled at the upper level of risk. Even with a midrange rise of 0.5 metres, current one-in-100-year extreme weather events, including inundation of coastal areas, could occur several times a year. It is very clear evidence of the importance of acting. At a 1.1 metre sea level rise major coastal infrastructure such as airports and ports will be at risk from inundation and more frequent extreme weather events. To mitigate this risk it is very important that we start reducing our emissions now. That is why the government is determined to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in this sitting period. The costs of further delay are unacceptable.The International Energy Agency predicts it will cost an additional $500 billion to cut global emissions for each year that global action is delayed. That is of course due to the increasing costs of adaptation that will occur and of the investment that will be needed in mitigation and abatement technology. The chairman of Shell Australia, Russell Caplan, recently made this observation about the issues concerning delay. He indicated that further delay:_  would create a climate of continuing uncertainty for industry and potentially delay the massive investments that are required _This is a problem that we are dealing with and that the business community is dealing with. This is why the government are working hard in good faith negotiations with the opposition to try and secure passage of this important legislation. It is also why the government announced yesterday that we will agree to exclude agricultural emissions from the CPRS indefinitely as part of a package agreed with the opposition. In addition, the government indicated that we would consider a range of ways in which the agriculture sector can reduce its emissions, including by being able to generate offsetting credits. These are very significant statements of policy; ones that the government have made in their determination to see a solution achieved. The National Farmers Federation is out today, along with other farming groups, supporting and welcoming these important moves.It is now time that we came together and passed this extremely important reform. It is time to get on with taking action on climate change. I call upon members of the opposition to take responsibility in this respect. Support emissions reductions in our economy. Support the government's efforts internationally. Rise above your internal squabbling, act in the interests of the Australian people and support the CPRS.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I note that the Leader of the Opposition routinely disputes the advice provided to us by the independent Public Service of Australia. It is part of a routine behaviour: attack the Secretary of the Treasury when you do not like what the Treasury advice is, and on this day, attack the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship because you happen to disagree with what his advice is. The Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has said very simply that the Indonesian government and the Australian government have agreed to a set of arrangements regarding the time frames for the processing of the group in Indonesia consistent with international practice of resettlement procedures. I would suggest that he pays attention to that advice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Australia is very lucky to have 17 World Heritage places like the Great Barrier Reef, magnificent natural and cultural assets, sites of global significance. The fact is we keep them in trust for the future whilst we benefit from them now in many ways. In particular, our 17 World Heritage places are places of significant economic value. They are economic assets that generate annually around $12 billion and support around 120,000 jobs. That is a lot of employment for this country.I am asked about threats to our World Heritage sites. In August I released a report that says that our iconic World Heritage properties face increased threats from climate change. This report, The implications of climate change for Australia's World Heritage properties, assesses the likely impacts of climate change on these places. Sites including the Sydney Opera House, the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu National Park, the Tasmanian Wilderness and the Greater Blue Mountains area are identified as particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Effects include reduced rainfall, higher sea and land surface temperatures, more severe storm events, ocean acidification and rising sea levels. The most concerning thing about this report is that many properties listed for their natural values, amongst them the Great Barrier Reef, the Gondwana Rainforests, Fraser Island and Shark Bay, have a low capacity to adapt to climate change impacts. They are going to be difficult to protect from those effects of climate change.I am asked what the government is doing to address these threats. The answer, Mr Speaker, is plenty, including building up the resilience and capacity of these places to adapt to the dangers that climate change presents. We are preparing the first ever climate change adaptation plan for Australia's World Heritage and iconic areas. We are also providing significant funding to better manage individual World Heritage areas of which the $200 million Reef Rescue program under Caring for our Country is one example.Today I have announced that the Rudd government will invest an additional $38 million in the conservation and preservation of Australia's World Heritage places through the Caring for our Country program. The Caring for our Country World Heritage funding will address a range of environmental challenges, from eradicating pests on Macquarie Island in the Southern Ocean to protecting the biodiversity of Shark Bay in Western Australia. In the Gondwana Rainforests, stretching up the north-east coast of New South Wales into the south-east of Queensland, we will provide almost $3.2 million over four years to help protect these ancient forests that house more than 200 rare and threatened plant and animal species. In western New South Wales private landholders in the Wallangra Lakes region will be assisted to combat erosion and pest plants and animals, helping ensure that the World Heritage values of this ancient region, which has been home to Aboriginal people for more than 50,000 years, remain intact.The government is profoundly committed to safeguarding these special places. We can do that directly through good management, adequate funding and a heightened awareness of the need to act. But we must also act by introducing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme so that Australia can play its part in addressing dangerous climate change here at home and globally. With support from those opposite, we can bring through this important measure. It is in the national interest, it is in the international interest, and, critically, we can give upcoming generations the best chance of experiencing some of our most cherished places, our World Heritage areas.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Last week on Monday I visited Sri Lanka, Colombo, together with the government's special representative to Sri Lanka, John McCarthy, the Ambassador for People Smuggling, Peter Woolcott, and also the acting Director-General of AusAID, Peter Baxter. There I met with President Rajapaksa, my counterpart Foreign Minister Bogollagama and also the Sri Lankan Minister for Law and Justice and the Minister for Human Rights and Disaster Management. As members of the House would appreciate, Sri Lanka has been through a terrible conflict, a civil war lasting over 25 years where thousands of people were casualties and thousands of people were displaced. We have only recently seen the end of that conflict. The challenge for Sri Lanka, with the assistance of the international community, is now to win the peace.There were three areas of discussion that I had with the president and his ministers: firstly, cooperation on people-smuggling; secondly, how Australia could assist on the resettlement of displaced people and also reconstruction of considerably damaged territory, particularly in the north and in the east; and, finally, a reconciliation or a healing process so that all people in Sri Lanka would feel as though they had a role in Sri Lanka's future. So far as people-smuggling cooperation is concerned, Australia already cooperates well with Sri Lanka on people-smuggling matters but a memorandum of understanding was signed between Australia and Sri Lanka, by the special representative on Australia's side and a senior Sri Lankan official on Sri Lanka's side, to enhance our cooperation, particularly in legal areas, particularly with building capacity so far as prosecutions and disruptions are concerned.Secondly, we also agreed that it was important, given that we are dealing with very difficult and complex issues so far as source and transit and destination countries are concerned, that both Australia and Sri Lanka continue to work very hard within the Bali process, the regional institution for dealing with people-smuggling and human-trafficking matters. In Australia in the middle of December, officials, under the guise of the Bali process, will consider some of the difficult people-smuggling matters associated with Sri Lanka. Dealing with that matter, there was a memorandum of understanding, as I have said, but Foreign Minister Bogollagama and I released a joint statement which dealt not just with those matters but also with questions of resettlement and also questions of reconciliation.So far as displaced people are concerned, members would be aware that thousands of people were displaced and earlier in the year we had anywhere up to a quarter of a million Sri Lankans in displaced people's camps. Initially Australia, together with the international community, was very, very concerned about lack of international agency access to those camps. Over time that access has improved. Indeed, special representative McCarthy last week visited one of the displaced people's camps. We have welcomed very much the fact that in recent weeks, in the last month or so, a substantial number of people have been resettled from those camps, but there is still a substantial job to be done. In the past Australia has rendered assistance to this. Some $35 million worth of humanitarian and development assistance has been given by Australia to Sri Lanka over the last two years or so and in very recent times $10 million to improve conditions in the camps but, more importantly, to resettle. I announced when I was there a further contribution by Australia of $11 million: $6 million to assist in de-mining to ensure that the areas where people are resettled to are free from the terrible blight of landmines; also $3 million to help through the United Nations with housing to resettle these people from displaced camps into accommodation; and, thirdly, $2 million worth of food through the World Food Program.I very much made the point to the President and his ministers that, in ensuring this resettlement occurs, freedom of movement so far as those displaced people are concerned is absolutely essential. I also made the point that Australia was looking favourably to assisting both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank on its reconstruction projects in the north and in the east, and in Singapore in the margins of APEC I had a conversation with Mr Zoellick, the executive director of the World Bank, indicating Australia's in-principle support for those reconstruction efforts so far as the World Bank is concerned.Finally, it is absolutely essential - and here Sri Lanka needs both the urgings and the assistance of Australia and the international community - that, having won the war, the Sri Lankan government now needs to win the peace. That can only be done through a process of reconciliation, through a process of political rapprochement, through a process of healing. It is very important that the Sri Lankan government continues to move on this front, continues to look seriously at questions of devolution, continues to ensure that all Sri Lankans have a view that they have a share in the country's future. I made the point that Australia has made publicly in the past, that at the end of the conflict there are very many allegations of atrocities and breaches of human rights. We expect that these atrocities will be independently and credibly investigated. We welcome the fact that Sri Lanka has responded to the report of the United States Department of State by establishing a commission of inquiry. We will watch that very closely and we hope that that will be a credible and independent investigation of these allegations made on both sides of the conflict.Lastly, the special representative, Mr McCarthy, will submit a full report to me of his visit. We are proposing to share this report with our friends and partners in the region, with our like-minded friends. It is very important that Australia not only holds Sri Lanka to account on these key issues but renders as much assistance as we can to help Sri Lanka win the peace.</DOC>

 - My dealings with President Yudhoyono of Indonesia are in first-class working order right across the spread of the bilateral relationship, including on border security matters - and I will come back to the question of our meetings at the recent APEC gathering. Can I say to the member for Curtin that, notwithstanding the opposition's preoccupation with this individual vessel - which some would say is a legitimate preoccupation - we are, with the Indonesians, on a rolling basis engaged in a series of interruptions of people-smuggling activities. In fact, together with other countries in the region, in the last 12 months we have engaged in some 90 interruptions of such activities.In the course of the APEC meeting the President of Indonesia and I discussed a range of things, including his visit to Australia which will occur at either the end of this year or early next year - we are working on dates, and it is currently likely to be in February. Can I suggest to those opposite that as a further mark of respect for the Indonesian President - and I have had some early consultations with the Presiding Officers about this - and given that he was recently elected as the democratically elected President of his country, when he visits it would be good if he were extended the honour of addressing the Australian parliament. We think that is entirely appropriate, as it would be the first time he has done so.On the question of the APEC meetings and the discussions with the President of Indonesia -  - At the APEC meeting, I was aware of the fact that I would be seeing the President of Indonesia informally on a number of occasions. In total, there were about five occasions. We discussed everything from border protection to asylum seekers, the individual vessel in question, the President's visit to Australia, his possible address to the parliament as well as world peace. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question about the latest forecast for the economy, because I think there is something very special that we have seen in our recent forecasts. The impact of the economic stimulus, combined with all Australians, both employers and employees, working together, and a better global outlook, has meant that we are the fastest growing advanced economy. That is something we should all be proud of, because it has been the efforts of all Australians, working together, that have delivered that outcome. It is an outcome that has meant unemployment has been lower than it otherwise would be. It is an outcome that has meant we have had fewer business bankruptcies than we otherwise would have had. What that has meant is that there has been less skill destruction in the Australian economy, fewer long-term unemployed and less of a legacy of destruction for communities. And many more businesses have kept their doors open as a result of our economic stimulus. All of these outcomes were particularly underlined for me during my meetings at the G20 in Scotland and also at APEC in Singapore last week. What they show is the effectiveness of the economic stimulus and, as I said before, improved prospects in the global economy.That has also meant we have performed better than expected. Only a week or two ago I released our Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which forecast stronger growth, lower unemployment, lower deficits and lower debt compared to the budget. Our growth will continue to be stronger than any other advanced economy, growing by 1½ per cent in 2009-10, when every other advanced economy will this year contract. Unemployment in Australia is now expected to be 6¾ per cent by June 2010. That is much lower than the peak of 8½ per cent forecast in the budget and well below the double digit rates of unemployment in many other advanced economies. This is the result of community resilience, the success of the stimulus and the combined impact of economic stimulus by other governments around the world, including conservative governments, who understand the importance of intervening in these circumstances to support their economies. The result is that more than 200,000 Australians have kept their jobs and Australia has avoided a very deep recession. But there are some hefty challenges ahead. As we have seen - and as the Prime Minister indicated before - from the meetings over the weekend, there are still challenges and uncertainties in the global economy. The IMF cautioned again this month that the global recovery is uneven, it is not yet self-sustaining and it certainly does remain dependent on policy support.Domestically, our economy does have spare capacity. This was demonstrated yet again by last week's unemployment figures. Unemployment rose a little, with some 670,000 Australians still looking for work. We have to be aware that domestic incomes are still under pressure. There has been a sharp decline in global commodity prices. There has been a cut in hours worked. Company profits are expected to shrink by 3¼ per cent. The reduction in hours worked is equivalent to a loss of around 200,000 full-time jobs. All of these things weigh heavily on incomes. And business investment is expected to fall by 6½ per cent in 2009-10.All of these things mean that we must continue with our stimulus. We judge a gradual withdrawal of stimulus is still the best way to go to support employment and to support small business, unlike those opposite, who want to rip it out and rip out the rug from underneath the recovery. Gradual withdrawal has the full support of the business community in this country. That is why I think all Australians can be proud of what we have achieved together. We have come through the worst of the global recession in a stronger position than any other advanced economy. The government is working just as hard on the post-crisis economy as we did on surviving the crisis itself. We did the hard yards to position ourselves as the strongest performing advanced economy and will do the hard yards to turn this into something much more enduring. In many ways we are just beginning.</DOC>

 - The member for Murray struggles today on this one. The bottom line is that when it comes to resettlement arrangements, as I have said consistently and as the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has said consistently and as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said consistently - and as it applied under those opposite when they were in government - there is a collective responsibility across all 16 resettlement countries. It has been so since the earliest days of the operation of the UNHCR convention back in the 1950s. That is the operation under which we conduct ourselves. We think it is the right way to go. These things will be resolved as appropriate with the UNHCR.We have full confidence in the way in which our officials are handling these matters. We have a border protection committee in the cabinet, chaired by the minister for immigration, which is meeting on a regular basis not simply concerning this particular vessel but against the entire range of challenges in the archipelago, including the large number of interruptions that I referred to before. It is chaired by the minister and has a national security adviser on it and also representatives of the various ministries and agencies and representatives of staffs, who are in there all the time working through the detail of this, as it should be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I know that in her electorate she is supporting her 33 schools, which have received $85 million for 118 projects - great news for Petrie. I had the opportunity last week to visit, with the member for Petrie, two of her local schools: Redcliffe State High and Bald Hills State School, a primary school. Both of these are being transformed by Building the Education Revolution money. I was very impressed when I talked with the principal, the teachers and the students about the difference that these new facilities will make for their education. At Bald Hills State School I talked to the principal, Mr Keith Warwick, about what they were using their $200,000 National School Pride money and their $3 million Primary Schools for the 21st Century money for, and it is being devoted to a new resource and multipurpose hall. The importance of this multipurpose hall - and I am sure members in this place who care about education will be interested - is that this primary school currently has nowhere where it can bring the whole school together. If they want to have a whole-school activity they run the risk of the weather - whether it will be too hot to have children sitting outside or whether it will rain on the event. For events where they do not want to run any weather risk, it now costs them around $1,000 a time to bus the children to adjacent community facilities. No wonder they are identifying this new building as a transformation of their school.As well as transforming schools, this is a program that is supporting jobs. At Bald Hills primary school, we know that that project, which is nearing completion, is currently employing around 15 people. Jobs are going to local firms like Kingswood Cabinets, the G. James roofing company and Intech Security. This is local evidence of what is happening around the nation: the government's nation-building economic stimulus, through Building the Education Revolution, supporting jobs in local communities.We know that unemployment currently stands at around 670,000 Australians. Whilst the peak of unemployment has been revised downwards, we expect unemployment to peak at 6.75 per cent. We need to continue to support Australian jobs by continuing economic stimulus. I can say that, on this side of the House, we will not give up on supporting jobs during the days of the global recession. Clearly, those on the other side of the House already have. Does anybody remember the days when the Leader of the Opposition used to wander around saying, 'It's all about jobs, jobs and jobs.' He does not do that any more. On this side of the House, we will not give up on supporting Australian jobs. On that side of the House, they already have.</DOC>

His electorate is benefiting from the jobs that are going into Kalgoorlie right now as a result of this government's economic strategy. He clearly is not aware of what is going on in his electorate, but of course he might be aware of a little project called the Oakajee Port project, the Commonwealth's first ever investment in our ports. - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I repeat that I am happy for the member for Kalgoorlie to have a debate on the motion that we have put forward, and we might be able to arrange that at some time in this coming fortnight. What those opposite have done is voted against economic stimulus in their own electorates, voted against community infrastructure, voted against the Black Spot Program increase, voted against the rail safety programs, voted against the new ports infrastructure -  - I assure those members opposite - because clearly their tactics committee has decided that they want the opportunity to vote on this motion - that we will be giving them the opportunity over the coming fortnight to vote on this motion, to vote on whether they support infrastructure funding in their own electorates. - No, Mr Speaker. - We have got lists, Mr Speaker. We have got lists of projects right around the nation - 33,000 of them. That is what is on our list: 33,000 economic infrastructure projects that are supporting jobs today in each and every electorate around the nation while building the infrastructure that Australia needs for tomorrow.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lowe for his question. Indeed, on Friday I was in the electorate of Wentworth announcing funding for an infrastructure project as part of our economic stimulus plan - important funding for the Wayside Chapel in Kings Cross. This is an important community institution that has been providing services in Sydney since 1964 for the most vulnerable in our community. But this is also an institution that is in dire trouble. It is in dire trouble because, since 1964, there has been very little physical improvement to the building. The product of ageing, fires and wear and tear on that facility has meant that 40 per cent of it is uninhabitable, meaning that the very existence of this institution was under threat.On Friday I announced that $3 million would be made available - in principle - from the government in order to fund the capital improvement of the Wayside Chapel. It will support jobs in the short term - some 50 jobs. This is a project that is shovel-ready; it is ready to go. The DA has been approved and we can expect work to begin in the first half of 2010.There are also important contributions from the New South Wales government and from individuals and donors in the community. Along with Reverend Graham Long we call upon people - and I am sure the Leader of the Opposition would join this call - to contribute funds so that the fit-out can be made as good as possible and so that the services that Wayside can provide can continue to be provided into the future.This project will also provide opportunities for apprenticeships and traineeships. It is an investment, because, of course, if this facility were not available it would result in a real drain on public finances due to the increased costs of looking after people who would simply fall through the cracks if that facility were not there.It was a very proud day for me on Friday to be with Reverend Long and Tanya Plibersek, the Minister for Housing, and many of the volunteers who make such an extraordinary contribution at Wayside. I spoke to the Leader of the Opposition prior to making the announcement and I know that he was supportive of Wayside, as he has been, along with the member for Sydney, for a long time. Lucy Turnbull is of course also a strong supporter of Wayside. I pay tribute to Reverend Long and all the others. This is an example of the government's economic stimulus projects making a real difference - in the short term, in job creation and in providing an important facility in Sydney and, in the long term, making sure that Wayside Chapel can continue to provide the best of services to the most vulnerable in our community for many years and decades ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member will be fully aware of the fact that he is actually meeting with the Attorney-General at 3.30 on this very matter. I would have thought it was better to prosecute the conclusion of those discussions with the minister on the basis of the correspondence which has already occurred between the minister and the honourable member to bring this to a satisfactory conclusion. Our concern, like all members in this place, is to do whatever is physically possible to support safety and security in communities across Australia, but I would draw your attention to the fact that a meeting is supposed to occur in 15 minutes. - </DOC>

 - I very happy to report that the nation-building economic stimulus package social housing component is bang on track to deliver three-quarters of the homes that we are set to deliver by the end of 2010. More than 3,200 have started and almost 200 are complete, and in the repairs and maintenance area work has been done on 40,000 homes already. In fact, 15,000 homes have benefited from repairs to common areas and 5,500 homes have had major work done to them, the sort of major work that has meant that these houses have been returned to active use where they would have fallen into disrepair and disuse otherwise or where they were already vacant.It was terrific to visit the member for Dawson's electorate recently and see a brand-new housing construction project starting off there in Cannonvale. One of several projects that we visited on that particular trip was six two-bedroom apartments including three units that will be accessible for people with disabilities. The slab had been laid, the external walls were going up and the internal framing was starting on that day as well. I met the project manager for that development, Eamon Carey. His company is a small family-run business on the Whitsunday Coast. He told me that 14 local subcontractors were working on that site every day. The work started in September and will go until April 2010. These are absolutely vital jobs at a time when companies like Eamon Carey's family-run business would have been in trouble with the global financial crisis. That story has been repeated right across the country and right across Queensland. Eighty homes from the nation-building economic stimulus program have been approved in Mackay, Bowen, Proserpine and Cannonvale; 304 homes will be built in Townsville; 300 in Far North Queensland, including 200 in the Cairns region and 80 in the Atherton Tablelands, Innisfail and Ingham; and 571 homes on the Gold Coast.Of course, it is not just the nation-building economic stimulus package that is supporting jobs in housing and construction. In Cairns, when I went to visit the member for Leichhardt's electorate, I met a lovely couple, Sam and Margaret Costa, who had moved into one of the first homes through our National Rental Affordability Scheme. They were a farming couple who had lost their farm due to many years of drought and they had moved to Cairns to be closer to family supports. They had been sleeping with relatives in lounge rooms and I asked Margaret where she thought she would be if she had not found the National Rental Affordability Scheme property. She told me that she thought she would be sleeping under a bridge. This is a couple in their 60s - Margaret is very ill and her husband, who had a tractor roll onto him, is her carer - and they are the type of people who are benefiting from the 100 new affordable rental homes that will be built through the National Rental Affordability Scheme in their area.In Mackay I announced 59 National Rental Affordability Scheme properties. I went to the site where 35 three-bedroom townhouses will be built. They are going to be rented out for $300 a week, a $100 saving for the people who will be moving into those properties - almost $5,000 a year. That makes a huge difference to a family struggling to keep their heads above water. It may even mean some of those families can start saving a deposit for a home of their own. Eighteen months ago when I visited Mackay people told me all the time about rental stress in that area and how residents of Mackay who had been there all their lives were moving out because they could no longer afford a place to rent in Mackay. Conditions are a little better now. Because of the economic downturn, there is less pressure on rentals in that area but, as the economy recovers, that rental pressure will return. I am happy to report that, with each of these National Rental Affordability Scheme properties, tradespeople, architects and planners are involved in their construction and that they will make a huge difference as that rental pressure returns. With each of these homes, the repairs and maintenance and the new construction are supporting jobs right across the trades, including planning and architects. All of them are contributing to a future where people will find an affordable home to rent just a little bit easier.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the member for Mackellar for her question, because unfortunately there has been a degree of inaccurate reporting over the past few months on this matter and I am in a position to set the record straight. - Some members will be astonished to hear that, Mr Speaker. The facts that are available from the annual reports that have recently been presented to the parliament do indicate that of the top 40 agencies' spending on consultancies - and typically that covers virtually the vast bulk of overall spending on consultancies - the figure for the final full year of the Howard government, the 2006-07 year, was $511 million. The figure for the 2007-08 year was $426 million and the figure for the 2008-09 year was $460 million. In other words, in both cases the spending of the Australian government under the Rudd government was substantially lower than that under the Howard government. We are currently completing in the department the analysis of the total figures, but I can indicate that the amount - that is, the total figure for the 2008-09 year for all government agencies - is still well below the figure for the top 40 in the last full year of the Howard government. So the truth is that, under the Rudd government, contrary to media reports in various newspapers, including the Australian Financial Review and the Australian, consultancy spending has gone down very significantly.In a broader sense, it is worth noting that, as a result of the government's reform agenda with respect to procurement, we are seeing savings on a variety of fronts, including IT purchasing, including travel purchasing and including arrangements with respect to both ownership and tenancy of property. We are also seeing savings as a result of the two per cent one-off efficiency dividend that was put in place in last year's budget. In overall terms - and this is a figure that I would commend to the attention of members on both sides of the House - we are seeing savings of approximately $7 billion over six years in the costs of administering government in this country. One modest component of that is a reduction in spending on consultancies. We inherited government from a government that was rolling in money and that was wasting a lot of money on the costs of government, and we are tackling the waste and inefficiency that we inherited and we are substantially reducing the cost of government to Australian taxpayers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. I understand the close attention she has paid to the Montara oil and gas leak. On that note, I am pleased to advise the House that on 3 November PTTEP Australasia, the operator of the Montara oil field, successfully killed the leaking well and the fire that had broken out on the Montara wellhead platform. I extend my appreciation to all those involved for the assistance and hard work they put into killing the well.Bringing the well under control was a great relief to all those involved and to the Australian community. I am also required to advise the House that there is more work to be done to secure the well and to make the facilities safe. For those reasons, on Friday of last week, I met with PTTEP Australasia in Perth to discuss the work that still needs to be done. Unfortunately, the impact of the fire on both the West Atlas drilling rig and the Montara wellhead platform means that this work will take longer than initially expected. Technical options are still under review and PTTEP Australasia is working with the relevant regulators, particularly the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority to ensure that the work is done safely and as soon as possible. All options require access to the Montara wellhead platform and therefore safety case revisions will have to take into account the new hazards introduced following the fire, requiring very careful consideration by PTTEP Australasia and careful assessment by NOPSA.I also emphasise that, before personnel are able to undertake any activity at either facility, the operator must provide NOPSA with evidence that all risks have been comprehensively assessed and that control measures are in place to reduce the risk to a level that is as low as is reasonably practical. Concurrent with this work, I announced the commencement of the Montara commission of inquiry on 5 November, although I first flagged this on 7 September. -  - I appreciate the interest of the House in this important matter. - As I was indicating - and I am sure that the member for Sturt is very interested in this matter - it is important that we seek to understand the cause of the incident, that we learn from it and that we put in place any measures that could stop it from happening again. For those reasons I appointed Mr David Borthwick, the former secretary of the department of the environment, to conduct the inquiry in accordance with the amendments supported by the House to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act. Those amendments provide a broad-ranging major incident investigation power for the commissioner.I also note that the commissioner will consider the environmental impacts of the incident including reviewing environmental monitoring laws. In the last couple of years there have been four serious oil and gas incidents, two during tropical cyclone Billy involving vessels used in petroleum production activities, the recent Montara accident and the Varanus gas explosion, which effectively meant Western Australia lost 30 per cent of its energy supplies for a considerable period.I note that these facilities involve incidents which are regulated by a combination of Commonwealth, Western Australian and Northern Territory agencies. Each of these events has been or will continue to be subject to independent investigations. I can assure the House that I will be acting on the recommendations of those independent investigations.</DOC>

I notice, for example, that our relations recently with China have involved contact with multiple members of the senior leadership. There was recently a full day's visit in New Delhi dealing with our relationship with India, and a range of others. The more the opposition bellow the more we know they are in trouble. The member for Curtin asks about our relationship with Indonesia and the visit by the Indonesian President. As I said to the House yesterday, we welcome his visit. We welcome the opportunity for him to address this parliament, and the arrangements concerning him have been the subject of continuing discussion between the two sides.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, as I know that climate change has been on the minds of many members of this House on both sides of the chamber today. It was certainly a matter for discussion within the Australian Labor Party party room today, as I understand it has been within the coalition party room. Businesses around the world agree and are calling for action at the national and international level, because what businesses want is business certainty for the future. The Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change has called for an ambitious, robust and equitable global deal on climate change that responds to the scale and urgency of the crisis facing the world today. In fact the group - which represents 700 companies around the world from the US, the EU, Japan, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Russia, China and South America - signed up for the communique, including such companies as the National Australia Bank, Insurance Australia Group, Lend Lease, Westpac, Woolworths and Linfox. The group released the Copenhagen Communique on Climate Change, which stated: 'The one thing we do not have is time. Delay is not an option.' These comments have been reflected at home as well, including by the Chief Executive of Australian Industry Group when she said, most recently:Many of our members are telling us that they are holding off making investments until there is a greater degree of clarity around domestic climate change legislation.The government is committed to action on climate change at home and abroad. We are obviously engaged with our counterparts around the world on the negotiation of an agreement for Copenhagen as we are active here in Australia in seeking passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation through the Australian Senate. As a sign of good faith, as I indicated to the House yesterday, to the negotiations we have underway with the opposition, the government is prepared to exclude agricultural emissions from coverage under the CPRS. This reflected carefully upon observations made by many members in their contribution to this debate, including our good friend and colleague the member for Warringah, who stated recently, 'Our minimum conditions are that it must exclude agriculture.' Also our good friend and colleague the member for Groom has said:Agriculture is obviously a key issue. I would say quite openly that if agriculture is not included in the package the party room won't agree to carry the amendments.I say to those opposite that we have been entirely mindful of some of the internal political realities that those opposite have had to confront in their good faith negotiations with the government. We further welcome statements made, as reported today in the Sydney Morning Herald, again by our good friend the member for Groom, who is the opposition spokesman and negotiator on the CPRS, in which he said, 'I'm still optimistic of a deal.' I thank the member for Groom for providing leadership on this question because we know that these negotiations are complex - the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is complex - and we know that these are difficult matters to resolve. But, of course, the nation must resolve them. I also note the comments made in the debate in the House of Representatives yesterday by the member for Kooyong. I quote the member for Kooyong, who I am sure obtains the support of all good Liberals there opposite:The response to climate change needs to be a global response and it is essential that Australia makes its contribution to addressing world emissions by implementing an emissions trading scheme that will impose a price on carbon.That was well said by the member for Kooyong and, of course, he reflects the historical position on climate change over the years from the Leader of the Opposition and other spokesmen from those opposite. We have now entered into the final two weeks of sittings in the Senate, which are to be devoted to this legislation. The legislation was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday and will be introduced into the Senate today. There will be opportunity in the Senate for every senator to speak on this debate - full opportunity. There will be time for every amendment to be considered in detail in this debate. Further, the government is willing to extend parliamentary sittings to accommodate any further contributions to this debate and I know members of the press gallery nod in agreement as they would like this debate to continue.I say also to those opposite, to the House and to the country at large that we have noticed with concern, however, the following actions which were taken by the coalition half an hour or so ago in the Senate, and this I would draw to the House's attention. The government moved today to extend hours to allow comprehensive consideration of the CPRS. The coalition just voted against the motion in the Senate. As a result, the Senate will not be sitting extended hours to debate the CPRS bill tonight. So, after a year or two in preparation, those are the circumstances we are now confronted with.As a further note of concern, and I would again draw this to the House's attention, the coalition then opposed the commencement of the CPRS debate today. As a result the CPRS debate will not be commencing today in the Senate. We have three days left this week; one has now gone. We have four days left next week to debate what is arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation for the nation, for the economy and for the year ahead, and this is the advice that we have so far received. I hope to be advised by the Leader of the Opposition that there has been some error on the part of those in the other place. Given the importance of this legislation, it is concerning that the coalition in the Senate appears to be acting in a way which is inconsistent with what we have found to be fruitful, good-faith negotiations here in the House. I look forward to an alternative view being expressed by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - Once again I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question as, of course, he moves away from the point he has been so active on in debate over the last 24 hours, which is his accusation that I misled the House on my knowledge of the contents of the Jakarta embassy's immigration document, which was the subject of his questions yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition said without doubt that the Prime Minister had misled the House on this matter. 
An opposition member - Hear, hear! - I hear the 'hear, hears' from those opposite; therefore I have this uncanny sense of deja vu. When was the last time we had this Leader of the Opposition stand up and say that I had misled the House on such a matter? What we had last time was, of course, the forged email affair around Utegate when the Leader of the Opposition stood up and made an accusation publicly that I had misled the parliament on the basis of no evidence at all, which perhaps explains why he was crab-walking a million miles away from his accusation on the doors this morning. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Was this yet another example of the Leader of the Opposition simply shooting from the lip and hoping that something might materialise by fax or email at a subsequent occasion? We have seen this before. The honourable gentleman's question goes to the consistency of government policy and its approach to these matters. I refer again to the letter from the secretary of the immigration department, who was also the secretary of the immigration department under the previous Australian government, which says that the Indonesian government and the Australian government have agreed to a set of arrangements regarding time frames for the processing of the group in Indonesia, consistent with international practice and resettlement procedures. I draw that again to the Leader of the Opposition's attention as it was a letter I tabled in the House yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is the centrepiece of the government's measures to tackle the threat of climate change. The greatest barrier to the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is the disunity of the opposition. It is clear, of course, and has been for some time that the coalition is clearly split, with the Nationals having gone off on their own course of action. The Liberal and National parties are fundamentally divided over the issue of climate change.Senator Joyce is spearheading the campaign against the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme even to the detriment of rural communities. The government announced over the weekend that we would agree to exclude agricultural emissions from the operation of the CPRS indefinitely as part of a package negotiated with the opposition. In addition to that, the government indicated that we would consider a range of ways in which the agriculture sector could reduce its emissions, including by it being able to generate offsetting credits. It is a significant step that would allow farmers the incentive to sequester carbon. The NFF, the National Farmers Federation, and other farming groups have welcomed that move. What has Senator Joyce got to say about this issue? When asked on Four Corners, Senator Joyce, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, had this to say to that question. - Senator Joyce was asked on Four Corners: 'Do you want carbon offsets for the farming community?' Senator Joyce's reply was: 'No. And I want a little red car for Christmas and, if I can, I will take cupid wings and fly around the room.' That is the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. It is not a wonder he is doing the chicken dance if that is what he is endeavouring to do. Senator Joyce has taken his party far beyond the edge of relevance and credibility in this debate.But the problem is not just the National Party. The Liberals appear to have fallen into two camps on this particular issue. The first camp, led by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Groom, are obviously supporting negotiations with the government. We are wondering whether the member for Mackellar might be one of the 10 people in the Liberal party room today who, we understand, did not support that position. -  - Uncle Wilson has come to the wedding. That is the first camp. The second camp is the one populated by the climate change sceptics. No lesser political figure than the Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, Senator Minchin, sees the global efforts to combat climate change as some form of international left-wing conspiracy - a new communist front. This is what he had to say on the Four Corners show:For the extreme left it provides the opportunity to do what they've always wanted to do, to sort of de-industrialise the western world. You know the collapse of communism was a disaster for the left, and the, and really they embraced environmentalism as their new religion.This is the leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate carrying on about a communist conspiracy that is the basis for taking action against climate change. This puts all the major world leadership, including other political figures and including the Leader of the Opposition, in a communist conspiracy. That is what climate change is all about, according to Senator Minchin.But we have the other side of the spectrum represented in the Liberal Party as well. The member for Hume had a different take on this issue in his second reading contribution on the bills. Instead, he suggested that climate change science is the modern equivalent of Nazi science. This is what he had to say:The climate change debate is not new. On 4 June 1940, Sir Winston Churchill warned of the perverted science of national socialist ideology when he uttered the words:_ the whole world -  - This is what the member for Hume had to say:The climate change debate is not new. On 4 June 1940, Sir Winston Churchill warned of the perverted science of national socialist ideology when he uttered the words: -  - I know you do not like hearing it, but you are going to hear it. This is what he quoted of Sir Winston Churchill:_ the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.The member for Hume then went on to say:That is just as applicable today to the perverted science of global warming.That is unbelievable. That is a completely incredible contribution. For political figures with the responsibility of people such as the member for Hume and the Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, Senator Minchin, to engage in such bizarre, ridiculous and absurd nonsense is extremely irresponsible, given the threat that this country faces. No modern political party can be held captive by climate change sceptics and hope to retain credibility.The Prime Minister made the point earlier that the member for Groom had indicated some optimism that a potential agreement with the government may obtain support in the Liberal party room. We hope that is the case. We continue to approach these negotiations in good faith. We will endeavour to secure an agreement and we are hopeful that it will obtain support in the Liberal party room because it is important to this country's national interest to tackle the threat of climate change. The sceptics and the extremists need to be cast to the edge.</DOC>

 - Once again, the Leader of the Opposition's question carries within it the assumption that there is a second set of circumstances other than those that pertain to the general application of Australian and Indonesian arrangements under these circumstances with the UNHCR. I simply go back to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said. Recently, he said quite clearly in a radio interview that, firstly, this vessel was picked up in the course of a search and rescue operation. That is a fact. Secondly, when the vessel was brought ashore, consistent with the approval of Indonesian authorities, the normal application of processes applied. This was, again, underlined yesterday in a letter, which provides such profound discomfort for those opposite, from the secretary of our immigration department - and previously of their immigration department - where, quite clearly, he says: 'The Indonesian government and the Australian government have agreed to a set of arrangements regarding the time frames for the processing of the group in Indonesia, consistent with international practice and resettlement procedures.' Again, I simply draw that to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition.I go back to the extraordinary attempt that the Leader of the Opposition has made in the last 24 hours to accuse me, once again, of misleading the parliament on my knowledge of the content of the document put forward by the Jakarta embassy. He said that quite explicitly. He said that I had misled the parliament on that matter. This is a grave accusation. He said it once before, this year, and that was in relation to the Utegate affair, which was based on a forged email. My question to the Leader of the Opposition when he stands to his feet next time is: will he provide to us the evidence upon which he has based this most recent baseless accusation?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. It is a very important question because, each and every year we delay, the cost of responding to climate change gets larger and larger. We on this side of the House very clearly understand the economic cost of delay. The economic cost of delay puts a greater burden on the Australian economy, on Australian business and on Australian workers and on subsequent generations. We understand the urgency of dealing with dangerous climate change and we on this side of the House know that, the earlier we act, the more we can lessen those costs in the long term, the more we will lessen those burdens on Australian business and lessen those burdens on Australian households that are imposed on them by dangerous climate change. But, unfortunately, there are many on that side of the House who do not even accept the science of dangerous climate change.We have extremists on that side of the House, dinosaurs on that side of the House, who do not accept the science or the economics of dangerous climate change. Apparently, in the party room today there were 10 speakers, six from the Liberal Party, denying the science and denying the need to act. We have already seen the member for O'Connor put up his hand and indicate that he is a dinosaur, we have the member for Tangney over there putting up his hand and I think we have the member for Mackellar over there. Who are the other three? Are they going to identify themselves in the House today? We have one on the front bench, have we? We have several on the front bench, apparently, because it is okay for the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to question the science of climate change. There are clearly many dinosaurs on that side of the House, and most particularly in the Senate, who do not understand the most basic aspect of economics: to protect our future prosperity, to protect our country, to protect our sustainability, we need to deal with dangerous climate change.This is understood in most countries of the world and, in most countries of the world, it is understood by both sides of politics. When we go to international meetings we sit there with leaders from conservative parties throughout the world who absolutely understand the importance of addressing dangerous climate change, who are willing to sit down and protect subsequent generations and deal with it and who clearly outline their support for the science. But it appears, just like it was with the economic stimulus, there is a hard core of extremists in the conservative parties in this country who do not understand the importance of the economics or the science of climate change.We do have one international organisation. They are not known radicals, they are not communist members of the G20, but they do understand the risk and the cost of dangerous climate change. It is that radical organisation the International Energy Agency - a very radical body, stacked with communists and other radicals from around the world who understand the cost of climate change. This is what they had to say about the economic cost of climate change and why it is urgent that we deal with it: 'As every day passes it gets more urgent and, as every year passes, it gets more urgent.' But these basic empirical facts are lost on those members of the Liberal and National parties who spoke in the party room today, opposing the science of climate change. This is what the International Energy Agency had to say. They found that every year of delay means that more intense carbon reductions will be required down the track, which, common sense tells you, come at a higher cost. For every year of delay, before moving to a more sustainable emissions path, an extra US$500 billion is added to the global bill for mitigating climate change - a global bill that is already estimated at US$10.5 trillion over the period 2010 to 2030. And, of course, that only applies for one to three years. The costs are even greater if we do not act against dangerous climate change.We have also seen the report from the World Wildlife Fund 'Climate change 2', which sets out the fact that we need urgent investment to transform our economy. Now, here is the immediate rub. If we do not take a positive decision on the CPRS, what we are going to do is hold up millions and millions of dollars of investment in our economy. Action to delay the CPRS in the Senate is going to starve our businesses of future investment and it will starve new industries of vital job creation investment. So there is a lot on the line and it goes to the core not just of sustainability of our climate but to the very core of our economic prosperity. But none of these things are understood by the 10 dinosaurs in the party room who spoke up today and denied the climate change science. Those dinosaurs are absolutely intent on smashing our national economic interest in the Senate of this parliament. We on this side of the House will fight for the CPRS every inch of the way, because it goes to the core of our national interest - our national economic interest and our national environmental interest.</DOC>

 - As the Leader of the Opposition would be aware, dealing with each vessel involves particular circumstances. I simply draw his attention, for example, to those confronted by the Indonesian government in dealing with those currently on the boat at Merak. What are the circumstances there? One, the vessel was picked up in Indonesian waters. Two, as a result of it being picked up in Indonesian waters it was taken to Indonesia and, as a result, it is being processed under Indonesian law. That is what has occurred with the vessel at Merak.It was picked up in the Indonesian search and rescue zone as a consequence of contact with the Indonesian search and rescue authorities. An Australian vessel was asked to intervene. I assume those opposite are not suggesting that we should in any way ignore a request for support under those circumstances, though from time to time I have heard eerie silences on the part of those opposite on this question and, furthermore, those opposite have not provided any simple answer to this question. Having answered an international search and rescue call, where should the individual vessel then be taken - to Indonesia or to Australia? We, responding to the arrangements that we had made with the Indonesians, took it to Indonesia and that is why the circumstances which govern its handling now are the product of Australian processes, Indonesian processes and international processes, unlike the vessel which is currently offshore at Merak.I simply go back, therefore, to the honourable gentleman's question, which goes to this vessel and other vessels in the circumstances which pertain. I go again to the advice provided by the secretary to the immigration department who, much to his discomfort and the discomfort of all those opposite, has said that the Indonesian government and the Australian government have agreed to a set of arrangements regarding the time frames for the processing of the group in Indonesia, consistent with the international practices and resettlement procedures. That is his advice. That is how we are applying it. The individual physical circumstances concerning the interdiction of a vessel have to be considered, depending on where it is located in international waters; search and rescue obviously are different and therefore, under the circumstances -  -  - I would suggest to those opposite, once again, that they seem to be remarkably robust on this question that when it comes to answering a search and rescue call you should not under any circumstances adhere to the normal processes which apply to the Indonesians and apply to others - which are that you take it to the nearest port with the concurrence of the local authorities. That is what occurred in these circumstances. Yet I note, again, in his third question today on this matter, the Leader of the Opposition has refused to back in his accusation that the Prime Minister of the country - me - misled parliament yesterday on the question of my own knowledge of the document which was released by the immigration section of our embassy in Jakarta.If the member for Wentworth is going to stand to his feet as he did yesterday and accuse the Prime Minister of the country of misleading the parliament, you would hope that even this Leader of the Opposition - who is so experienced in these matters, given the events of the middle of this year - would have one shred of evidence upon which to base that accusation. But, so far, not one shred of evidence has he advanced in support of his accusation that I misled the parliament yesterday concerning knowledge or authorisation of that particular document. That is the accusation he made. He said, 'There is no question about it, whatsoever.'The government's policy on border protection is consistent. We are applying it to a difficult set of circumstances around the world. I would suggest that those opposite, instead of simply seeking to cultivate the politics of fear on this question, engage in a real policy debate about this. What is your alternative policy on immigration? I have not heard it so far, other than to bring back the temporary protection visas, it seems, which resulted in 100 boats coming here with 10,000 asylum seekers in the two years following that. That is the one addition we have had to the policy. And, secondly, when asked how would you handle the circumstances which govern the particular interdiction of the vessel which the Minister for Foreign Affairs was speaking of yesterday, they say, 'That is a question for the government, not for us.' So they have no policy in terms of the alternative for the future and no alternative approach in terms of the operational circumstances which pertain to this vessel. As the secretary of the immigration department said yesterday, 'We are adhering to processes in this group in Indonesia, which are consistent with international practice and resettlement procedures.' I would suggest the Leader of the Opposition actually read carefully that letter and reflect on its content before he makes a further accusation, which is baseless, concerning myself and misleads the parliament - as he did, without foundation, yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I know he has many in his constituency who are genuinely interested in the government's energy efficiency policies. The fact is that a comprehensive approach to energy efficiency is absolutely important in tackling the dangers of climate change. It is the government's second plank in its approach. Sometimes it is called 'the quiet achiever'. Here the government is taking up unprecedented action to improve energy efficiency across the Australian economy. The evidence is clear. The International Energy Agency - and the Treasurer briefly and recently quoted them in the House - identify energy efficiency as providing substantial emission reductions out to 2030 under a 450 parts per million reference scenario.I was pleased to announce last week that for the first time Australian governments have agreed to a new national scheme to approve the energy efficiency of commercial office buildings by introducing regulations that will require owners to provide energy efficiency information when selling or leasing. This is a very important announcement. It means that, starting in the second half of 2010, this disclosure scheme will be a real driver for green innovation and competition in the commercial office market, creating clean energy jobs as well. The scheme will also apply to office buildings owned by the Australian government.I also recently announced that new energy efficiency standards for TVs, household lighting and whitegoods were now in place. People listening may not think that this is a critical measure, but the statistics are clear. The equipment energy efficiency programs are expected to prevent up to 19.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions every year by 2020, a saving to the Australian economy of up to $22 billion over the next 16 years and a saving to Australian householders of up to $5 billion per year by 2020. These are substantial savings to the economy and substantial savings in greenhouse gas emission reductions. That is what energy efficiency is all about. Of course, since February this year the government's Energy Efficient Homes Package has provided ceiling insulation for over 600,000 Australian households and solar hot water for around another 100,000. To put this in perspective: since February the Rudd government have made around one in 12 Australian households more energy efficient. Over the rollout we will have reached more than one-quarter of Australian homes, reducing emissions from those households by up to 30 million tonnes by 2020.These are tangible and real achievements that this government has made. Energy efficiency measures are often called complementary measures, because effective action on energy efficiency complements an effective price for carbon. That is the price that comes with having a carbon pollution reduction scheme. They are both critical parts of a comprehensive approach to tackling dangerous climate change. This week in parliament we have the opportunity to put that in place - that is, to put in place a comprehensive approach marrying these energy efficiency measures that the government has brought forward by agreeing to a carbon pollution reduction scheme. So it is down to the opposition, with possibly seven days of debate left, as we begin the final countdown. I could not help but notice reports today of the opposition party room that the opposition leader actually faces an ETS revolt from some 10 MPs - six Liberals and four Nationals, it is reported. It is reported that they would vote down the laws 'come what may'. It is time for the opposition to show itself in this debate. The report also says:_ the opposition foreign affairs spokesman said Australia must have a debate about energy security and alternatives._ she had complained 19 out of 20 G20 countries were pursuing nuclear power.'It is time to have a mature debate,' she said.All I can say to the member opposite is: let's have a mature debate about a carbon pollution reduction scheme. Instead, we have some 10 opposition members defiant, opposing their own leader in the party room on a carbon pollution reduction scheme. I know they are starting to arc up when we ask them who is opposing the opposition leader on moving ahead on a carbon pollution reduction scheme. They are quite often fond of quoting lyrics to me. Seeing that we are in the final countdown, I thought I would read the lyrics of The Final Countdown. They looked relevant to me, so I thought I would read them out. This is a soundtrack for the opposition at the moment. The lyrics read:We're leaving togetherBut it's still farewellAnd maybe we'll come backTo earth, who can tell?_            _            _Oh, we're heading for Venus - That reminded me of a report that they did in the previous parliament about carbon emissions on other planets. It continues:And still we stand tallCause maybe they've seen usAnd welcome to us allWith so many light years to goAnd things to be found _The one thing the opposition should find is a policy and the one thing the opposition leader should find is some leadership to lead his party to deliver a carbon pollution reduction scheme to the Australian people. It is in the national interest, it is in the international interest and the countdown is on.</DOC>

 - So we get to question 4 and finally we go to the substance of the challenge against me yesterday: that I had misled the parliament in terms of my knowledge of the Jakarta embassy immigration section's document concerning these matters. Instead now we engage in the supposed forensics of who, what and when in terms of the operations of the border protection committee. As I said to the House yesterday, the border protection committee of our cabinet has responsibility for these and other matters concerning people smuggling and border protection.Secondly, it is chaired by the immigration minister and has representation from other relevant ministers, other relevant bureaucrats and other relevant staff including my own. Thirdly, a number of my own staff would be on it from time to time. That is the normal way in which you handle things. But once again we find ourselves with the Leader of the Opposition trying to crab-walk his way out of responsibility. What was the basis yesterday of his charge that I had misled the parliament? Was it another forged email? Was it a concocted fax? Was it some other manufactured document or simply a counterfeit smoke signal?</DOC>

 - Together with the defence minister I visited our troops at Tarin Kowt last week and spent time with them and spent time also with of course their commanders and with the United States commander responsible for the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, General McChrystal. It was an opportunity to meet with our troops serving in Afghanistan in what is a very difficult and challenging operating environment. In addition to meeting our troops, we were able to be briefed fully on the proposed plans ahead for dealing with what is a difficult and mounting insurgency in the south of the country. General McChrystal was able to brief me on the operations of ISAF in Afghanistan, the challenges he faces and the strategy he is proposing for the future. General McChrystal also expressed to me his appreciation for the work that Australian forces were doing in Oruzgan province. He praised the work that they do highly as well as those Australian embedded staff who are working within his own command and General Rodriguez's command in Kabul and also command operations out of Kandahar. He made the point that providing security in Oruzgan, including through training the Afghan national security forces, was a critical part of the international mission in Afghanistan. I also met with our diplomats, our Federal Police representatives, our development assistance representatives and other professionals based in Afghanistan. It was useful to receive at firsthand from them and from serving officers information on the challenges they face in what will be a particularly difficult year ahead. Also I was privileged to be able to attend, with the troops there and the defence minister and General McChrystal, our Remembrance Day ceremonies at Tarin Kowt. We were also able to reflect upon the contribution of the 11 soldiers who have so far given their lives in that conflict.I also had the chance to engage with representatives of the Afghan government during my visit. I spoke to President Karzai on the phone when I was there. He was in Kabul. I congratulated him on his return to office. I also said, in my conversation with him, that Australia was committed to Afghanistan for the long haul but we also expect much from our Afghanistan partners in deliverance of better governance to the Afghan people in the future. In Tarin Kowt I was also able to meet with the governor of Oruzgan province, Governor Hamdam, and the Minister for Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Mohammed Ehsan Zia. Through their combined efforts we are also, together with our own aid agencies and the work of the reconstruction task force, involved in much good reconstruction work. I was able to be briefed firsthand on the building of schools, the building of health centres and the building of other much-needed supports including bridges and roads, which our troops and the aid agencies are actively engaged in. This is all part and parcel of supporting the civilian arm of what must be an integrated civilian and military strategy in Afghanistan for the future. As I have said previously, our mission in Afghanistan is difficult and it is dangerous. In spite of the difficulties our troops are doing a first-class job and those who are engaged with our troops, such as the Americans and the Dutch, acknowledge the professionalism of all those Australians active in the field.The mission is making demonstrable progress within our province, Oruzgan, disrupting insurgent networks, increasing training for Afghan battalions as part of the 4th Brigade of the Afghan national army, which we are seeking to raise through our training effort and the combined efforts of others. Also, we have expanded the area in which Afghan security forces provide protection to local communities. Importantly, we have developed our own integrated civilian-military strategy that also focuses on the building and reconstruction effort within the province. I referred to some of those examples just before. Australia remains committed to our mission in Afghanistan. It is a vital mission, one that helps to deny Afghanistan as a safe haven for terrorists. As the debate on Afghanistan continues to unfold in our community, let us never forget the reasons why we are there through our unified joint resolution of this House back in the end part of 2001. That is our reflection on what happened to our American ally from the events of September 11: the terrorist attacks on the United States, in New York and in Washington and elsewhere, and therefore our common resolve not to allow Afghanistan again to become a safe haven for the operation of terrorist organisations in the future and, building on that, to raise also the effectiveness of the Afghan security forces - the army, the police and its civilian infrastructure - to ensure that the Afghans can in time take responsibility for the administration of that province. That is our mission within the country. It is a mission which is specific to the problems of Oruzgan together with the combined efforts of our embedded forces in both Kandahar and Kabul. We intend to be in Afghanistan for the long haul.</DOC>

 - As I have said in response to the honourable member's questions yesterday and today, the border protection committee of the cabinet has responsibility operationally for the handling of these matters. I said also, in response to the honourable member's question yesterday, that my own staff, together with the staff of other ministers and officials from my own department and officials from other ministers' departments, are active in that committee, a committee which is chaired under normal circumstances by the immigration minister. That is how it operates; that is how it is extended here. - The question goes to the operation of the border protection committee, the operation of my staff on that committee and what would normally be the relationship between any staff and their minister. Of course, I am aware, as Prime Minister, of the fact that negotiations are underway with various agencies, including the Indonesians and others. That would be normal. On the content of those negotiations, on the content of the agreement which is referred to, contained in the document about which he said that I had misled the parliament yesterday, I had no prior knowledge of its content and I did not authorise its content. But I note once again, consistent with what we have had on earlier occasions, an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to embroil my staff in this matter. I seem to remember what he did during the forged email affair on Utegate, which was to seek to embroil the economic adviser in my office, Dr Charlton. Once again, we are going down the same road.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. I know that she would have been delighted that seven schools in her electorate are receiving more than $10 million as a result of the recent announcement of round 2 of trade training colleges. I was very pleased to be able to travel with the member for Gorton to his electorate, to the Catholic Regional College in Sydenham, to make this announcement on 5 November. In round 2 of our Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, 92 projects in 302 schools are receiving $384 million. This is great news. Of course, this round 2 was bumped up by $110 million extra, which was pulled forward as part of the economic stimulus package.We know that members opposite did not support the economic stimulus package and did not support this investment in trade training centres in schools. Indeed, the shadow education minister, the member for Sturt, said in those debates:In the package that has been announced there is a description of the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program as having received an outstanding response from schools across the country. The unreality of that statement struck me in its tendency towards Maoism.The member for Sturt went on to say:How absolutely ludicrous!These overblown words follow the consistent and wrong claims of the member for Sturt that somehow funding to schools has been cut in this program. That is a completely untrue claim which he repeats and repeats. But people in education know the truth, which is that this program is being rolled out exactly as promised, with schools eligible for between half a million dollars and $1½ million, and many schools choose to put their money together to get a bigger and more diverse facility. But those are the words of the member for Sturt: 'Maoism' and 'How absolutely ludicrous'.I can inform the House that, against that basis, I have found a Maoist on the Liberal backbench. I can see the Leader of the Opposition is interested in this news. He is about to write the name down, with a purge coming - a Maoist on the Liberal backbench. It will strike you as a name you would not have predicted. He is a conservative-looking bloke; you would not pick him as a Maoist. It is the member for Parkes: the Maoist on the Liberal backbench. There he is: the Maoist on the Liberal backbench. If you are going to come out as a Maoist, you might as well do it in a newspaper called the Daily Liberal. Where else would you possibly do it? In his column 'Coulton's Catch-up', he says the following about trade training centres:This week, I am delighted to announce that several schools in the Parkes electorate will receive funding for trade training centres.The waxing lyrical about trade training centres goes on paragraph after paragraph, school after school, as he lists the six projects in his electorate receiving over $20 million in funding. The Maoist on the Liberal backbench goes on to say:Access to premium education facilities is extremely important for students, particularly those living in regional areas. Many students are often interested in pursuing a trade and these centres allow students access to training opportunities while still at school.The member for Parkes goes on:It's a great initiative which creates a new generation of skilled and qualified workers for our region - something that we are desperately in need of.The member for Parkes is right: his region is in need as a result of more than a decade of neglect by the Howard government. And he is right: the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program is a great initiative. The only person who ends up looking absolutely ludicrous at the end of this is the member for Sturt.</DOC>

 - I always welcome questions from the member for Curtin. She would always, I would hope, remember, in those deep, dark days in the past when she was a cabinet minister, that there is such a thing as how cabinet committees operate. Ours operate on the same grounds of confidentiality as theirs, with one exception: Minister Turnbull is not a minister of our cabinet, so it does not leak on a regular basis as theirs did. We all know the practice in times past: out the door and constant background briefings with the chaps upstairs about what was going on in the cabinet. Ours does not operate that way; it operates under standard cabinet procedures. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to move his censure motion, he should get on with it and defend his accusation yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hunter for his question and for his advocacy of the Hunter Expressway - a very important infrastructure development that is getting underway under the Rudd government. This morning I have announced that we are moving forward on three important road projects in New South Wales. In the Hunter we have selected the private alliance that will help build the eastern section of the Hunter Expressway along with the RTA. This clears the way for construction work on this long overdue project to commence early next year. There was $1.5 billion allocated in this year's federal budget with construction work scheduled to start within months. It will support up to 800 jobs in the short term while building the infrastructure that we need for the Hunter in the long term.On the New South Wales mid-North Coast we have also selected the private alliance that will work with the RTA to deliver the Kempsey bypass. There was $618 million allocated in this year's federal budget and 450 jobs, boosting the region's local economy. Importantly, we are wasting no time to commence further work on the Pacific Highway. This morning I announced that we are investing $57.6 million in conjunction with the New South Wales government to get the Frederickton to Eungai section of the highway shovel ready. The horrific Kempsey bus crash, which claimed 35 lives, happened on this section of road almost 20 years ago. Despite this, the necessary planning and pre-construction work to duplicate this section of road has not yet been done. Under the Nation Building Program we are making it a key priority to get this project ready for construction. This pre-construction work will identify potential engineering challenges, calculate accurate costings, undertake the necessary land acquisition and determine a reliable construction timetable. This will all enable us to begin major construction on this project following the completion of the Kempsey bypass.The Rudd Labor government is investing some $3.1 billion over six years on the Pacific Highway - close to three times as much as the coalition spent over double the period of time. Over 12 years the coalition spent $1.3 billion; under this government $3.1 billion over six years. We are committed to delivering better and safer roads. This is important. It is creating jobs in the short term while building the infrastructure that this nation needs for the long term.</DOC>

 - Once again, this reminds me of the lead-up we had to the Leader of the Opposition's last censure motion a couple of weeks ago which did not actually proceed, but I am sure this one will proceed on this occasion. There should be a little more subtlety in the build-up to a censure motion, in my view. Let me go to the elements he has raised, as he asked, 'When did the border protection committee meet?' This committee meets on a continuing basis. There are multiple meetings of it, as is normal when you have an ongoing operation. So the answer to the question about when it met on this particular matter is simply that it has met on a number of occasions over the period of time that this and related operations concerning people smuggling have been underway.He asked further whether this particular decision of the border protection committee of the cabinet has been properly recorded. All decisions of cabinet committees are properly recorded. Furthermore, when it comes to cabinet committees and their normal operation, given one is chaired by a senior cabinet minister, in this case the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and advised by staff, I have full confidence in the operations of the committee. If the honourable gentleman has further questions to ask about these operational elements of the cabinet committee, I would simply refer him to this point: we act entirely consistently in a manner in which a cabinet committee operates as outlined in the cabinet handbookas I thought would have operated in the case of their cabinet handbook with the single exception of course that the Leader of the Opposition, when minister for the environment, would constantly leak on his cabinet colleagues, including the then Prime Minister.Again, if the Leader of the Opposition is proceeding in the direction of his censure motion, as I assume that he is, can I say to him that I am all ears to hear his substantiation for the charge he made in this precinct yesterday. He held a press conference once he left this chamber yesterday, having heard my responses, and said that I had misled the parliament in terms of my knowledge and approval of the particular document issued by the Jakarta embassy's immigration councillor. That is his charge. He has not retracted that charge. I look forward to him in his censure motion adducing the evidence to underpin that charge.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I know that he is concerned about access to education by country students. Unfortunately, the Liberal and National parties in government were not at all concerned about access to education by country students. In the last five years of the Liberal-National Party government, the participation rates of country kids in universities went down. That is their track record in office. Whilst the participation rates of country kids went down, there were kids living at home in families that earned more than $300,000 a year who were getting full youth allowance. That is what they call equity in the Liberal Party and the National Party - the wealthiest families in the country getting full youth allowance as students live at home whilst country kids have their ability to participate in university cut.We are resolved to fix that and the bill before the Senate does address that. We have listened to the concerns of students in a transition year who need to leave home in order to study and we have responded to those concerns. Yesterday the higher education sector came out and said to the Liberal and National parties: 'Get out of the way. Pass this bill.' Representatives of every Australian university and representatives of students said to the Liberal and National parties, 'Get out of the way and pass this bill.' Of the people who spoke, Ian Chubb, the Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, speaking on behalf of the Group of Eight universities, said:Well we as a Group of 8 support this Bill. We think that it's particularly important that it pass, that it pass quickly so that we can give some information to and certainty to the students _Ross Milbourne, the Vice-Chancellor of UTS, representing the Australian Technology Network of Universities, said:I speak really with my other fellow Vice Chancellors on behalf of the entire higher education sector who's unanimous on supporting the legislation._            _            __ from my perspective, failure to pass this legislation today is not only bad for the education system in Australia, but it's bad social policy and is very bad long term economic policy.Paul Johnson, the Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University, speaking on behalf of the Innovative Research Universities, said:These students and their parents are having a tough time at present, we all know of the problems in the economy of regional and rural Australia. The proposed legislation will make a fundamental difference to all these families, all these students and their mums and dads.Then we had the representative of the National Union of Students, on behalf of students, David Barrow, who said:Let me just say that students unequivocally support these new scholarships.So in positioning to reject this legislation the Liberal and National parties are ignoring the united and unanimous voice of everybody who speaks on behalf of higher education in this country. You could not be more isolated, you could not be more wedded to an inequitable and unfair system than those opposite. But having not been a friend of students in government, they are determined to be antistudent in opposition. They are particularly determined to be anti the participation of regional students in universities. The amendments that the opposition is moving in the Senate rip $700 million out of scholarships on an ongoing basis, $160 million of it coming out of the scholarships going to country kids - $160 million ripped out of the hands of country kids. That is what the opposition stands for.As inequitable and unfair and irresponsible as their amendments are, what is even worse is that we do not know whether, if their amendments fail - and obviously they will be defeated again in this House if they succeed in the Senate - when it comes to considering the final proposition, they will pass this bill or reject this bill. We do not know what they will do. Let me just explain to members opposite who are catcalling what rejection of this bill will mean and what they will need to say to their constituents when they go back home. - The member for Kalgoorlie is asking what he will tell his constituents. I will give him some facts. If this bill is rejected almost 25,000 families with incomes between $32,800 and $44,165 will miss out on their increase in their support to the maximum rate of youth allowance - that is, members opposite would rip off some of the lower income families in this country. If they block this bill, a further 78,000 students who would have received a higher part payment will miss out on that higher part payment - ripping off 78,000 students. Even worse, 150,000 students around the nation will not get their student start-up scholarship of $2,254 - ripped out of their hands; 150,000 students having more than $2,000 each ripped out of their hands by the irresponsible conduct of the Liberal Party. Imagine going back to your own electorates at Christmas time and explaining that to your constituents: how you have cost students more than $2,000. And, if this legislation is blocked there will be no relocation scholarships for country kids who need to move - no legislative authority for them, no way of paying for them. Country kids around the country will miss out on their $4,000 relocation scholarship because of the actions of the Liberal Party and the National Party. That is what will happen if this legislation is defeated.Liberal and National parties members opposite need to think about this. I can see the penny dropping for the first time on the backbench about what this means. If they block this legislation, they will go back to their electorates at Christmas time having to explain a rip-off of 150,000 kids, having to explain a rip-off of relocation scholarships for country kids, having to explain to some of the lowest income households in this country why they are not getting the maximum rate of youth allowance, and having to explain to 78,000 more kids why they are not getting an increased rate. Think about it. You need to repudiate this stupid, irresponsible, inequitable strategy you are on now and pass this bill.</DOC>

 - The honourable member's question goes to the motivation of people smugglers and whether people smuggling is driven by domestic or international factors, or a combination of the above. That is essentially the essence of the honourable member's question. I say to the honourable member that the government's border protection policy, which is hard line on people smugglers and humane in its dealings with asylum seekers, is precisely the policy we took to the last election, it is the policy we have implemented since the last election and it is the one we will adhere to in the future.We are dealing with a range of push factors in Sri Lanka, which the foreign minister is acutely familiar with, having visited Sri Lanka I believe last week and spoken with the government about what is occurring there. What is occurring there is that we have something in the order of 260,000 displaced Tamils within the island because of the military actions and the civil war which occurred there earlier this year. What the foreign minister is seeking to do with the World Bank and others is to contribute to better humanitarian circumstances for those individual Tamils and their communities in Sri Lanka in a humanitarian fashion, to assist with their resettlement within the country. Secondly, on the operational push factors, I was recently in New Delhi and spoke with Prime Minister Singh about the 130,000 Tamils who have now gone from the island of Sri Lanka to India where they have temporary refuge. Thirdly, what the Indian Prime Minister and others have discussed with me is the fact that we have now had thousands upon thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils go to places like Germany, France, Canada and North America because we are dealing, as an international community, with a humanitarian crisis within Sri Lanka which has been occasioned by the civil war in that country.On the operation of our policy in particular, the honourable member - for example, I do not recall in his recent press conferences - has not referred to the numbers of Sri Lankans who have, thus far, been sent back to Sri Lanka through the operation of our normal immigration policy. Once they have been through processing and it has been determined that individuals are not compatible with the criteria laid down by the refugee convention, we have done as we have said in policy we would do, which is to dispatch individual Sri Lankans back to that country. Most recently - in fact, I believe only several days ago - two-thirds of a group of 50 Sri Lankans who arrived in this country in April were returned to Sri Lanka, given that it has been determined that they were not refugees. In fact, a group of six men who were involved in protest action while in detention were removed from Christmas Island on Saturday and arrived safely in Colombo that night. Thirty others from that same boat have now returned to Sri Lanka voluntarily after their claims for protection were thoroughly assessed. - We always welcome questions from the member for Murray but even more do we welcome her interventions at the dispatch box. I say to those opposite who ask questions about the operation of our policy that, (1), it deals with the push factors; (2), it also deals with transit countries; and, (3), we are dealing with how we operate a policy in sending people back to Sri Lanka and other countries, people who do not meet the criteria laid down under the refugees convention.Concerning our transit countries, can I also say this: our cooperation with the government of Malaysia - and I notice that this has not been the subject of any press commentary from those opposite because it is a further step forward - our cooperation with the government in Kuala Lumpur has resulted in the disruption of some 15 attempts of people smuggling involving roughly 550 people. We are very grateful for the cooperation of the government there.Over the weekend, I was informed by Prime Minister Najib of Malaysia that we would continue to expand our cooperation dealing with people smuggling. Furthermore, for the information of the House, the Prime Minister of Malaysia informed me that the Malaysian government has now decided, for the first time, to criminalise people smuggling in that country. This again is a reflection of the work which is underway between us and the Malaysian government, as indeed it is underway with the Indonesian government as well.Finally, when it goes to the actual success of government policy in interruptions, I say this: so far some 88 to 90 interruptions have occurred as a result of the direct cooperation between the Australian government, the Indonesian government, the Malaysian government and other governments within the region, interruptions which have involved some several thousands of individuals seeking to come to this country by the agency of people smugglers. We are dealing with one set of rolling operations after another, as you would normally do, as would any responsible government of Australia do. We are adhering to our obligations under international humanitarian law as laid down in the convention. We are maintaining a border protection policy with added resources and added investment in our maritime surveillance activities, at the same time working closely with our partners in the region. This is what governments have sought to do in the past and they will seek to do so in the future. It is what governments around the region are doing. It was also a challenge which confronted the previous government when they had some 250,000 boats come to this country carrying nearly 15,000 individuals. They were problems faced in the past, they are problems being faced now and they will be problems in the future. Our policy is a consistent policy; those opposite do not have a policy at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for her longstanding advocacy on the part of victims of asbestos. The struggle for proper compensation for victims of asbestos in Australia has been a long one. It is a struggle which was, of course, led by the late Bernie Banton and is being ably continued by his widow, Karen Banton. Following significant pressure being brought to bear on James Hardie, the New South Wales government secured an agreement with James Hardie in 2005 which required the company to provide funding for personal injury claimants who had been exposed to James Hardie products and asbestos in Australia.I take the opportunity of acknowledging the many, both inside and outside the House, who have been passionate on behalf of asbestos victims, particularly the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change in his former role as secretary of the ACTU. The 2005 agreement resulted in the creation of the Asbestos Injury Compensation Fund. This fund saw 607 claims on it in 2008-09 and 565 claims in the preceding year. Under the agreement, James Hardie has been obliged to contribute 35 per cent of their free cash flow each year.On 23 April this year, James Hardie advised the Australian Securities Exchange that it will not be in a position to make a contribution to the fund in the current year because of its very significant exposure to the depressed United States housing market. The advice to the Australian government from the fund was clear: projections were that the fund would be exhausted within two years. In fact, the fund was close to applying to the Supreme Court of New South Wales to move from providing full compensation payments to an instalment compensation payment system. Under these proposed arrangements, asbestos victims faced the very real prospect of not receiving their compensation payments before the end of their life. In our view, this was simply an unacceptable outcome.On 7 November, the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales announced an in-principle agreement for a loan facility to be made available to the fund that will cover three years of compensation payments at current claim rates. This joint agreement will mean that sufferers of asbestos related diseases will receive compensation payments in full, including their high upfront medical and carers costs. Under the joint agreement, the Australian government will provide a loan of up to $160 million to the New South Wales government that will go towards a loan facility of up to $320 million, to be made available to the fund for the purpose of meeting this shortfall. This decision will give hope and peace of mind to victims of asbestos and their families. The CEO of the Bernie Banton Foundation, Karen Banton, said:Asbestos disease sufferers across the country, I am sure, are very thankful that their fears are now allayed, that if they need to make a claim they are able to and they have some financial security for their family should they lose their battle.I want to make this very important point: this agreement in no way absolves James Hardie of their legal or moral obligation to victims of asbestos. The Australian government and the New South Wales government expect James Hardie will resume making substantial and regular contributions to the fund in coming years, in accordance with the terms of the agreement. However, this agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales does provide peace of mind to victims of asbestos and their families, and in our view they deserve nothing less.</DOC>

 - We know when logic has departed, hyperbole arrives. This is a question based upon the observations of a range of journalists for whom we may have individual respect, yet some corporate doubt, but I leave that for those in the gallery to contemplate. I simply say what I have said before: the good thing about our country is freedom of speech. Part of that freedom of speech is having a robust debate, including newspapers like the Australian. The editor of the Australian says he edits a right-wing newspaper. Good on him; he does, and it is part and parcel of the robust debate in this country. I welcome the contributions of all of those individuals. It is part and parcel of the vitality of Australia's democracy. And we may agree or we may disagree, but every organisation, every media outlet, including that whose editor describes it as a right-wing newspaper - or someone told me a centre-right-wing newspaper; I am told that makes a difference - should be entitled in our great democracy to have their say.The honourable gentleman's question goes to the arrangements pertaining to the individuals on this vessel. Again I would draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the letter of the secretary of the immigration department dated 16 November. The Leader of the Opposition does not like the contents of that letter because it simply refers to the approach which has been adopted in the case of this vessel and those who are on it as being consistent with general resettlement procedures. The special deal sought by those on this vessel was to be brought to Australia for processing. That is what has occurred; the special deal being sought by those on the vessel was to be brought to Australia for processing. From day one those on this vessel have demanded a special deal of being brought to Australia for processing and from day one the Australian government has refused and said they should be processed in Indonesia, and that is what will happen. Our policy is consistent on this.I say to those opposite: where is your policy? Where is it on border protection? Where is it even on how this individual should be processed? In fact, I have noted some interesting comments on that this morning from the good old shadow minister for immigration - but more of that in question time today.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. On climate change and action on renewable energy, the government is getting on with the job. Firstly, we passed the renewable energy target legislation, which those opposite did nothing about for 12 years. Secondly, we are in the process of seeking to obtain passage -  - I hear the interjections from those opposite. Where was the renewable energy target legislation introduced by the previous government up to 20 per cent or anything approaching that? I can't remember it. It took us to promise it to the Australian people, and us to legislate it. - The more the member for Flinders interjects, the more he doth protest and the more he doth protest too much. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is the second arm of our strategy and the third is our direct investment in renewable energy technologies.Today it was my privilege to be at the launch of Infigen's Capital Wind Farm at Bungendore. This will be the largest wind farm in New South Wales. It joins around 50 wind farms already in operation around the nation and it will boost the nation's wind power capacity by more than 10 per cent. Sixty-seven turbines on this particular wind farm are generating power capable of supplying some 60,000 homes. Capital Wind Farm has helped train the world's first wind energy apprentices in electrotechnology - wind, electricity, apprentices. I met three of them this morning and they have a fantastic opportunity at this particular project. But looking at this broadly, across the world, what we have is an explosion of renewable energy technology investment. In wind energy itself last year, and more broadly in renewable energy technologies, we saw US$120 billion invested. That was up from $63 billion just two years before. More than 80 countries around the world have now commenced wind farms and the industry around the world is now employing some 400,000 people. This sort of investment will be encouraged in the future by the renewable energy target legislation.On top of that, of course, we have the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. As I said to my good friend and colleague the member for Groom, we are engaged and continue to be engaged in good-faith negotiations with himself and with Leader of the Opposition in the House. What is occurring in the Senate does cause us some concern. We know that the Senate yesterday voted against sitting last night on this matter. They voted yesterday against bringing the matter on for debate. But I am informed today that the debate has commenced in the Senate or is about to commence. This is a good thing. But I am still concerned about what is actually happening in the overall ranks of the coalition and Liberal Party room.There were some reports yesterday that some 10 people opposite stood to their feet and opposed the course of action being embraced in these good-faith negotiations by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Groom. It was then put out, apparently, that those 10 party room dissenters did not represent a majority view and that more than that spoke in favour. Then again I see a report from one coalition MP instead claiming today in the AdelaideAdvertiser : 
'There were no speakers in favour other than Turnbull himself and Macfarlane,' _Who knows what the truth of all that is? There is an internal problem within the coalition on these matters, but I encourage the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Groom to continue in this debate. - We are dealing with a reality now in the Senate where the leader of the Liberal Party opposition in the Senate says as follows in response to a question yesterday, 17 November, from David Speers:David Speers: Isn't this a problem for the government? Even if they meet all your demands there is no certainty that you will vote for it?This is yesterday.Senator Minchin: No, that's correct. We said that at the outset. That's the risk the government took in bringing in this legislation.In other words, as of yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, which is where these matters are now being deliberated, says that even if we negotiate an outcome with the Leader of the Opposition and with their negotiator, the member for Groom, Senator Minchin may not cop this. Can I say to those opposite: we want to continue these good-faith negotiations with the Liberal Party and the National Party, but what we would actually like is for the Leader of the Opposition to assure us that these negotiations have substance. We have said that we are prepared to deal on agriculture. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is important that he provides an assurance to the parliament of the nation today that they will not block a vote on this in the Senate, that these are good-faith negotiations and that they will be brought to a conclusion, because the nation is demanding action on climate change, not further delay.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for the question. This country needs to act as part of a global effort to prevent the most severe impacts of climate change. In fact, the IPCC report predicts that, without action against climate change, global temperatures will increase by up to five or six degrees by the end of this century. In fact, the record shows that 13 of the last 14 years have been the warmest on record. We will be exposed to drought and we will be exposed to more intense and extreme weather events, including bushfires and heat waves, without taking action against climate change. Australia has already experienced an unusually hot second half of 2009. The Bureau of Meteorology reports that the mean temperature for the five months to November has averaged 1.38 degrees Celsius above the average from 1961 to 1990. So taking action against climate change is critical. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is the centrepiece of the government's efforts to bring down emissions. Disunity on display right now in the coalition is threatening action against taking on the threat of climate change.As I remarked yesterday, the opposition is split into two camps, and I want to acknowledge those on the opposite side who hold the view that we need to take action against climate change. But they are of course up against the sceptics led by Senator Minchin. Senator Bernardi seems to be a disciple in this respect and, emboldened by Senator Minchin, he has offered this contribution in the debate that took place on Four Corners, a debate amongst those who are members of the coalition. Senator Bernardi had this to say: 'The earth is not actually warming. We still have rainfall falling.' Thankfully it is not rising. 'We still have crops growing. We can go outside and not cook.' These comments not only are bizarre but are wrong. We have already seen warming of 0.9 degrees Celsius since 1950 in this country. South Australia, where Senator Bernardi is from, is the nation's driest state, and climate change will put at risk a large part of the state's $3.6 billion agricultural industry.He is not alone of course. The member for Barker goes so far as to seemingly welcome climate change. He had this to say in the second reading debate:I can assure you that in fact more people will die from global cooling because coldness causes more deaths than heat ever does and ever will.And this is despite the fact that there were in excess of 370 heat related deaths in Victoria in the heatwaves at the beginning of this year. But the sceptics group in the coalition simply will not attend to the evidence that is available. The member for Hume, to whom I referred yesterday also, had this to say in the CPRS second reading debate:Carbon dioxide, for the information of the House, feeds plants. It is a potent fertiliser -                 _            _            _In other words, there are people alive today thanks to extra carbon in the atmosphere.What the member for Hume is missing is that it is the rising concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that are contributing to global warming. The fact is that there is expected to be a 40 per cent increase in drought frequency by the year 2070 in New South Wales, for example, and over a doubling of heat related deaths in Sydney by 2020. Is this of no concern to those in that camp in the coalition?All of the members of the coalition opposite should support the negotiations between the government and the opposition and support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is extremely important for this country that the views of the sceptics not be allowed to block possible agreement with the government which would result in the passage of the CPRS. Climate change is a great and important challenge for this country, and the national interest will be best served by sensible and responsible action by all of us. Those of you in that camp of the sceptics, led by Senator Minchin and backed up by the member for O'Connor, the member for Tangney and others who spoke in the Liberal party room opposing negotiations with the government, opposing climate science, should look at the evidence, take responsibility and act in the national interest.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asks about the processes which apply to the individuals currently on board the vessel. Can I draw his attention first of all to the correspondence from the secretary of the department of immigration dated 16 November, which describes the non-extraordinary nature of the procedures which apply here. Secondly, can I draw the honourable member's attention to the further letter which was tabled on Monday, which is the message which was drafted by the minister-counsellor for immigration at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. These two documents were tabled in the House on Monday. One concerned the generic procedures which apply and the circumstances which go to the Indonesians and ourselves as far as this vessel is concerned and, secondly, to those things which have been provided to the vessel in Indonesia.Can I say to those opposite on the very important question of arrangements as they pertain to those on board this vessel that we had a particularly interesting contribution today from the shadow minister for immigration. We ask for some consistency in approach on the part of all those in this place. The shadow minister was asked today: 'So you think more people will be coming as a result of the government's refusal to allow the boats to come, as the refugees themselves wanted, to Christmas Island?' In other words, do you think they should have gone on to Christmas Island, Australia? So what did the shadow minister for immigration say in response to that question? She said, 'Absolutely.' In other words, her argument here is that if you therefore instead were to ensure that the boat went on to Australia - that is, to Christmas Island for processing - it would result in a better outcome in terms of, let us call it, a message through to people smugglers. I would suggest to the shadow minister for immigration that, if she is going to go out and make up lines on the way through, she should be concerned about the actual consistency of policy. Not only have those opposite sought to have no policy on border protection but they sought to have no policy on the management of this vessel until the shadow minister for immigration stood up today and said it would have been far better for this boat to in fact have been taken to Australia for processing. That is the logical inference from what she says, because she says, 'Absolutely' in response to the question: 'Should we have acceded to the requests of the refugees themselves?' If she has a different interpretation of that I wait for her clarification in the House, because that is the way it reads to us.We have a clear approach to this. I suggest that those opposite instead apply themselves to some consistency of policy, the likes of which we have not had in this entire debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. Given that we share most of the bay with our electorates in Melbourne, our waterfront communities are of course focused on the impact of climate change, but the impact of climate change goes well beyond those people who are living on our shores. It will impact significantly on our health system. This week I met with Dr Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the World Health Organisation. Dr Chan was here as a guest of the government. She advised that the health effects of climate change are one of the key World Health Organisation priorities for this region. That is not surprising, given that recent reports prepared for the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for the Department of Health and Ageing and for much other work prepared for my colleagues and others outline the likely health impacts of climate change globally and here in Australia. Some of this makes very sobering reading.Climate change poses various potential health risks in Australia which are, as I said, not going to be just limited to coastal communities. There is likely to be an increase in deaths and morbidity due to the more frequent and intense extreme weather events such as droughts, heat waves, floods and bushfires. Of course, older Australians will bear the brunt of these disasters. We will experience higher rates of infectious and vector-borne diseases -  -  - It should be of particular interest that the increase in rates of infectious and vector-borne diseases are most likely to be felt immediately in Queensland - something I thought the member for Dickson might be interested in. There are diseases such as Ross River virus and dengue fever, as well as food- and water-borne diseases due to changing weather conditions for vectors and hosts. The geographic ranges of some of these diseases are of course likely to change, putting new populations at risk. Water scarcity is predicted to become more common, reducing food availability, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables.The increased incidence of extreme natural disasters such as drought is something that I thought those opposite might have an interest in. They have of course made representations to the government about the impact of drought and the mental health concerns of many in our rural communities, and these sorts of issues are likely to increase if change effects spread across the country. Of course, there are stresses placed on communities and the health system caused by internal migration and social disruption as people move away from coastal areas that are inundated by sea level rises.These sorts of recommendations are public and on the record and simply add to the reasons for us to act against climate change. The government recognises that climate change poses serious consequences for the nation's health and the health system and that urgent action must be taken to tackle this issue. We are not alone. The Australian Medical Association and Doctors for the Environment Australia have both called for action against climate change and warned of the potential health risks - some of which I have just outlined - that climate change will bring. It is time to act. The government is doing that. We call on the Liberals to get on and act in the national interest.</DOC>

 - One never knows with the member for Murray whether it is going to be an attack from the right or the left - that is, whether we are being too harsh or too soft or the Indonesians are too hard or too soft - and you can do that if you do not have a policy, other than the reintroduction of temporary protection visas, which saw nearly 100 boats arrive after that with nearly 10,000 people.The honourable member's question goes to the accommodation of asylum seekers in this particular centre. I refer to the arrangements in place for the housing of individuals at the Tanjung Pinang detention centre. Could I say in response to the honourable member's question that I am advised that women and children will be housed in a separate facility adjacent to the Tanjung Pinang detention centre, and that is consistent with responses that we made to questions earlier in question time both this week and probably in previous weeks. Can I also note in that context that the Indonesian foreign minister has also said, 'We would want to ensure that the best interests of the child and other vulnerable groups and individuals are properly looked after.' Could I also refer to the fact that it has been the longstanding practice for Australian governments, past and present, to provide funds for international organisations, such as the IOM, for the refurbishment of detention facilities in Indonesia. So, as far as these individuals are concerned - women and children - of course there are separate and special arrangements being made. But I make the overall point that the accommodation arrangements for asylum seekers are ultimately the responsibility of the Indonesian government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Australia has perhaps more to lose than any other developed nation if we fail to combat and do our bit to reduce dangerous climate change. It is a sad thing to sit in this House day after day and listen to the climate change sceptics opposite denying the science, denying the reality and denying the consequences for our economy and for subsequent generations. They are in complete denial about all of the evidence, particularly when it comes to the importance of sending a price signal which will drive investment particularly in renewable energy, as the Prime Minister was saying before. They are in complete denial about the impacts on our environment, in complete denial about the impacts on our health and in complete denial about what it means for the wealth creation capacities of this economy and what it means for our subsequent prosperity.We in this House have become used to this, because those opposite are in denial a lot. This country would be in recession if they had their way right now. They were in denial about the global recession. It was not going to happen. Stimulus was not going to create a single job and now they say it has created too many - they like being on both sides of the argument from time to time. It is tragic that a responsible opposition that purports to be the alternative government of this country can be in such denial about the basic facts and science of climate change and, of course, completely in denial when it comes to the benefits that will flow through to renewable energy. The Prime Minister spoke about that before.We have a 2009 Climate Institute study that shows there is $31 billion worth of clean energy projects underway or planned in response to the government's climate change policies - $31 billion. But if the opposition had their way they would starve the future of vital job-creating investment. That is their proposition in this House - starve the future of vital job-creating investment in the renewable energy sector. This is a very serious question but over there, like they were at the beginning of this year, they have no comprehension about what this means for the economy. Then, as now, they would sit and they would wait and they would see. If they had had their way then, we would be in recession right now. They are the masters of misjudgement. They are consistently inconsistent when it comes to all of these questions. There is Treasury modelling on this. The opposition are in complete denial about the Treasury modelling and in complete denial about all of those issues.We on this side of the House will pursue the long-term national economic interests of this country. We on this side of the House are prepared to take the hard decisions those on that side of the House will not ever face up to. All they are interested in doing is playing short-term politics. We on this side of the House will put in place the policy settings for the long-term. We will make sure that we deal with dangerous climate change, that our economy becomes more efficient, that we invest in infrastructure for the future and that we put our budget on a sustainable footing, despite the vandalism in the Senate from those opposite when it comes to keeping budget measures. We on this side of the House are the party that is supporting jobs and we on this side of the House are the party of the future. They are the party of the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and I thank her for reading the department's annual report. Can I say that when it comes to the processing of individuals - be it in Indonesia, Australia or anywhere else in the world - two matters are relevant. One is whether they have already been processed by the UNHCR for the determination of their refugee status, and that can be a long or a shorter process depending on the complexity of the case; and, two, whether they have already been processed and, so determined, what length of time then ensues in terms of identifying a resettlement country. They are the two processes which apply. In the case of this particular vessel, you will have a mix of individuals, some of whom have already been processed by the UNHCR previously in Indonesia, others of whom have not. In all these circumstances, therefore, the individual processing time will vary depending upon the case. They are the two categories of case we are dealing with and we are doing so in conformity with government practices, as outlined in the letter by the secretary of the immigration department.Leave is not granted.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much to the member for Ballarat for her question. I know that she cares about the future of education in this country. - The member for O'Connor is obviously off on a different topic. He so frequently is. In the last 24 hours, what has happened in this House and in the Senate is as follows. The Liberal and National parties have voted to punch a more than $1 billion hole in the budget, despite the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer consistently saying that they are concerned about debt and deficit. They, of course, now must recognise that they have voted to punch a more than $1 billion hole in the budget.In the last 24 hours, members of the Liberal and National parties have voted to disadvantage country students. In the last 24 hours, members of the Liberal and National parties have voted to make life worse for small business and to tie them up in red tape. And perhaps the last one will not surprise people quite so much - in the last 24 hours, the Liberal and National parties have voted once again in favour of a return to Work Choices.On the first of those two, on the bill before the Senate about student financing, which came back to the House today, the Liberal and National parties in this House voted for changes to that bill that would cost more than $1 billion. There are no matching savings. The shadow minister will say that he did have some matching savings, but, of course, he never had matching savings in the order of more than $1 billion and we would not join with him in the gross inequity of permanently cutting scholarships for Australian students, including a rip-off of $162 million of scholarships out of the hands of country kids. And in this House this morning, members of the Liberal and National parties voted to disadvantage country students. They voted to disadvantage country students by voting effectively to rip out of their hands scholarship money. Why did they do this? They did it to put in place a transition issue for kids who live at home. - Obviously, the member for Murray, who is calling out about this, does not understand what she voted for. I will explain what she voted for. She voted for new transitional arrangements for kids who live at home. She voted for new transitional arrangements for kids who may well live in households of incomes over $300,000 a year. They may live in a city within walking distance of a university. She has voted for amendments for transitional arrangements for those kids to get full youth allowance - that is what she has done, justified in the name of country kids but nothing to do with country kids.Of course, by standing in the way of this legislation, what the Liberal and National parties are voting for is no scholarships next year, because the Liberal and National parties have already voted for the abolition of the current scholarship scheme. What they are now refusing to vote for is putting in place the new scholarship scheme. That is, they are voting for no scholarships for kids next year.Do members opposite realise what this will mean? In the electorate of the member for Sturt, 1,393 kids will miss out on scholarships if the coalition has its way. In the electorate of the member for Swan, 1,606 kids will miss out. In the electorate of the member for Herbert, 1,215 will miss out. In the electorate of the member for La Trobe, 751 kids will miss out. In the electorate of Wentworth, 1,121 kids will miss out. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The question that is before this parliament now is whether members of the Liberal and National parties will follow the foolish direction of the member for Sturt and engage in these rip-offs of kids in their electorates - that is the question. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition is a busy man and I understand that he has probably not taken personal carriage of this matter, but it is time for him to do so because he cannot, as Leader of the Opposition, defend a $1 billion black hole in the budget and he cannot defend ripping scholarship money out of the hands of 150,000 students around the country.At the same time, the Leader of the Opposition may want to direct his attentions to what the Liberal and National parties are doing to destroy the prospect in this country of a national workplace relations system, a reform that the former Prime Minister, John Howard, set as an ideal for a long period of time. Why? Because the former Prime Minister, John Howard, was right that a national system would be better for small business. But yesterday in this parliament the Liberal and National parties came in here to smash and destroy the prospects of a national workplace relations system, presumably because they want to see small business tied up in red tape.The Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal and National parties need to explain this conduct - a $1 billion black hole; country kids disadvantaged; small business tied up in red tape. It is time the Leader of the Opposition took personal carriage of these matters, or is the truth that the Leader of the Opposition already has personal carriage of these matters and, given his weakness and his struggle with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, he needs to find a few bones for the hard right of his party, like making sure they vote against a fair workplace relations system and vote to bring back the Work Choices rip-offs? Is that what it is all about? It may well be, but Australian small businesses and country students should not pay the price of the Liberal leader's weakness. The Leader of the Opposition should take personal charge of this and fix it. He will be judged by his actions over the coming few days.</DOC>

 - We had a question from the left before and I think we are back to a question from the right this time. Of course, there is one fundamental logical flaw in the question, and the fundamental logical flaw is this. - Ah! Coming in on cue: we have run out of public housing. I welcome the intervention. Who was it in the last 12 years who fundamentally defunded Australian government public housing in Australia? The coalition. Who was it who sat on their hands as the public housing queues in Australia went through the roof? The coalition. - And who opposed the stimulus strategy which seeks now to invest in 20,000 units or thereabouts of public housing? The coalition. And those opposite say we are underfunding public housing. - The question in part went to the availability of public housing stock in Australia and it was followed by an intelligently targeted interjection by an opposition backbencher about why there was an undersupply of public housing in Australia. I am responding to both elements, including the public housing element of the question asked by the member for Farrer.Of course, the logical flaw contained in the question is this. First of all, when it comes to any asylum seeker anywhere, there is the whole question of assessment and processing of the individual. Secondly, what happens once processing occurs is that if a person has been determined not to be a bona fide refugee in one part of the world or another they are sent back to the country from which they came. As I informed the House yesterday in terms of an arrival of a boatload of some 50 individuals back in April, two thirds of those were sent back to Sri Lanka in the course of the last week or so. That is normal process. Thirdly, in the case of the identification of those who do have bona fide refugee status, what then occurs when it comes to offshore processing in the case of Indonesia is that negotiations occur with resettlement countries, as has been the practice since time immemorial. Fourthly, consistent with the arrival of refugees in this country or any other country, the normal provision of social services applies. That is the law and that is how it has been for a long, long time.I go back to some fundamental principles in this debate. Those opposite have refused to take a policy on this throughout the entire debate. Their entire agenda has been to whip up fear and concern in the Australian community. They are being all fear and no solutions. Furthermore, here we are in this week of a critical debate on climate change, and not a single question on climate change. Not a single question on the economy. Not a single question on health or education. They are only interested in whipping up a fear campaign on the question of asylum seekers - the Liberal Party we have known for a long, long time.From day one, those on this boat sought to demand that they come to Australia for processing and from day one this government's resolve has been clear - that they should be processed in Indonesia. And that is what is happening.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. As members would of course appreciate, the danger posed by the spread of nuclear weapons is a grave threat to international peace and security. The human and environmental consequences of the use of these weapons again are too terrible to contemplate. The more states that acquire the capability to produce nuclear weapons then, regrettably, the more likely it is that one will be used. Addressing the challenge of nuclear non-proliferation is a key priority for the Australian government, as it is for the international community. Today, unfortunately, the non-proliferation regime is under pressure, including from the destabilising actions of Iran, whose failure to comply with its international obligations has undermined international norms.Members would recall that in 2002 Iran was exposed for constructing secret uranium enrichment facilities. Since that time Iran has been found to have been in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, and has refused to comply with four binding Security Council resolutions. The most recent IAEA report, which was on Monday this week, confirmed that Iran continued to ignore its international obligations. The concerns of the international community about Iran's nuclear intentions were underlined and reinforced by its revelation in September that it had been building another covert uranium enrichment facility near Qom. The IAEA inspected the Qom facility on 26 and 27 October. This initial inspection has raised further questions about the intended purpose of that facility and the timing of its construction. Iran's failure to declare the Qom facility to the IAEA was not only inconsistent with its obligations to the IAEA but also gives rise to questions as to whether there might be other undeclared such facilities.The latest report this week from the IAEA comes at a critical time for Iran. Iran has a historic opportunity for fundamental change in its dealings with the international community. The early October talks between Iran and the so-called P5 plus one - the permanent five plus Germany - were a very promising step welcomed by Australia and the international community. At the talks, Iran agreed to consider a proposal drafted by the IAEA under which Iran would transfer a significant proportion of its low-enriched uranium to Russia and France for fabrication into fuel for Iran's Tehran research reactor. This proposal represented a unique opportunity for Iran to reverse its course from confrontation to cooperation.President Obama noted in mid-November that he wanted, as did the international community, a positive response from Iran but that time was running out. Australia shares the view that Iran needs to respond not only in a positive manner to that proposal but also in a timely manner. The Australian government fully supports further dialogue between the P5 plus one and Iran on its nuclear program, but neither Australia nor the international community can wait indefinitely. Australia has fully implemented United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran and members will recall that in October last year I announced in the House the imposition of additional Australian autonomous sanctions.I conclude by reiterating that Iran's refusal to comply with legally binding United Nations Security Council resolutions is of serious and grave concern to Australia and the international community. Australia remains prepared to contemplate further action in this area. Iran is of course able to assert its right to a peaceful civil nuclear program. But it must carry out its non-proliferation responsibilities, it must carry out its non-proliferation obligations and it must conduct itself in conformity with United Nations Security Council resolutions.</DOC>

 - This comes from a party opposite which presided over nearly 250 boats arriving in Australia with nearly 15,000 people, and in the period that this government has been in office - about two years now - some 2,100 people have come to this country. And of course in all those circumstances what happens is a product of international security circumstances, most recently the war in Sri Lanka. What is remarkable about, shall I say, 'special deals' is the arrangements which those opposite had when it came to the Pacific solution. The hairy-chested statements: 'All to the Pacific solution; not to come to Australia,' and 60 per cent of those sent to the Pacific solution by the member for Berowra became permanent residents of Australia. Or, shall I say, the hairy-chestedness of: 'We're going to bring in temporary protection visas to show that we're really tough,' only for 90 per cent of those 10,000 people who were granted temporary protection visas to end up as permanent residents of Australia.What we have here is a fundamental gap between what they say, what they have done, and what they would do. Our policy is absolutely clear-cut. What we have said from the beginning is that these individuals on these vessels will not be processed in Australia. They will be processed in Indonesia, despite their demands. We have rejected those demands, and processed in Indonesia they will be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question. I know it is an issue of interest across the community and I am pleased to be able to advise the House that private health insurance participation levels continue to grow and more Australians are taking out private health insurance. The latest Private Health Insurance Administration Council statistics that cover membership and data about the private health insurance industry were released on Monday and they reveal that there are now 9.82 million people covered by hospital cover with private health insurance. This is the highest number of people covered by private health insurance since March 1983.The figures show that, since the election of the Rudd government, an extra 430,000 people now have private hospital cover and that coverage has increased half a percentage point, from 44.2 to 44.7. These figures demonstrate without question the strength and the resilience of the private health insurance sector, even during the financial crisis. This makes all the more ridiculous the claim made by the member for Dickson last year that changes to the Medicare levy surcharge would result in one million people leaving private health insurance funds. It was always a ridiculous claim, and the data makes it absolutely clear just how ridiculous it was.It also highlights again the hysterical claims made by those opposite following the reforms to the private health insurance rebate that were announced in the budget. This fortnight the government will reintroduce into the House the legislation that was rejected by the Senate in September. This legislation is about making government support for private health insurance fair and sustainable into the future. We know that if we do not make these changes the current rebate will double as a proportion of health expenditure by 2046. In fact, we know that costs are already escalating. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook released a fortnight ago showed an increase of $276 million in rebate expenses since the forecast just in the May budget. This equates to an extra $1.1 billion over four years.The changes that we have announced to the rebate, as many in the House would know, will provide a fairer distribution of benefits. I am sure one of the reasons the member for Fowler and those on this side of the House are interested is that it will mean that people who can afford to pay more for their health insurance should. We believe that private health insurance incentives should be being paid to support nurses, taxidrivers and secretaries to take out private health insurance, so that those who need the rebate to take out insurance will get it, not those like members of parliament or CEOs or millionaires who will take out their private health insurance irrespective of the rebate.Unfortunately, these sentiments about making the system fairer are not shared by the member for Dickson. The member for Dickson and the Leader of the Opposition have been extremely ideological about this fight, but the data released today show that those ideological battles are ones of the past. This is about making our health system sustainable; support for private health insurance sustainable; support for those who most need our assistance able to be continued into the future. Our reforms are going to help protect the strong balance between the public and private health sectors, and of course they will save $1.9 billion over the next four years.We believe in a quality health system for all Australians. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party only want a quality system for some Australians. But introducing this bill again into the House in the next fortnight will give the Liberal Party a second chance to rethink their support for a fairer system and better support for the taxidrivers, secretaries and nurses who need our assistance, instead of the CEOs, members of parliament and millionaires who do not need a private health insurance rebate.</DOC>

 or in the provision of services to the homeless - I think of the Brotherhood of St Lawrence and others which have been formally historically associated with religious organisations - they do a first-class job. The second point I make is that often the best form of delivery of social services on the ground is where you actually have government working in partnership with church and charitable organisations. - Now that there has been an interjection on another matter, I will come to that in due process, Mr Speaker. - Mr Speaker, it does deal with the question of the cooperation between the church and charitable sectors. I am quite happy to take the interjection, but I will respond to the honourable member's question first - that is, the excellent forms of partnership which exist between governments, state and federal, and many church and charitable organisations, whether it is in health, education or the broader delivery of social services. On the particular question which arises from the points that have been made by Senator Xenophon, the honourable member is right to say that whatever matters have been contained within that which contain any allegations of criminal misconduct are properly referred to the relevant authorities.On the broader question, can I simply inform the honourable member of what constitutes tax exempt status under the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Commissioner of Taxation has responsibility for administering the law relating to the endorsement of charities. For a religious institution to get access to a range of tax exemptions and concessions, it must be endorsed also by the Commissioner of Taxation. Parliament has placed the administration of Australia's tax laws with the Commissioner of Taxation and neither the Assistant Treasurer or the Treasurer nor any other minister may intervene in the proper exercise of these statutory powers. Furthermore, the Taxation Office is required to carry out regular reviews of endorsed organisations and their operations to ensure they continue to meet the requirements of that endorsement. The tax office publishes details of specific areas of focus for review on an annual basis. Once endorsed, religious institutions are income tax exempt. As religious institutions are also generally charitable institutions, they can also access GST concessions and fringe benefit tax concessions - not broad exemption but access to some specific exemptions. For a religion to be considered for charitable status, it must be an entity established for a public benefit that the law regards as charitable. The advancement of religion in one form or another has been part of a charity throughout the history of charity under that law. That is the legal framework within which we operate when it comes to the specific operations of the tax act and the specific operation of the Commissioner of Taxation.On the question specifically raised about Senator Xenophon from South Australia, as I said earlier today when asked about this, he has raised some serious matters - and I go beyond the allegations of criminality which were contained within his remarks - and we as a government will reflect upon those in terms of whether any further parliamentary action is appropriate. But we would like to proceed in a cautious and methodical way in examining those matters.Those opposite, in a related interjection, talked about the role of school chaplaincies. As I have said here before, school chaplaincies across Australia do a fantastic job. We are firmly of the view that they have provided an enormous contribution to the work of local school communities. I know it firsthand from my own electorate in Brisbane and I know it right across the country in a whole bunch of different cities and communities where they are stepping up to the plate and performing so many of the roles which school counsellors would normally perform, often in school communities where there are no school counsellors.Opposition members - Fund them. - Of course, different schools have different solutions and that is as it should be. I say to those opposite, though, who seek to interject in a partisan fashion that if this was -  -  - Those opposite have on this question. I do not think I am stretching the truth when I say that they have interjected in a partisan fashion. Were this to be such an enduring commitment on the part of those opposite, I would assume it would have been put permanently into the forward estimates beyond a simple three-year allocation, which is what occurred. I simply say to those opposite that, if the depth of their commitment was to be reflected in their forward planning and what they were going to put into place in the past, I would have thought it would have endured into the future as a permanent set of funding arrangements. Of course, let us never ask the question of consistency when it comes to those opposite on any matter of policy, whether it is asylum seekers, whether it is climate change, whether it is the stimulus strategy, whether it is borrowing to keep the economy afloat or whether it is any other policy.On school chaplaincies, we believe they are doing a fantastic job. The minister has said repeatedly that we will conclude our proper review of these services and, as I have said in this House before, I believe chaplaincies have a strong future in Australia. I have been personally associated with their operation in Queensland in the past, going back to the early 90s. I am proud of that association.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - I thank the honourable member for Makin for his question, which goes -  - Obviously they are going feral today, as usual, Mr Speaker! - I thank the honourable member for Makin for his question, because it goes to a very serious issue concerning our historical relationship with the traditional owners of the land in Australia. In that context, I am pleased to advise that on Monday of this week I signed, on behalf of the Australian government, the Maralinga hand-back agreement. This agreement, which I am sure is of major interest to all South Australians, represents an understanding between the Australian and South Australian governments and the Maralinga Tjarutja people, setting out the roles and responsibilities of the three parties following the formal hand-back of the former British nuclear test sites at Maralinga to their traditional owners. Following my signing of the agreement, the South Australian government introduced into the South Australian parliament amendments to the Maralinga Tjarutja Land Rights Act to give legislative effect to the agreement, and I am pleased to say that hopefully the process will be completed in December and it has the support of all major parties in the South Australian parliament.I think it is interesting to note that the hand-back of this land will complete the Australian government's actions in response to the 1985 Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia. I remind the House that, in response to the royal commission recommendations, the then Hawke government agreed to clean up the land and return it to the traditional owners. Successive Australian governments of all political persuasions have progressed this objective in full consultation with the South Australian government and the Maralinga Tjarutja community. Most of the 3,100 square kilometre site is available for unrestricted access. However, as a precautionary measure, permanent habitation is not permitted in an area of 412 square kilometres which is available and deemed safe for casual access.In terms of the agreement, I also indicate that it is not just about handing back the land. The Commonwealth is also engaged in proper discussions about a formal agreement with the Tjarutja community to assist that group in developing business opportunities presented by the return of the land, including potential tourism ventures. As Minister for Tourism I look forward to working with the minister for indigenous affairs to put in place long-term economic opportunities with the Tjarutja people. As I said, I believe that this agreement represents a practical example of reconciliation, hopefully bringing long-lasting economic opportunities to the Tjarutja people and, in doing so, not only giving them their traditional lands but also better employment and other opportunities in life.I also bring to the attention of the House the fact that, unfortunately, the hand-back occurred just over 12 months after the death of Archie Barton, who for 20 years led the Maralinga Tjarutja people in their campaign to both recover their lands and have them cleaned of the consequences of British atomic tests. I am sure I speak on behalf of all members of the House in welcoming the hand-back and wishing the Maralinga Tjarutja people well for the future. This is a major step forward in our engagement and reconciliation with the Indigenous communities of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson very much for his question. I am sure he will be needing a temporary protection visa once he returns to Dickson, for protection from his local constituents! He raises a question concerning health and hospitals; I welcome this question. I welcome it fundamentally, because the government, prior to the last election, said that we were sick and tired of the blame game between the federal government and the states because that was the game in which the previous federal government engaged day in, day out. If you want practical evidence of it, as the member for Dickson has obviously not provided in any element of his question, I say to him that $1 billion was extracted from the public health budget by the Howard government for the states. That flowed through to hospitals like Bundaberg Hospital. So what we had was this rolling debate between the Australian government and the state governments as to who was responsible for what. There was one clear response from the Howard government - of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member - which was simply to withdraw funding from the states, including from the public hospital system: $1 billion. - The honourable member opposite interjects, 'That is not true.' I suggest he consults the statistics. Secondly, therefore, they ask what we have done in response in terms of taking responsibility -  - He says he is not asking what we are doing in terms of taking responsibility. Well, his question was about the buck stopping with us -  -  
A government member - It's his birthday! - Mr Speaker, I am sure that his constituents are celebrating his return to his electorate. - The honourable member asked a question about taking responsibility for the system - the buck stopping with us. I am saying that in the period since the last election what we have done is increase hospital funding nationwide by 50 per cent - 50 per cent. You took $1 billion out; we have injected 50 per cent extra in. What does that translate to in dollar terms? Over the five years of the Australian healthcare agreement, signed by me and the minister for health at the end of last year, there was an increase in funding to $64 billion over five years in health and hospitals. That is some $20 billion more. That is what I call action. The honourable member for Dickson seems to regard that as inaction. Their action was to take $1 billion out; our action was to put $20 billion in over five years. I regard that as a pretty basic thing.Also on top of that, for the first time there was a $750 million investment in emergency departments, a $500 million investment for subacute care, $872 million in preventative care, and $600 million for elective surgery waiting lists. Also on top of the above, there was $1.1 billion for the health workforce. The honourable member asked about the health workforce, for example, because it is about taking responsibility. What did we inherit? We inherited a health workforce shortage affecting 60 per cent of Australians, a nursing shortage of 6,000 nurses nationwide, and GP training places capped at 600 per year since 2004. We inherited, as far as the Australian government was concerned, an entire catalogue of neglect. We have stepped up to the plate in the here and now, as reflected through the healthcare agreement signed by the minister at the end of last year and which is now operational. That is step 1.Step 2 is long-term reform. What the health minister and I have done since the election is engage in a series of consultations with hospitals based on the report of the independent commission, the health reform commission chaired by Dr Christine Bennett. Those opposite say, 'This is something extraordinary.' Let me hear them say what their reform plan was in their 12 years in office. Can anyone tell me what it was? I say to the member for Dickson: what was the health reform plan of the previous government? You had 12 years to have one. I just do not remember one. There was not a health reform plan - nothing to do with the hospitals, nothing to do with the totality of the health system, nothing to do with systemic health reform. They wanted to play the blame game.We said that we would commission an independent review. We did so. Christine Bennett concluded that, gave it to the government midyear, and we are now in the process of concluding consultations with about 80 public hospitals across Australia, right down the various centres along the Queensland coast, New South Wales and in every other state in the country. I think I have done nearly 20 of those myself, the health minister has done 40 or 50 herself, the assistant health minister and member for Lingiari has done the same, and of course so has our parliamentary secretary as well. Do you know why? We are road-testing the recommendations for long-term health reform with each of these hospital communities because we are determined to get this right. We believe health policy is important for the future because the health system is straining under the future demands imposed on it. Where we plan for the future, those opposite simply have a blame game for the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question and his continuing deep interest in the matters of trade. Last week I attended, along with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Treasurer, the APEC meetings in Singapore. This was the 20th anniversary of APEC. Bob Hawke was also there and that reminded everyone about the key role that Australia played in the formation of this organisation 20 years ago.I am asked about the key outcomes from the meetings. The first was the very strong commitment from the ministers present and the leaders in relation to the Doha Round, not only because of the importance of it as an economic stimulus, a stimulus that does not impact on the budget, but also about its importance in stemming returns or likely returns to protectionism.Another important outcome from the meeting was the decision and the announcement by President Obama to participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This represented a major contribution and commitment by the United States to trade liberalisation and it was a concrete demonstration of a strong ambition in this area. This augurs well for its commitment in relation to the Doha Round.It was also a major commitment to the Asia-Pacific region, and was welcomed as such. The commitment is to participate in the development of this partnership as a high-quality free trade agreement, a 21st century operation with all sectors - goods, services and investment - included. The involvement and commitment of the United States brought important critical mass to making sure that this announcement carried appropriate weight, and Australia is to host the first of four meetings of officials next year to advance this. Properly developed, this can be the bridge to a free trade area for the Asia-Pacific, so this was a very important breakthrough.Another important outcome was the commitment of those involved to decrease the costs of doing business in the Asia-Pacific region by 25 per cent by 2015. Obviously this is a very important commitment. It will add to the efficiencies and benefits of trade liberalisation in the region. An important study came out whilst we were there that showed that there was an APEC effect, that trade volume and participation were growing much faster in that region than the rest of the world.Finally, the agenda that was struck at APEC going forward was terribly important as well in terms of more strengthened economic integration within the region. Not only is it a focus of reform at the border, with tariff reductions, and reform behind the border - critical, given the services and investment dimension - but also reform across the border, with a focus on getting more efficiency in logistics movement in the area. It was a very significant meeting. The benefit of the organisation is well established and it was a pleasure to have participated in it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question and I acknowledge his long-standing interest in the concerns of veterans within his electorate. Service delivery for our veterans community is a very important aspect of what any government has to do. A key aspect of that is the issue of processing their claims in a timely manner, ensuring that they get the support that they are entitled to when they are entitled to it, and ensuring that it is all done above board in a careful, caring and considerate manner. These were concerns which were raised with us in opposition. Under the previous government the circumstances were that in a number of areas there were blowouts in the times taken for the consideration of claims across a number of different areas. Upon entering government we took action. We set up an interdepartmental working group which has worked to deal with the issues between departments, particularly improving information sharing between departments. Also, we reduced the number of medical reviews some veterans needed to undertake. There have also been improvements around proof of identity requirements needed in certain circumstances.We also established a special claims unit in December 2007 and it has worked hard within the department to work through those issues. The result of that has been a 20 per cent across-the-board improvement in the treatment of compensation claims, and a slight improvement for income support claims. In particular, under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, in 2006-07 the average time for a claim to be considered was about 188 days. In 2008-09, it is down to 143 days - an improvement in the region of 25 per cent. For Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act claims, in 2006-07 it was some 234 days. Now, in 2008-09, it is down to 151 - a 35 per cent reduction. The Veterans' Entitlement Act is the largest area and historically deals with most of our claims. In 2006-07 the average time was 89 days; in 2008-09 it is down to 69 days - a 20 per cent plus reduction. All of this is good news for those who we care for within the veterans' community; all of this is an important step towards improving the service provided.The member for Maranoa recently raised some questions in the House which related to some of these matters, and I will be writing to him in the next few days with respect to those. I can tell him that his constituent only lodged his claim in the last couple of days. What I can also say though is some of the issues that were raised around the question of proof of identity requirements were, I think, going to the issue much further than they should have been in respect of what the real impacts were. The bottom line is the standard approach operates within government, across government and in DVA it has been that way since 2004 - that is, under the previous government yet again.The circumstances are that we have to be careful because we do find instances of fraud, and I mentioned this in my answer recently with respect to this particular question. And I can also inform the House that over the past five years we have had some 20 cases of ID fraud which have been investigated and which, in fact, could have led to a situation of some hundreds of thousands of dollars being defrauded from the Commonwealth. There have been real improvements made here, real steps forward taken to ensure that we look after those who we care for within the veterans' community, all things which we can be justifiably proud of in government.</DOC>

 - The border protection committee of the cabinet considers the operational application of standard policy of the government on border protection. Our approach is very clear when it comes to dealing with people smugglers. It is a hardline approach, and that is one which has already seen the incarceration of people smugglers, it has seen the prosecution of people smugglers, it has seen also those which are currently before the courts, and we have had a large number of those indeed. Also, our approach is consistent in terms of being responsible in dealing with genuine asylum seekers, as is our policy in sending back home those who do not qualify as genuine refugees. That is our approach, and that is the policy which has been applied by the border protection committee in its dealings with this matter. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, because the question directly went to the operations of the border protection committee of the cabinet and its implementation of government policy and the application of that policy to individual circumstances. What I sought to explain to the Leader of the Opposition and to the Manager of Opposition Business, had he been interested in the substance of it and not in the politics of it, was precisely how that policy of the government applied to people smugglers, how it applied to genuine refugees, how it applied to those who had not obtained refugee status and were sent back home. That is our approach. That is our policy.What we have said from day one is that the Australian government would not succumb to any demands that these individuals on this vessel be processed in Australia, despite the recommendations of a number of those on the Liberal side of politics. Instead, what we did from day one was to say that these individuals on this vessel would be processed in Indonesia. That is precisely what has occurred, and that is the application and implementation of the government's policy as it relates to this individual vessel. That is our approach. That is our policy.What are the alternatives? The alternatives are: firstly, political opportunism; secondly, a policy-free zone; and, thirdly, a fear campaign. Also, a policy record which saw nearly 250 boats arrive in this country carrying nearly 15,000 people, 90 per cent of those issued with temporary protection visas by the previous government having ended up in Australia, 60 per cent of those who were sent on the 'Pacific solutions' having come to Australia also as permanent residents and, on top of that, the sorry record of children behind razor wire.Our approach is clear. We have implemented our policy. Those opposite do not have a policy. They simply are engaging in the politics of fear for the reasons they know too well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is interesting that he raises a question on climate change because, in the midst of the debate on climate change in the parliament, I am advised it is some 30 days since we have had any questions in this parliament from those opposite on climate change. I am told it is considerably longer since we have had a question on the economy. And I am told it is in fact many, many days indeed since we have had a question on education and whole other areas of concern to working families everywhere.The question goes to the current weather circumstances in Australia. I would say to those opposite, particularly the climate change deniers and sceptics opposite, that, as one of the hottest and driest inhabited continents on earth, Australia's environment and economy will be one of the hardest and fastest hit by climate change if we do not act now, act globally and act nationally. At its very core, climate change is about rising global temperatures. - Fact 1: globally, 13 of the 14 warmest years on record occurred between 1995 and 2008. - I assume from the interjecting member from Western Australia that it is simply a coincidence that 13 of the 14 warmest years on record occurred between 1995 and 2008. Fact No. 2 is that Australia has experienced warmer than average annual temperatures for 17 of the last 19 years. Again, that would just be an unhappy coincidence on the part of those who interject from opposition benches. Third, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, for the first two weeks of November much of south-east Australia has experienced daytime temperatures more than six degrees centigrade above average, with temperatures peaking in the range 39 to 45 degrees across most inland areas.I draw the House's attention also, importantly, to what the Bureau of Meteorology is saying about the week right now. The Bureau of Meteorology weather forecast indicates for the week 16 to 20 November we are likely to see these conditions continue with temperatures in the range of 40 to 45 degrees becoming widespread. - He intervenes, 'Not in Perth,' as if an extreme weather event in Victoria is irrelevant or an extreme weather event in South Australia is irrelevant. I would remind the member from Western Australia, whatever his electorate might be, that this is the national parliament. We have national obligations. He might not think we have a responsibility to nationally act on climate change, but he exists on a different planet with a shade cloth happily extended above it. This is what the data says. Furthermore, can I draw the House's attention to this: Melbourne, last night, recorded its highest temperature for a November night since records ever began, and that outstripped the previous record set in 1901 by almost two degrees. It is 43 degrees in Adelaide today and, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, Adelaide has experienced the first spring heatwave ever since its records began in 1887. I presume that the interjecting members over there, the climate change sceptics up the back and the absolute deniers in the centre over there, would say all of these are merely unhappy coincidences. There is a string of unhappy coincidences in the data and you can either choose to embrace what the science says or simply deny what it says and therefore take no action. The Bureau of Meteorology said last night 'the fire danger levels were into the severe range for a number of hours'. That was Mr Philip King of the Bureau of Meteorology. In these conditions I would encourage all Australians to listen carefully to what the fire authorities have to say.Let us go also to what the science has said through documents, including by the CSIRO, in the period when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister responsible for the environment. The CSIRO Climate change in Australia: technical report 2007 - not ancient history, not even mediaeval history but quite modern history; in fact, only a couple of years ago when he opposite was in fact the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources - says:Projections for Australia include increases in the frequency of heatwaves; increases in the frequency and length of drought conditions _ and a substantial increase in fire-weather risk in south-eastern Australia. - I am constantly stunned. It is as if we are back into the trial of Galileo or something and they are simply arguing somehow that the science is fiction and that they alone, in their own prejudiced universe, occupy fact. We are back almost in a mediaeval court when it comes to the mediaeval approaches adopted by those opposite. No wonder the Leader of the Opposition has such a hard time. If you have got to put up with that, mate, I have sympathy for you, I really do. -  - This is from the CSIRO when you were the environment minister:Projections for Australia include increases in the frequency of heatwaves _ the frequency and length of drought conditions _And further it says:_ and a substantial increase in the fire-weather risk in south-eastern Australia.The CSIRO also forecasts that over the next 20 years there will be up to 20 per cent more drought months over most of Australia and, by 2070, up to 40 per cent more drought months are projected in eastern Australia and up to 80 per cent more in south-western Australia. That is what the CSIRO said in 2007, the CSIRO reporting when the Leader of the Opposition was in fact the environment minister. Those opposite I would strongly challenge to actually embrace what the science says and the responsibility -  885 
Turnbull, Malcolm, MPMr Turnbull - Mr Speaker, a point of order: on the question of the Prime Minister's gestures, offensive gestures are not allowed. -  - Of course we are deeply concerned about the sensitivities of those opposite on climate change. But there is hope: our good friend and colleague the member for Groom, representing the constructive end of the Liberal Party argument on this - and we appreciate his efforts in negotiating this with us. But we have had comments both from the member for Groom today and from the other end of the spectrum, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, representing the destructive end of the debate. But both their comments are interesting. The member for Groom had this to say on ABC this morning:I accept that he - referring to the Prime Minister - has got a mandate to introduce the scheme. There are plenty who do not, but I do.I thank the member for Groom for recognising that fact. Furthermore:_ by the time the Senate rises by the end of next week he will have what he is demanding _He goes on to say:_ but it will be on our terms.That is fine; that is his political overlay. I do welcome what the member for Groom has said. I welcome his statement that, by the end of next week, we will have a successful vote on the CPRS - in the next five sitting days. That is a good outcome. A vote one way or the other is an appropriate reflection of a good faith negotiation with the government.The second comment is interesting as well. It is from Senator Minchin and it is directly relevant to this debate. On the question of the upcoming vote he says:Our party room, our joint coalition party room, will make a decision on how we will treat this bill next during the course of next week after Mr Macfarlane reports to us on his negotiations with the government. We then as a party room will decide which option we will elect to take.He goes on:But we will have a clear position at some stage during the course of next week as to what our view on this bill will be.What we have therefore is clarity from both ends of the debate, the climate change sceptic end of the debate and those within the coalition who actually want to bring about an outcome. So we have now the optimists in the spectrum, led by the member for Groom, backing a vote, and we have the pessimists, led by Senator Minchin, backing a vote. The only person silent so far on whether we should have a vote by the end of next week is the Leader of the Opposition. Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that if these are good-faith negotiations and it is the attitude that we bring to bear, stand up today and confirm that there will be a vote on climate change, on the CPRS, by the time the Senate rises next Thursday. We have it from the member for Groom, we have it from Senator Minchin, and we are all ears in terms of what the Leader of the Opposition will say. Five sitting days left until a vote: are we going to have a vote in the national interest or in some internal party interest? Five days in which to vote on the science, or five days in which to ignore the science and pursue prejudice. Five days left for action, or five days for inaction. Five sitting days left to vote for the future instead of simply lying in the path. We are engaged in good-faith negotiations with those opposite. I invite the opposition in question time today to confirm to the Australian people that there will be a vote on the CPRS legislation by the time the parliament rises at the end of next week. The nation and our global interests demand it.</DOC>

 - Once again I welcome all questions from the member for Murray, particularly given her confused position yesterday on whether the Liberal Party supports the boat having gone to Australia or to Indonesia. Our approach was that it should be processed in Indonesia. Her reading yesterday of her quotation was that her preference on balance was that it should be processed -  - I again thank the honourable member for Murray for her question and I was simply drawing the House's attention to the fact that yesterday a reasonable interpretation of her remarks was that the position of the Liberal Party was that this vessel should have been processed in Australia rather than Indonesia. That is the reverse position of the government. The agreement we have reached with the Indonesian government, given the circumstances where this boat was identified, in the Indonesian search and rescue area, and it having been permitted to then land at an Indonesian port, was that it should therefore be processed in Indonesia. That is our approach, in contrast to yours - absolutely clear. As for the immigration minister's statements today, I have not seen them. I fully support the public and private comments of the immigration minister, including his remarks today on how this matter has been handled.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt, who is a very close colleague and a very popular member in Leichhardt too. Australia has already experienced warming, with an increase recorded in the number of days which have been hotter than 40 degrees Celsius. November this year has seen a long and intense heatwave across much of southern and eastern Australia. New daily maximum temperature records for November have already been set at Wilcannia, at 45.2 degrees, and Broken Hill, at 43.4 degrees, on 16 November. Last night in Melbourne the temperature was 28.1 degrees Celsius, which was a new record highest temperature for a November night. Today temperatures in much of south-eastern Australia will be very hot, predicted around 45 degrees, with strong winds in some areas. This has resulted, as the Prime Minister has pointed to earlier, in the highest fire danger alerts being issued in some areas of the country.Whilst of course we are cautious about interpreting specific daily weather events like these, the trend is absolutely clear: our climate is warming. But of course there is continued disunity among the coalition - there are two camps, as I have adverted to on a number of occasions. It should be recognised that a number of Liberal senators, now that the debate on the CPRS has commenced in the Senate, were yesterday supporting the position of the Leader of the Opposition in the good faith negotiations with the government. One of those senators, Senator Boyce, supports an amended CPRS ahead of Copenhagen and said:I would like to see the package of bills passed and there is no reason why we cannot pass them ahead of _ Copenhagen_A sound observation from Senator Boyce. But of course the rival Liberal camp of sceptics has been well and truly unleashed in the Senate. Senator Minchin, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, only today said:The Senate overwhelmingly rejected the abomination in August; it should do so again.This is the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Liberal Party, in the Senate, saying the CPRS is an abomination and it should be voted down again. We understand that there were no fewer than 17 senators sitting in close proximity to Senator Minchin giving him plenty of verbal support. We have their names and I am happy to provide them. -  - I have seen the member for Groom walking around the floor with the black book he mentioned on Four Corners. I am very happy to provide the names of the senators. One thing I can say is that amongst them was Senator Bernardi, known now as Senator Minchin's foot soldier, who continued his rant against the science saying:One could describe it as the Sara lee cheesecake effect: layer upon layer upon layer of alarmism and deceit giving rise to the new religion of climate change.So we have communist conspiracies, we have neo-Nazi science and we have religions of climate change based on deceit - quite bizarre and absurd commentary continues to come. Senator Abetz is still maintaining that weeds - lantana, paterson's curse, you roll it up - are a greater problem than climate change. That is Senator Abetz. Senator Cash reconfirmed that she does not support action. She put a concise argument under any circumstances. She said:Under no circumstances should the CPRS be supported - under no circumstances.It is little wonder that there is profound, obvious division in the coalition. Senator Cash is unmoved by the fact that average rainfall decline of 10 to 20 per cent since the 1960s has caused a 50 per cent decline in dam inflows in south-western Australia. One would expect that she might have some concern about that. Another confirmed sceptic from WA, the member for Tangney - a denier, it is suggested to me - told the AAP today that more than a third of the Liberal Party would probably cross the floor to vote no, even if the government agrees to the coalition's amendments. With just five days left to vote on the CPRS, all of those opposite should be acting to limit the impact of climate change on Australia, cut out the nonsense, stop the delays and vote for the CPRS.</DOC>

 - I welcome that question again from the member for Curtin. I think today we are coming sort of from the left and maybe a bit from the right as well. On the question about processing times for those in Indonesia, first of all by way of context I say to the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that she may be unaware of the fact that in times past - including when the good old member for Berowra up there was in the chair - there was of course quite considerable processing of Indonesian-based refugees by Australia. There was quite a lot of it - several hundred in fact; 400, 500 or thereabouts - and quite a number by other countries. Guess what? The individual circumstances concerning each of those individual processing arrangements differed according to the circumstances.What are the sets of conditions which pertain here? First, whether a person has already been through UNHCR processing, which of course means that the a lot of the early work has been done; second, if they have not then of course there are a whole lot of primary documents to be checked; and third, if it is established that they are not bona fide refugees then they are sent back home. These are the three categories which we are dealing with here, as were those opposite when they were in office dealing with the 400 to 500 that were settled in earlier years under the UNHCR Australia reprocessing arrangements from detention centres in Indonesia. Each of these varies according to the circumstances. That is the approach we have applied here. A similar approach has been applied in the past and we will deal with all challenges as they present themselves to us in the future as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. In the current negotiations that the government is pursuing with the opposition with respect to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, we have two broad objectives. They are maintaining the environmental integrity of the scheme and maintaining its fiscal sustainability. The government is, of course, committed to returning the budget to surplus as quickly as possible and it is important that if we reach agreement it does as little damage as possible to the overall position of the budget, both in the short and in the longer term. I remind the House that the people we are seeking to negotiate with are the same people who have been seeking to tell the Australian people for months that the projected deficits in the budget are too high and that the projected debt as a result of that is too high. So I hope they take that on board in the negotiation process.But, unfortunately, the process of negotiation has been somewhat complicated by the people behind the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Groom who do not quite have the same perspective on these issues as they appear to have. We have some leading figures in the Liberal Party suggesting that this is all some kind of communist conspiracy and others suggesting that it is about a Nazi approach to science. We have the member for Tangney offering some kind of intergalactic conspiracy involving various planets and things of that kind. In spite of that, the government is seeking to negotiate in good faith, and we accept that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Groom are seeking to negotiate in good faith, but unfortunately they are being held hostage by the wackier outer limits of their own party. To illustrate just how ludicrous the statements were by Senator Minchin last week, just contemplate these facts. He is suggesting that there is some kind of global world government left-wing conspiracy to deindustrialise the world, some kind of communist conspiracy, that apparently his own leader is party to and his former leader John Howard is party to, and one of the very first international leaders to draw attention to the seriousness of the climate change challenge was none other than Margaret Thatcher - the great icon of the conservative movement all around the world, to which Senator Minchin adheres.This is sure some communist conspiracy. This is a real ripper of a communist conspiracy. It is so devious, it is so subtle and it is so pervasive that it includes the Leader of the Opposition, it includes John Howard and it includes Margaret Thatcher. Senator Minchin is incubating a kind of rural militia from backwards Montana in the Senate. He is out there in his fatigues. He has the bandana wrapped around his head. He has the gun-racks, he has the pick-up truck and he has the stock of beer there, and he is off chasing all those global conspiracies. The big problem here, unfortunately, is that he is holding the rest of Australia hostage in this process. He is holding the rest of the country hostage.I am asked about the budget implications of these issues. We can work out with reasonable accuracy the budget implications of proposed changes to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, but there is another aspect of this that I would like to draw to the House's attention. The government is looking at budget matters with a long-term horizon because of the impact of the global financial crisis. We have 10-year projections in the budget papers and, indeed, projections going slightly beyond that. So that is a 10- to 12-year period. As well as asking the question, 'What impact might these negotiations have on the budget?' which is a legitimate question that we are very concerned about, we are also interested in the question of what happens if Senator Minchin, the member for O'Connor, the member for Tangney and all the other wacky crew get their way? What happens if there is no action on climate change in Australia and no action on climate change globally? -  - The point I am making is that there is a serious price to pay for inaction on climate change - not just a price for the nation but specifically a price for the budget. If we see a collapse in tourism in the future in Far North Queensland because of the Barrier Reef, if we see Australian agriculture shrinking dramatically as a result of climate change and if we see the costs of dealing with amelioration and remediation on Australia's coastline rising because of climate change, all of those things will inevitably impact on the budget in the medium to longer term. There will be the need for adjustment packages. There will be higher unemployment. There will be the need for specific compensation to assist people who are affected. So I would urge the House, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Groom and those people in the Liberal Party who still have at least one foot on planet earth, to think very carefully about the implications of being held hostage by the urban and rural militias in the Senate that Senator Minchin is incubating because the implications of that for Australia, for the budget and for the people in rural and regional Australia in the longer term will be very serious.</DOC>

 - I think we have lurched to the right again on that question. I think I might have picked up the subtle subtheme as I heard those opposite and observed some of those opposite burying their heads as that question was asked. The honourable member's question goes to the assumption concerning the processing outcomes of individual asylum seekers. Therefore I say to the honourable member that, when it comes to the processing of this group of individuals on this particular vessel, some will be determined to be of refugee status, depending on where they have got up to in the overall process, and some will be determined not to be, depending on what evidence presents itself. Those who are not determined to be refugees will be sent back to their country of origin and those who are determined to be refugees will be subject to the resettlement processes which apply across the 16 to 21 resettlement countries. That is the first point.The second point goes to what provisions apply in terms of any asylum seeker who is granted asylum in Australia. I draw the honourable member's attention to the following: under the Howard government in 2007 more than 33,000 people who had held a refugee and humanitarian visa received income support payments. That was in 2007. Secondly, more than 2,200 baby bonus payments were made to those holding refugee and humanitarian visas. I just draw that to the honourable member's attention as well. Furthermore, under the Howard government, asylum seekers holding TPVs - that great and successful instrument of public policy - were able to access a special benefit paid at the same rate and with exactly the same means and eligibility test as the following: unemployment benefits, family tax benefit, the baby bonus, childcare benefit, the maternity immunisation allowance, double orphan pension and rent assistance. In 2002 there were nearly 5,000 temporary protection visa holders in Australia receiving income support payments. Furthermore, temporary protection visa holders were provided with all other normal provisions which applied under Australian law at the time. Under this government, refugees are provided the same range of services as has generally been applied in the past. When the honourable member asks a question of this nature, I suggest that she should reflect carefully on the arrangements, which I thought had prevailed on a bipartisan basis in this country for some time, rather than engage in the politics in which she is engaging.I also draw this to the honourable member's attention. Here we are on this sitting day, one week before the end of the parliamentary sitting, and it is now some 30 days since we have had a question on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is 97 days since we had a question on jobs. It is 29 days since we had any question on the economy, 22 days since we had a question on infrastructure, 22 days since we had any question on education, 23 days since we have any question on nation building. That is a lot of days, and I always think it is great that those opposite are keenly concerned about the interests of Australian working families. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. Mr Speaker, it was my pleasure earlier today to 'try a trade' in front of Parliament House with my colleagues Minister Wong, Minister Arbib, Minister Combet and Parliamentary Secretary Jason Clare. Now, I will let the parliament in on something that probably would be fairly obvious: we were not particularly good. In particular, I was not very good at the bricklaying that I was asked to do.I thank WorldSkills Australia for bringing 'Try a Trade' to Parliament House. Try a Trade is a program to interest young people in apprenticeships to make sure that they get the skills they need for the future. Through WorldSkills Australia our young people compete internationally, showing their trade skills to the world. Last time we did that as a nation we ranked fifth in the world, which was a tremendous achievement, and many of those young people came back from showing their skills to the world with gold medals, silver medals and bronze medals.As we were trying a trade today we had a discussion that we have had on many occasions with those who work in training, and that is they are already embracing the future. They are already training young Australians for jobs in a low-carbon economy. Of course, some of those jobs are jobs that we find it hard to imagine today, jobs that will evolve in a low-carbon economy. But many of the things we need to do to train Australians for a low-carbon future are in the very traditional trades - in plumbing, in electrical trades, in the way in which we design and construct buildings -  - and we are already moving to embrace this future. The government has already moved to ensure that 50,000 Australians get an opportunity in green jobs and green training opportunities and we have moved to provide $200 million through our teaching and learning capital fund to enable our vocational education and training system to get ready for training in areas like green plumbing, EcoSmart electricians, efficient heating, ventilation and air conditioning and the work that will need to be done on hybrid cars. I am pleased to be able to announce at the forthcoming COAG meeting that right around the nation there will be agreement on a new National Green Skills Agreement, which is about making sure that our training system is ready for the jobs of the future and that even the most traditional trades have their training arrangements updated for new green skills.As the nation moves forward and embraces the future, getting ready for the green economy of the future, of course we find the Liberal and National parties stuck in the past - in climate change denial, scepticism and inaction. They are stuck in the past, they are divided and they are unable to imagine how they can get to this new green future. Of course, the answer is obvious: get out of the way and support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and work with those Australians who are readying themselves for the future. The opposition, including the member for O'Connor, stay firmly in the past where the dinosaurs are. They still think that is appropriate. Australians are marching past them in their embrace of the future. It is time that they got out of the way and passed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first thing I would say in response to his question - and to one asked question earlier today - is that he cites as his authority (a) today the statements from individual asylum seekers and (b) in question time, I think, a week or two ago the statements of people smugglers themselves as underpinning the veracity of the question. I would simply draw that to the House's attention. The honourable member cites as his authority these untested statements of an individual asylum seeker and the untested statements of people smugglers themselves. That is the first point I would make. The second point I would make is that, as the honourable member would be fully aware, the resettlement arrangements for asylum seekers in Indonesia are coordinated by the UNHCR, and they do so in cooperation with resettlement countries right across the world, of which there are some 16 to 21, and with some additional voluntary arrangements as well. Thirdly, as I said in the House earlier today, it is entirely consistent with the 400 or so who were granted permanent residency in Australia by the previous government from detention centres in Indonesia as well, and that will be the case, obviously, as we work our way through resettlement procedures with other resettlement countries. That is normal.Finally, in terms of the boat that he refers to at Merak, I would simply draw the honourable member's attention to this: first of all, when it comes to those who came into the custody of the Australian vessel, that was in the Indonesia search and rescue area; secondly, the call went out from the Indonesians for assistance because they had no vessel in place; thirdly, we then answered that call, as I assume those opposite would ask us to do in response to any call for assistance under international maritime law; fourthly, with the consent of the Indonesian authorities, that vessel was then brought to shore; and, fifthly, we are therefore processing, in Indonesia, those on board, as you would expect. As for the vessel at Merak, the honourable member would also be familiar with the fact that this vessel was interdicted in Indonesian waters by the Indonesian navy and therefore the circumstances surrounding its interdiction and the particular responsibilities of Indonesia associated with it are of a different type.I say to the honourable member also that I still find it passing strange that here we are in the country's parliament and it is getting on for 100 days since we have had a question on jobs and nearly 30 days since we have had a question on the economy. I think it is time they gave Joe a go! He is back from paternity leave - congratulations on the birth of a new addition to the family. We want Joe to have a go! The Treasurer is getting lonely up here; we would like some questions on the economy. And we would also like those opposite to reflect upon the range of priorities which affect the interests of working families across the country, not all of whom are necessarily subject to the campaign of fear being conducted by those opposite on this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am advised that at approximately 6.30 pm on Saturday, Christmas Island time, a disturbance took place among a group of detainees at the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre. The disturbance was brought under control within about 30 minutes, with the assistance of the Australian Federal Police. I am further advised that, following containment of the incident, the centre is calm and all the detainees have been briefed by departmental officers. Departmental officials are currently investigating the circumstances of the disturbance. The Australian Federal Police is also conducting an investigation. If a detainee on Christmas Island has committed a serious offence, this will be taken into consideration as part of the assessment as to whether or not they are granted a visa. There were a number of injuries sustained, with 43 individuals receiving medical treatment. I am advised that five of the detention provider staff sustained minor injuries.On the matter of mandatory detention on Christmas Island, the opposition and the House will be aware that the government's policy on mandatory detention and offshore processing has been constant since the government was elected to office. That will continue to be our policy into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, as I am sure all members and those listening to the debate today are concerned about the future of action on climate change. This week in the Australian parliament we are down to the business end of deciding what our future national action will be on climate change. For the parliament there can no longer be any delay.Let us face the basic environmental and economic fact that we are the hottest and driest continent on earth - or one of them - and that the impacts will be felt here first and hardest of all continents on earth. Therefore, it is in our national interest that we act locally on climate change. It is in our national interest that we also act globally on climate change. It is in the planet's interest that we do so as well. The alternative is simply unsustainable. To ignore the science also means to fail in our fiduciary duties as a nation and fail in our fiduciary duties as international leaders towards the international community and its future. It is simply unsustainable for us to turn and look our kids and grandkids in the eye and say, 'We didn't step up to the plate when we had a historic opportunity to do so.'The time to act globally on climate change has come. Let us put all this into some context. It is now more than 30 years since the first World Climate Conference was called and governments were called on to act to guard against the consequences of dangerous climate change. It is 20 years since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was formed and produced its first report. It is 17 years since the international community acknowledged the importance of tackling climate change at the Rio Earth Summit and created the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That is where the global consensus has been emerging over the last 20 to 30 years.It has also been a long time since we first began the debate here about implementing an emissions trading scheme within Australia. Again, putting this into its general context, around the world a very large number of countries have brought in emissions trading schemes. Twenty-eight countries are already operating emissions trading schemes. There are six major economies moving towards emissions trading schemes and some 27 states in Canada and the United States are also moving towards emissions trading schemes. Here in Australia, former Senator Hill, the former Minister for the Environment, said in July this year:Well, I started work on a potential cap and trade for Australia almost a decade ago; the political time wasn't right then. Perhaps it's getting closer _ But basically, as with most Western nations, I think a cap and trade is the way to go.If you look at the rest of the action that has been undertaken since then, again, it puts into historical context that the time to act on this has come and the time for further delay has, frankly, well and truly gone. In 1999 the Australian Greenhouse Office released six discussion papers on climate change and emissions trading. In 2000 and 2002 two further discussion papers were released on how we could bring about an emissions trading scheme. In 2007, the then secretary of the Prime Minister's department, Dr Shergold, provided the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading's Shergold report. And, of course, at the last election, the previous government also committed itself to introducing an emissions trading scheme. These are the facts.Since the election of this government, we have sought to bring this legislation to fruition. We began in June 2008, when the CPRS green paper was released. There was the Garnaut review in September 2008 and the CPRS white paper, released in December 2008. Then in March this year, nearly nine months ago, we produced draft legislation for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We have also introduced the renewable energy target legislation, boosting to 20 per cent the amount of electricity to be produced by renewable sources by 2020. We have had countless inquiries over a long, long time, we have had countless Senate investigations, we have had countless industry consultations, and the time for action has well and truly come. That is why we must rise to the occasion and rise to the challenge and get this deal done this week in this parliament.This week the Australian parliament reaches the culmination of 30 years worth of science, some 10 years of development of a cap-and-trade scheme for Australia and some two years of specific work on the design character of a carbon pollution reduction scheme. This week Minister Wong will bring the proposed deal to the cabinet of Australia for its consideration. Following cabinet endorsement, the deal will be put to our - that is, the Australian Labor Party - party room so that it has whole-of-government support. Tomorrow morning, the government's endorsed package and the draft amendments will be provided to the opposition for their final consideration.The deal that we put to the opposition is a deal for this week. The government is focused on passing the legislation this week. The reason for that is that the clock is ticking for us all. I say to those opposite: the government is willing to extend the time available for parliamentary sittings should it be necessary to bring about a vote on the scheme this week. There are times in our national politics when all Australians require us to reach beyond the normal partisan divide and to frame an agreement in the national interest. I believe we have reached such a time in Australia. We have reached such a time in Australia this week.I believe that climate change represents a challenge of our times to which we in the parliament must rise. So I appeal to all those on opposition benches who are people of goodwill who wish to see the passage of climate change legislation to look beyond our normal partisan divide and join with the government to see the passage of this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme for the future. It is necessary for Australia, it is necessary for our national action, it is necessary to underpin our global action. I believe the eyes of the nation are on all of us in this House, government and opposition benches alike, this week.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. First of all, my advice is that we have 1,188 people accommodated there. Second, the capacity of the centre as it currently stands is 1,400. I am further advised that the department of immigration has recently sourced some 70 demountables to increase capacity further - I understand, by some 200 beds - by the end of December. I also understand that the department is exploring additional measures to increase capacity should that be required in the future. I also say to the honourable member in response to her question that, on the 10-hectare site available, the advice of the department is that there is room for that to occur.The second part of the honourable member's question goes to the processing of individuals on the mainland. I say to the honourable member that our policy is first and foremost mandatory detention; and, secondly, when it comes to the interdiction of vessels offshore, that we will seek to process those through mandatory detention on Christmas Island. As I have said already in answer to questions in this place, the immigration minister has already put on the record other contingency arrangements that have been put in place.So far, in the time of this government, I am advised that one vessel has reached the Australian mainland. All others have so far been interdicted offshore. That is why they have all been processed on Christmas Island. In the period of the previous government, I am advised about 15 per cent of vessels in fact made it to the Australian mainland and brought about a different set of circumstances for the processing of vessels at that time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. The rationale for the CPRS is very simple and it is very clear. By taking action now, we avoid larger costs for future generations, something everyone in this House should be concerned about, because climate change is a very serious economic challenge to future prosperity. It would be wonderful to think that it does not exist, but it does, and hard-headed governments must deal with it - and hard-headed governments around the world are dealing with it. They are dealing with it because it is an economic threat, not just an environmental threat.Australia has more to lose that just about every other developed nation, so there is an urgency in this country to deal with it, and we must, because every tonne of carbon that is pumped into the atmosphere imposes a cost on our community. It is a cost that is felt right across the community and right across the economy: hotter days, water restrictions, bushfires and drought. Of course, that is denied by so many opposite. But we are now experiencing only a fraction of the costs that will be left for future generations if we do not act, and that is why we must act.We now have and have had for some time the modelling from the Garnaut review. I would like to go through some of those conclusions because I think they are worth reviewing as we go into this debate through the next 24 hours. Increased temperature and reduced rainfall will cause substantial reductions in agricultural output. That should be obvious to just about anybody. The modelling forecasts a 92 per cent decline in irrigated agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin by the end of the century. Unmitigated climate change would disproportionately affect the price of food. Relative to other goods, Garnaut found that the cost of food could increase by more than 10 per cent.There are fundamental bread-and-butter impacts from climate change and long-term damage to the economy that many opposite simply will not face up to. They just want to put their head in the sand and wish it was not happening. But governments committed to hard-headed reforms, which protect our prosperity, know that in these circumstances we must act. Nobody else can act. We cannot leave it up to voluntary groups, welfare groups or volunteers. There is only one group in a society that can act in these circumstances and, of course, that is government. That is what members of this House are elected to do, to represent the community and protect the national economic interest.There is so much of this debate that reminds me of debates of earlier times about the hard-headed decisions that were taken, which were not necessarily popular at the time but which have ensured our prosperity. I well remember the debate about the introduction of national superannuation and how many on that side of the House went around and said, 'We cannot do this, it is a tax and it is a cost to business.' But it was right for the nation. As we go forward we have discovered just how important that long-term reform was to our economic prosperity. It has been demonstrated, particularly in the past 12 months, because that pool of superannuation savings has been absolutely critical in ensuring finance in this economy as we go forward. But there were plenty of people who were not prepared to take the hard decision back when that long-term reform was introduced and many of them were on that side of the House.What we have got to do is put aside the short-term scaremongering. What we have got to do is put in place policies for the long-term national interest that will look after future generations and of course do the right thing by our economy.Those opposite have got 24 hours to make up their minds. I hope they think long and hard about their position. I hope they don't do what they did with the economic stimulus, which was a short-term populist thing to oppose it in this House. I hope they don't do that. I hope they don't do what they did over the years when they did not invest in infrastructure. I hope they face up to the long-term responsibility and acknowledge that action is required. I hope they don't do what they have been doing recently by opposing in this House essential savings measures. Those opposite always take the easy decisions. What I hope is that there are enough in the party room that acknowledge the national interest and get behind this important long-term reform for our children and for the future prosperity of our national economy.</DOC>

 - Once the individuals have been appropriately treated, I am sure they will then be processed consistent with those procedures which apply to Christmas Island. That is the first point. The second point I would make in response to the honourable member's question is her interesting interview this morning about where in fact these individuals should be processed. It is a little bit confusing but, when asked about it this morning by Jon Faine on the radio, on the one hand you said that the opposition is saying that 'we should continue some sort of processing without allowing people to land in Australia,' now you are also, at the same time, saying that we 'should use facilities that are on the mainland'. Then the member for Murray goes on in her answer:There comes a time when a small place like Christmas Island simply cannot continue to have thousands upon thousands stacked up, even at the big facility that Christmas Island was when it was built.If you do not take them to Christmas Island, I suggest that the only alternative being advocated by the member for Murray is to bring them to the Australian mainland. Our policy is very simple: it is mandatory detention and it is based on processing offshore on Christmas Island consistent with the arrangements we have put in place for some time.</DOC>

 - I have not hidden my identity. I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He has taken a very keen interest in this issue given the vulnerability of Far North Queensland to climate change. This is, in any view, a momentous week potentially for those in Australia who support taking action on climate change.As the Prime Minister was saying a short while ago, if agreement can be finalised with the opposition then we can achieve as a nation a historic economic and environmental reform. It is important to remind ourselves why the government is so committed to acting on climate change. It is because the scientific case for action on climate change is very clear. The climate is warming and we need to act respond to it.In 1988, governments formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to analyse the peer reviewed scientific work of global scientists to inform policy making decisions. The IPCC has released four assessment reports that have confirmed the science and informed the international efforts to take action. The most recent such assessment report, released in 2007, has of course been informing the Copenhagen process. That report, the fourth assessment report, found that the observed warming of the climate is unequivocal, that the observed warming is very likely to be due to human activity and that projected warming of between 1.1 to 6.4 degrees centigrade can be expected by 2100. These findings have been both confirmed and strengthened by subsequent world leading scientific societies. Labor accepts the science and that is why the government has a strong record of action in dealing with climate change.We have ratified the Kyoto protocol. We have committed to international negotiations. We have commissioned the Garnaut climate change review. We have produced green and white papers. We have had extensive consultations with industry and environmental groups. We have set strong targets for emissions reductions. We have passed the renewable energy legislation. We have commenced the largest ever investment in energy efficiency. We have committed significant resources to explore carbon capture and storage and solar technology. We have committed to implement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and we need the CPRS so that we can begin the difficult work of reducing our greenhouse emissions.To that end, we need those opposite to support action on climate change. The government has been working hard to achieve agreement. But the opposition remains split into two camps and divided on the science. The member for Warringah has attracted a bit of attention in recent days. He has chopped and changed camps on the Liberal side of politics and he has got an unusual take on the science. The member for Warringah had this to say on Lateline last week in relation to the science:If you look at Roman times, grapes grew up against Hadrian's Wall. In Medieval times they grew crops in Greenland and in the 1700s they had ice fairs on the Thames.I do not think I can explain it to the House, Mr Speaker. We would have to have some peer review of the source material to work that out. The member for Warringah also had this to say back in October in no lesser material than Pyrenees Advocate. He said:The argument on climate change is absolute crap. However the politics of this are tough for us. Eighty per cent of people believe climate change is a real and present danger.So it is a political problem from the member for Warringah's point of view. The climate science, as he said, is 'absolute crap' in his opinion.But in Australian on 19 October when the member for Warringah was in the other camp - that is, the camp supporting the Leader of the Opposition and attempts to negotiate an agreement - this is what he had to say:It could indeed help the outcome of the Copenhagen climate change talks if Australia agreed in advance not only to a carbon emission target but also a mechanism to deliver it.That was a sound observation of course but it has been contradicted by a number of other statements. That is, as I have said, when the member for Warringah was in the Turnbull camp, wanting to negotiate. But now he seem to be in the Minchin camp, which is where in fairness he is probably most comfortable, fighting that international communist conspiracy out there. He has been attracted to that. I would leave the observations about the member for Warringah with no lesser authority than the Leader of the Opposition, who said this on 20 November, a few days ago, on the doors:Tony's expressed a number of views, each of which was at odds with the views he's expressed before.Say no more.Mr Speaker, as we approach this important and momentous moment when potentially the parliament is able to pass an emissions trading scheme and begin the hard work of emission reductions, all of those on that side of politics need to take responsibility, stand up for what is right in the national interest and work with the government to reduce emissions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. The answer to the honourable member's question is, no, I have made no such approach. Furthermore, I say to the honourable member for Curtin, consistent with government arrangements, which were long in place when she was a minister in the previous Howard government, that what normally occurs through the UNHCR and relevant governments around the world is that when it comes to the resettlement of individual applicants for refugee status either in places like Indonesia or elsewhere, individual countries are approached through the UNHCR for assistance. I imagine that is what will occur in this case. I imagine that is what will occur in future cases as well. In answer to the honourable member's question, though, I have made no such approach myself. I also say that, having reflected on -  -  - That was the question I was asked. I simply respond to the question as I was asked. I say to the member for Murray, the member for Farrer and the member for Curtin, the reason for them asking this question goes back of course to the Ronaldson doctrine on the following. Remember what the Ronaldson doctrine is; you don't get news stories by trying to change perceptions -  - Mr Speaker, the question went to the handling of asylum seekers. It went to the resettlement of asylum seekers. It went to a range of questions that I have been asked this morning and I am sure the deliberations between the member for Curtin and Senator Ronaldson have been of interest to many members here. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. If in fact there was a genuine debate being marshalled by those opposite about the normal resettlement procedures available under the refugees convention, then of course we would be seized to engage every element of that debate. But we know that it is not. It is all about what the Ronaldson doctrine is about, which is: you don't get news stories by trying to change perceptions; you get them by reinforcing stereotypes. That is what is going on here.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for the question. Last week representatives of governments from around the world gathered for the Global Food Summit, where we dealt with projections that by 2050 the global food supply will have to be in the order of 70 per cent higher than it is now. There are many challenges to food security around the world, including investing in agricultural development; increasing demand as a result of increasing global population; changes in land use; the need for improved market access; and, of course, climate change. While certainly not the only issue for global food security, climate change is one of the issues with which the nations of the world is wrestling.Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon put it best when he said 'there can be no food security without climate security'. As you go through the different continents of the world the challenges are different, whether it be drought, like our farmers in Australia are dealing with; the increase in the number of major weather events; or rising sea levels and the various pressures that occur there. In Asia, for example, a reduction of between 2.5 per cent and 10 per cent in crops is expected by 2020. Most recently, the Philippines has been experiencing some of the challenges that come with an increase in major weather events - the recent floods caused by typhoons Ondoy and Pepeng and the impact they have had on the rice crop. Can we say that those individual typhoons were climate change ones? No. But what we can say is that it is consistent with projections of an increased number of major weather events occurring throughout the world.At that event I was fortunate to co-chair with the Prime Minister of Bangladesh a roundtable on the connections between climate change and food security. In Bangladesh they are dealing with increased floods and rising sea levels - and what is often forgotten is that rising sea levels mean not merely a loss of agricultural land but also an increase in salinity levels as you go further upstream on river systems.The challenges of food security are many, and climate change is one of them. But it is one of the areas where the nations of the world need to act, and Australia needs to be among them.</DOC>

 - It is good to see that the Ronaldson doctrine has now been elevated to the Leader of the Opposition - which is in the great Australian newspaper published email entitled 'Digging dirt' and says, 'You don't get news stories by trying to change perceptions, you get them by reinforcing stereotypes.' That is what they are on about here. The Leader of the Opposition's question goes to numbers. I would draw his attention to the following numbers. When it comes to the decrease in numbers worldwide from countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka in the early 2000s, they were as follows: between 2001 and 2003 the number of Iraqis claiming asylum globally dropped by 50 per cent, from 52,000 down to 27,000; the number from Afghanistan dropped by 73 per cent; and the number from Sri Lanka dropped by 61 per cent. This is the period in which those opposite say that, uniquely as a consequence of their particular approaches to the Pacific solution - temporary protection visas and the like - there was some 'unique success' in this country. They must have been uniquely successful in multiple countries around the world, because those figures are global numbers coming out of each of those countries. All of these global factors were at work and the numbers out of all three countries were coming down. The opposition then latch on to it and say, 'It's all because of us.'And then of course we go to volume 2, which is what has been happening between 2005 and 2008. Guess what? The reverse occurs. The global increase in the number of Iraqis seeking asylum has gone up by 193 per cent. Secondly, the number of Afghans claiming asylum globally has gone up by 139 per cent. Furthermore, the number of Sri Lankans has gone up in that same period of time by 72 per cent - and the reason why that is occurring worldwide is because of security factors alive within those countries. - Mr Speaker, the question was about numbers. I believe I am answering that question. - Mr Speaker, the figures are as I have just described them. They are discomforting for those opposite because they actually go to what has happened globally, both in the early 2000s and recently. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition knows that he is engaging in an exercise which, on the facts, is simply unsustainable.Then we go to the question of policy responses. Here we have the policy responses announced by those opposite in their four-point plan on border protection which came out a week or so ago:1.We will once again secure our borders.Look for the detail - 'We will once again secure our borders.' This is the same policy which in times past saw nearly 250 boats arrive in Australia carrying nearly 15,000 people - and they say, 'We will once again secure our borders.'2. All processing offshore.Someone should remind the member for Murray that that is their policy because on two occasions, one last week and one this week, we have had a bit of a 'blippo' - haven't we, Member for Murray? - as she could not quite remember the script.Then, three - here is one to hold the phone. Listen to this one; it is consistent with what we have heard this morning:A compassionate and fair refugee and humanitarian program.Compassionate and fair. Well, hold the phone! That one is really worthy of gaining the newspaper headlines. Then, policy no. 4:A non-permanent visa for unauthorised arrivals.The temporary protection visa by another name; that which they have been speaking about for some weeks. This is their recommendation by way of a border protection policy. The temporary protection visa; what is its track record? After they brought it in we saw nearly 10,000 people arrive in this country. Subsequently, we saw 90 per cent of those granted TPVs being provided with permanent residence in Australia. That is the great magic being offered by temporary protection visas.Our approach is based on mandatory detention. Our approach is based on offshore processing on Christmas Island for vessels that we interdict on the high seas. Our policy is based on stringent ASIO assessment of the security profile of individuals. Our policy is based on stringent health assessment of the health profile of individuals. Our policy is based on those who are not deemed to have bona fide refugee status being sent back home as they have been already, to Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Our processes are also to apply the norms consistent with the UNHCR convention to which we are proud signatories. And we will not put kids behind razor wire.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know that he, like me and members of the government, is concerned that this nation is ready for the challenges of the future, including of course the profound challenge of climate change. The science is in. The action that needs to be taken by this parliament this week is to pass the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Of course this measure is fundamental to this nation's cutting its carbon emissions and getting ready to meet the challenge of future climate change. Work is already under way on ensuring that skills and training are ready to meet the challenge of the future - the challenge of climate change. We of course know that adapting to a low carbon economy is going to change the way that we work and the way that we live. Consequently, the government is already moving to change skills and training so workers can have the skills they will need for this low-carbon future.I am very pleased to report that on Friday, when I met with tertiary education and employment ministers from around nation, we were able to agree on our National Green Skills Agreement to ensure that training around the country has embedded in it the new skills that workers will need for a carbon constrained economy. This is an important agreement to changing the content of training packages for some of our most traditional trades. Obviously, some of our most traditional trades will need new green skills, whether it is motor mechanics learning to work on hybrid vehicles, whether it is plumbers learning to deal with the way in which people want to use waste water now, and whether it is electricians who are getting ready to deliver the newly designed buildings that will use less energy and less electricity, we want to embed these new green skills in training packages. This agreement ensures that for trade apprentices who commence training after 1 January next year these new green skills will be embedded in what they study so they are ready to take their place in a low carbon economy.This of course builds on work that the government has already done with an investment of $94 million to provide 50,000 young Australians with job and training opportunities in new green skills. Then of course it builds on the $200 million investment that we are making to upgrade TAFE institutes so they too are ready to teach the green skills that we will need in the future. The time for denying climate change has passed. The time for inaction has passed. We, as a nation, need to move forward. We need to make sure that working people in this nation have the skills they need for a low carbon economy. We need to make sure this nation has in place a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and that is the task before this parliament this week.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I recall very clearly my visit to Port Macquarie and the time I spent with him and others speaking to the staff at Port Macquarie Base Hospital about their particular needs. The fact is that in Port Macquarie, as I was advised, you have a hospital which was essentially designed around what was estimated to be the needs for that region in the early nineties, and here we are at the end of the first decade of this century and its physical capacity has not been substantially increased. - The interjection from the member for North Sydney is 'It should've remained a private hospital.' I will not go into the details of the evolution of this one but can I say to the member for North Sydney, who has suddenly become an expert on these matters, and to the member for Lyne, who legitimately represents the interests of his constituents, that the entire saga which has gone before with this hospital, namely the evolution between private ownership and state ownership, has not been a happy one for the local constituents. That is what should drive all our concerns here.The member for Lyne raises a concern about when we will take structural action in relation to the reform of the health and hospital system and whether it will be substantial action - if I got his question correctly. As I said prior to the last election, the Australian people are sick and tired of a blame game between the Australian government and state governments on the future reform of the health and hospital system. Some basic facts need to be put before the parliament, the first of which is the ageing of our population. Secondly, there is the growth of our population. You have seen the projections referred to by the member for Lyne in his question: up to some 35 million people by mid-century. Thirdly, there is the exponential increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals for treating those within our health and hospital system. Fourthly, there is the woeful job that has been done in times past in properly planning for our health workforce requirements - our doctors, our nurses and our allied health professionals.All these things are bearing down on a health and hospital system which, in the advice of Christine Bennett, who delivered the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report not long ago, is a system now at tipping point. There are 750 public hospitals across the country. The figures when it comes to elective surgery and to treatment within clinically acceptable waiting times at accident and emergency have not seen any significant improvement over a long period of time. These are the facts.The question is: what proposals do we have before us and how can we change that for the future? What we have got before the Australian people and of course before the health and hospital community at the moment is two sets of strategic options. One, of course, involves a partial takeover of the system by the Australian government. The second is a two-stage full Australian government takeover of the entire system. They are the strategic options we are presented with. Each of the elements of primary healthcare reform - GPs, acute hospital care, post-acute care, aged care, dental care and mental health needs - are canvassed exhaustively within that report.Our process for making these decisions is as follows. We are going to have a meeting with the Council of Australian Governments next month and we will then, with the states and territories, discuss in detail the options that we have been presented with through that report and seek their direct response to what is canvassed in that report in addition to their statement of the strengths and weaknesses within their own systems. Secondly, we have also indicated that in the first part of 2010 we will then convene a further meeting of the Council of Australian Governments in order to bring forward our recommendations for future long-term policy reform.My view very simply - and I put this to the member for Lyne in terms of his question - is that the days for simply frittering around the edges on this debate have gone. What we actually need is a government prepared to step up to the plate with the states and territories and embark upon a long-term policy reform. - Right on cue, the member for Pyne interjects: when are we going to act! - Member for Pyne, member for Sturt, the pining member for Pyne, the pining member for Sturt.For 12 years - I asked this question the other day - where was their healthcare reform plan? Where was their hospital reform plan? - Was he the minister for health at some stage? - He never made it that far? I lost count of what he was responsible for, but can I say: for 12 years they did two things. Firstly, they pulled out a billion dollars from the public hospital system in Australia and, secondly, they put forward no reform plan at all for the future of our hospitals, for the future of Australia - not one. All they did was play the old game: blame the states, make sure that you can whip it up into a frenzy prior to an election, get through, make sure that you did not cop any responsibility yourself and get home free. That was their approach. Ours is different. You have seen it in the Bennett commission report. That is the blueprint we have put out there. We are consulting with hospitals around the country at the moment and we will adhere to the timetable that we have foreshadowed, which is in close consultation with the states and territories, because the nation wants long-term hospital reform. We intend to deliver that in partnership with the states and territories.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question and I congratulate him and indeed other members of this House who have been such passionate and determined advocates for their electorates who have suffered the consequences of natural disasters. The people of his electorate, like indeed all Australians, are unquestionably concerned about the likelihood of more severe and frequent natural disasters.The facts are that climate change is real and, as the honourable member said, it is projected to lead to more intense cyclones, floods and storms, more heatwaves and droughts and indeed, unfortunately, to even greater bushfire risks. For instance, by 2030 it is estimated that we will face up to 20 per cent more months of drought and up to 25 per cent more days of very high or greater fire danger. The increased risk to human beings, to property, to infrastructure and to our natural environment is obvious.Last week we saw extensive fires throughout Australia but very intense fires in South Australia. Over the weekend we saw temperatures of over 40 degrees in New South Wales, with winds gusting up to 70 kilometres an hour. This resulted in some 141 different fires around that state alone. They were fought by 1,000 firefighters, including two teams from the ACT, and we are grateful, of course, for that. There were 75 aircraft involved and 550 fire trucks. The Commonwealth government was pleased to make the Richmond Air Force base available to assist the aerial firefighting effort.We of course are very grateful to all those who risked their personal safety both over the weekend and last week, but it shows the tremendous cost to the community, not only in terms of fighting fires but in terms of responding. In the past year, for instance, the Commonwealth has paid nearly $300 million in natural disaster relief and recovery payments, and this amount will substantially increase in response to the more intense and more frequent natural disasters. Given that that money matches contributions from state governments, it shows that the burden on Australian taxpayers from natural disasters is intense and will likely increase.Last Friday I chaired the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management. It was highly productive and I certainly thank my state and territory counterparts for their very constructive contributions. We endorsed a number of initiatives including a National Catastrophic Natural Disaster Plan, we developed a national work plan to reduce bushfire arson, and significantly the meeting also endorsed a National Climate Change Adaption Plan. The plan, essentially, will ensure that climate change adaption strategies are integral to emergency management, planning, response and recovery.This bushfire season unquestionably poses great risks. On 20 October I made a comprehensive statement to the House about our preparations for this season. Of course, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist states and territories, in whatever way we can, to confront the challenge that faces all Australians, particularly those in rural and regional Australia and those on the urban fringe. I remind all Australians, particularly those in high-risk areas, to do everything they can to be prepared for bushfires, to be vigilant and to follow the instructions of emergency personnel.Again, and I should emphasise this, if we are serious in doing all we can to protect our local communities from natural disasters - and I know that all members from both sides of this House are - then we cannot ignore the reality, we cannot ignore the evidence, we cannot ignore the facts. We have an obligation to do whatever we reasonably can do to mitigate the effects of climate change.</DOC>

 - The good news is that it was 26 days since we had the last question on education, 33 days, by the way, since we last had a question on the economy and 101 days since we had our last question on jobs. We should all say to give Joe a job, let him have a go, let's get some questions rolling. But I go back to the question which was asked by our personal House favourite, the member for Sturt. He asked about school chaplaincy. How does all this resonate with some of the debates we have been hearing in recent times, because I sense the build-up of an attempt at a little bit of a fear campaign in the lead-up to the next election - a fear that, somehow, the government will not be committed long term to school chaplaincies. - He says, 'They are not.' Can I say to the member for Sturt, as he constantly interjects, that so deep and profound were the previous government's commitments to this that they put it into the forward estimates for only three years. When challenged about whether it was to be a permanent feature of long-term allocation under the previous Howard government, they ran for cover. It was not entrenched in the forward estimates, there was no forward budget for it, it was not brought into the future operations of the budget. It was treated as a one-off for three years and then dropped dead. That was how it was funded. It might be uncomfortable for those opposite, including the member for Sturt, to admit the reality as to what the budget papers actually said, but they simply dropped dead - three years!I am so sorry that the member for Sturt now will not be able to whip up his fear campaign in the next 12 months or so. I am always delighted when the member for Sturt says that somebody squibbed it. Can I say to the member for Sturt that what I have done, what the government have done and what the education minister and Deputy Prime Minister has done is to say to the schools chaplaincy organisation for Australia, 'Here is certainty of funding through 2010-11.' During the course of 2010 we are going to work with the sector on this. How do we provide more chaplaincies in the future for people in rural Australia who are not getting a fair shake at the moment? How are we going to provide more chaplaincies in the future for those from the most disadvantaged areas of Australia? Because at present, of the 2,700 chaplains who are funded by this program nationwide, there is an underrepresentation of those from rural areas; there is an underrepresentation from some of the most disadvantaged parts of Australia.We actually would like to see this program extended to other parts of the country. That is why we are going to take time working our way through this with the sector during the course of 2010. That is why we have responded to the request from the sector to provide certainty for the year ahead and the year following. That is why the sector have welcomed the statement made by the government over the weekend. That is why honourable members from all around Australia, in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and other states, in response to their school communities have been receiving phone call after phone call over the last several days saying that this is fantastic news and that we have certainty for the next two years ahead.Can I say to those opposite, the only one who seems to be disappointed by this outcome is the member for Sturt, because the member for Sturt has had his own little attempt to whip up a fear campaign on behalf of his marginal seat members collapse from underneath him. We support school chaplaincies, that is why we are funding them to the tune of an additional $42 million on top of that which was provided by the previous government. We provided certainty for the future and we will get on with the job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and know that, as a member of this parliament representing a regional electorate, she cares about support for country children going to university. Unfortunately the Liberal and National parties do not. They continue their war against students; the war against students they started in government when they sat there as a government and watched the participation rates of kids from country backgrounds go down - something that they should be ashamed of, watching the participation rates of country students go down.This is a government that is committed to supporting access to education and particularly access for disadvantaged groups including country students. That is why we have before the Senate a new and improved student financing arrangement which better targets money to those households and those students that need it the most. Who supports this new set of arrangements? Well, people who care about education do. Australia's universities do. Last week I was joined by representatives of every university system in the country, standing shoulder to shoulder with me, calling on the Liberal and National parties to get out the way and pass this bill. Since that time the Group of Eight vice chancellors - the vice chancellors of our oldest and most prestigious universities - have issued a press release directed at the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal and National parties. It is entitled Student income support is not a political plaything, and that is absolutely true. The Group of Eight has said in this press release:The Group of Eight supports these changes because they target finite resources to the students most in need, including those in rural and regional areas.All universities support this bill. Student organisations support this bill. So there are the Liberal and National parties, in their arrogance and in their war against students, having presided as a government over declining participation rates by country children, now setting their face against expert advice from universities around this country. There was a time when the Liberal Party had the decency to acknowledge that its student financing system was inequitable. Those days of decency were when the member for Casey was shadow minister for education and he slammed the old Liberal system - as he rightly should -  - because the participation rate of country children was going down. That is the shambles, the management of the Liberal and National parties that saw that happen to country kids. Yes, the member for Sturt is right. Their administration was a shambles. And the member for Casey was right when he said:_ it has become too easy for students from affluent backgrounds to qualify and too difficult for students from modest backgrounds _He was right when he went on, saying that the current system:_ particularly disadvantages many students - particularly those from the country - who have to leave home to study _The member for Casey was right about that, but that sentiment is not reflected in the current actions of the Liberal and National parties, who are determined to stop a bill and are determined to rip money out of the hands of country kids at the start of next year.We know that universities are opposed to the strategy of the Liberal and National parties. Students are opposed to the strategy of the Liberal and National parties. All universities are opposed. The member for Murray, ring your local vice chancellor and see if your local vice chancellor supports the strategy you are on, to rip out of the hands of country kids - 773 of them in your electorate - scholarship money for next year. Vice chancellors do not support the Liberal and National parties. Students do not support the attitude of the Liberal and National parties. The former education spokesperson does not support the current attitude of the Liberal and National parties. When you want a guide to what the backbench of the Liberal Party is actually thinking it always pays to consult that great journal of record, the Daily Liberal. From the Daily Liberal last week we learned that, despite the pontificating of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for education, the Liberal backbench actually likes that trade training centres program. From the Daily Liberal we now learn, in the words of the member for Parkes, that they are hoping that this student financing matter is resolved. The member for Parkes in the Daily Liberal says he hopes agreement will be achieved so that rural and remote families know where they are heading. He goes on to say:It's not fair for students, parents and schools to be left dangling without clear guidelines on Youth Allowance.The member for Parkes is right. What he needs to do is take the short walk and say to his shadow minister, 'Stop trying to rip off country kids because no one supports you doing it.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because it enables me to explain some facts - things that the Liberal Party does not like when it comes to education. The facts stand about their track record in government where they discriminated against country kids; where this nation came back of the OECD class for investment in early childhood; where the standards of schools in this country against the standards of the world went down; and where the man who sits next to the member who asked the question sat there saying, 'We knew a skills shortage was coming; we just did not bother doing anything about it.' Their track record in government is one that bears repeating when it comes to the facts. On these schools that he has asked me about let me explain the situation to him very clearly. There are water pipes under an area of the Berwick Lodge school that was first identified for construction. The local water authority has ruled out constructing on that spot because of the nature of the pipes and other work that runs under it and consequently an alternative position for the construction will be identified. This is the kind of problem that anybody with a modicum of common sense knows happens when you are dealing with construction. On the question of lack of common sense, here it comes -  - Thank you very much. I was asked about a building at a particular school, and I am answering about that building at that school. On the comparison that the member has drawn with St Lucy's, let me just explain to the member that, of course, the amount of funding that this government has allocated to students with disabilities has in fact gone up. We allocate that to school systems. We allocate it in particular to the Catholic school system. The Catholic school system, as it did when the Liberal Party was in government, makes determinations about allocations for the school within its system. Consequently, there is more money available to the system overall and it has made its determinations, including the determination for St Lucy's School. If the member wants to take that up with the Catholic Education Office then he should, but he should not be drawing an inappropriate, inaccurate comparison in this House in the attempt to confuse or mislead people, because that is completely wrong.Can I say to the member opposite: this is a government that has almost doubled allocations of funding to schools over a four-year period. We are doing that to drive a fundamental reform agenda, including transparency, which you were too incompetent in government to do; including a national curriculum, which the Liberal and National parties were too incompetent to do; including directing more money to disadvantaged schools, which is something the Liberals and Nationals in government could not have cared less about; including money for teacher quality reforms, such as Teach for Australia which provides more money for the best teachers in the country to go to the classrooms that need them the most - a reform you would never have dreamed of and could not have delivered even if you tried. There is the Digital Education Revolution, the Building the Education Revolution, trade training centres in schools -  -  - Yes, it is embarrassing for you, isn't it? Yes, it is. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In conclusion: the waste was almost 12 long years when education in this country went backwards. We are delivering an education revolution because we believe Australian students deserve better. The real tragedy is that we will never get those almost 12 long years back and kids only get one go at school. So what the member should be reflecting on is the thousands of school children that the Liberal and National parties let down with their track record of insufficient resources and insufficient reforms. That is the real waste that this House should be directing its attention to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lowe for his question. I know that, along with all members of this House, people understand the great challenge we have in fighting cancer in our community. It remains the No. 1 burden of disease in Australia. Unfortunately, one in three men and one in four women will be diagnosed with cancer before the age of 75. This year, cancer will claim the lives of approximately 40,000 Australians. Although we know that Australia has relatively good survival rates compared to international results, outcomes are not as good for the 30 per cent of Australians who live in rural and regional Australia. I know that is why many members on this side of the House, and I dare say some on the other side of the House, were pleased last week when the Deputy Prime Minister and I announced the next phase of our plans to help improve cancer services and outcomes for regional Australia.Applications are now open for the $560 million available for the Regional Cancer Centres Initiative. We are now calling for innovative applications from public and private sectors to establish a network of around 10 cancer centres which will help improve access to services in regional Australia and help close that gap in cancer outcomes between the city and the country. Applications for the Regional Cancer Centres Initiative are open until Friday, 8 January. They are a key part of our historic $2 billion investment in cancer care, which was announced in this year's budget. Our commitment also includes $526 million for two integrated cancer centres - one at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute in Melbourne and another at the Lifehouse Chris O'Brien Cancer Centre in Sydney. The Prime Minister was at the RPA last week for the Chris O'Brien dinner. We look forward to turning the first sod soon. These flagship centres will become one-stop shops for patients, with state-of-the-art treatment, support services and research all under the one roof.We are also continuing to roll out more cancer research and services. At the Bathurst community cabinet, for example, where the Prime Minister and I held a health consultation earlier this month with the member for Macquarie, the Prime Minister and I were pleased to meet two of the McGrath Foundation breast cancer nurses and were able on that occasion to announce that all 44 nurses have now been recruited and are at work in those 44 communities, providing additional services to breast cancer patients. Last Sunday, I also announced that the government is providing another $2½ million to continue the National Skin Cancer Awareness Campaign this summer to help educate and inform Australians, particularly young Australians, about the dangers of sun exposure. Unfortunately, Australia is No. 1 when you look internationally at skin cancer incidence in the world. This is not one of the instances where we wish to be No. 1 and is something we are determined to address.Last Thursday I was pleased to join the chief executives of Cancer Australia and the NHMRC and some of our key peak cancer stakeholders in announcing funding of $12½ million to fund 42 innovative cancer research projects. These grants are going to help keep us at the cutting edge of cancer research. Consider these investments helping us tackle cancer by investing in research, cancer services infrastructure and cancer prevention. The Rudd government is working hard to tackle cancer on all of these fronts. We know, of course, that there is much more to be done to beat this dreadful disease but we intend to keep working with researchers, clinicians, stakeholders and patients to build a world-class cancer centre and service system for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think, like all members of the House, we share deep concerns, as government and as opposition, for those who have become the civilian victims of terrorist attacks anywhere in the world. In the case of Australians, we are, regrettably in this chamber, all too familiar with the impact that has had on Australian lives. All of us who were in this chamber at the time remember the extraordinary impact of the Bali bombing and of course what happened subsequent to that with further terrorist attacks. And Australians have been involved in and affected by other terrorist attacks around the world.On the question of the legislation which the honourable member refers to, I presume it is a private member's bill. I am not familiar with the contents of his bill. I assume it has been advanced into the chamber in good spirit and good heart. Therefore, in deference to the honourable member's motivation, we will subject it to examination. Consistent with the objects concerning the bill, as described by the honourable member in putting forward his private member's bill, let us examine it and see what practical things can be done to assist Australians in these circumstances. As I think all of us would know here, it being now some years since the Bali bombing where we had 80 or 90 Australians who were directly affected in lives being lost, there were many others who were injured by that as well. Then there are the rolling consequences which extend years and years into the future. In the spirit with which the question was asked, we will submit this to examination and in due course come back to the honourable member.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. I know that she shares this government's vision for a childcare sector in Australia that is accessible, affordable and of high quality - we have been delivering on all three of these areas. In terms of accessibility, we are investing $970 million to ensure that all children have access to preschool in the year prior to school. We are also delivering $114.5 million for the establishment of 38 new centres across Australia and we have been investing $12.8 billion to improve affordability for parents. We have delivered on our election commitment to increase the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We know that this has dramatically improved affordability, with ABS statistics now showing that childcare costs to parents actually fell by over 20 per cent as a result. In total, we are investing some $16 billion in child care over four years, which is $1 billion more each and every year than the previous government did. We do this because we know that early childhood is a critical time, a time which shapes children's development, their learning and their wellbeing outcomes. That is why we are now turning our attention to the quality reform agenda when it comes to Australian child care.We know that the one million families who have children in child care deserve to know, when they drop their children off in the mornings, that they will get the best care possible throughout the day. We have all seen too many reports about children being injured at child care or wandering off due to inadequate supervision and we know that this is not acceptable. Recent reports found that in Queensland alone more than 2,000 services were issued with compliance letters regarding issues with quality. I can inform the House that national regulatory data show that these safety issues are not isolated. The data show that over one-quarter of long day care services were found to be unsatisfactory in ensuring that potentially dangerous products, plants and objects were inaccessible to children. They show that 20 per cent of services were found to be unsatisfactory in making sure that the building and equipment used by children were safe, that almost a quarter of services were found to be unsatisfactory in supporting each child's need for comfort, sleep and rest, and that almost a quarter were unsatisfactory in toileting and nappy changing procedures. We on this side of the House find this entirely unacceptable.Whilst we know that the dedicated staff out there in the sector are doing their best each and every day, there are clearly some issues that they and we as a government want to address and want to see improved. We want to improve staff-to-child ratios so that each staff member has fewer children in their care, which means that each child gets greater individual time and attention, something we know they need. We also want to raise staff qualifications so that staff are fully aware of the practices necessary to ensure safe environments for children, so that they can lead play activities and inspire youngsters to help them learn.We need to do better for our children. Those opposite and the shadow spokesperson have accused us of being obsessed with a quality agenda. To this I absolutely plead guilty as charged. We make no apology whatsoever for prioritising safety and quality for our children and we will continue to work to ensure that Australian child care is accessible, affordable and of the highest possible quality.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Can I simply say that no decisions have been made whatsoever in terms of the future location of further airport facilities in Sydney. -  - Off they go, again, with another fear campaign - a fear campaign on school chaplaincies, a fear campaign on airports, a fear campaign on asylum seekers, a fear campaign on debt and deficit. What have I left out? A fear campaign on climate change as well. That is the stock-and-standard approach. I simply say to those opposite that the national interest dictates that Sydney will need new airport capacity. -  - Let us just say to those opposite that this is called planning for long-term infrastructure needs. That is why we have invited the New South Wales government to participate in a joint study to assess options, identify potential sites and evaluate investment strategies for delivering additional airport capacity. The joint study will also look at ways of providing integrated transport solutions for the existing airport as well as any second airport. It will also consider the future of the Badgerys Creek site, given that the government has ruled it out as an option for a second airport. The study's final terms of reference will be outlined in the aviation white paper, which is expected to be released shortly. That is the proper framework within which we will examine these matters.The aviation white paper is scheduled to be released by the end of the year and our commitment to the Australian people is to develop, for the first time, a national aviation policy - something which the previous government did not have. The white paper will set out an aviation strategy for the next generation and the white paper will focus on improving aviation safety and security, making sure we have an economically efficient sector that creates jobs in the short and long term. The government has consulted widely for its white paper through last December's green paper. That is the proper way in which you consider these things. That is the approach which has been supported by the minister responsible and that is the approach that we will be adopting, as a responsible government, on this nation's long-term infrastructure needs.I make a general point about infrastructure. For years and years and years the nation was crying out for a national infrastructure plan. How are we going to lay out our transport infrastructure in the future? What about our major ports for the future? What about our major freight rail links for the future? What about our national highway network for the future? What about the huge challenges of urban transport and urban public transport? We are in the business of advancing a national infrastructure plan and we intend to get on with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question and for her ongoing interest and commitment when it comes to providing care for our older Australians. Australians are living longer and healthier lives, which of course is great news - in fact, we have one of the longest life expectancies in the world. Our older Australians have a very strong desire to retain their independence and to remain in their homes close to family, friends and community for as long as they can. The government recognises this and, indeed, governments throughout the country recognise this through our Home and Community Care program. We do that to provide funding for services to make sure this can happen so that people can remain in their own homes.Home and Community Care is a joint Australian, state and territory government program. It delivers affordable and accessible care to help meet the needs of older people and their carers. In fact, last year the Rudd government provided $1.1 billion of the nearly $1.8 billion in funding provided for these HACC services. HACC offers services such as household chores, home maintenance and modification, transport, meals, personal care, allied health and nursing care. These are all practical and common-sense services provided to older Australians so that they can remain in their homes for longer.As the 2007-08 HACC annual report detailed, HACC provided services to 600,000 older Australians. This is the first time there has been an annual report in relation to HACC services. What that report also showed is that eight million hours of domestic assistance - practical and common-sense assistance - has been provided. I have had the opportunity to see firsthand the benefits that HACC services bring to older Australians. I have seen the benefit of those services right across Australia. In fact, I was very pleased recently to visit a Canberra couple, Mr and Mrs Eckholt, who told me how these HACC services made a real difference to their lives and meant they were able to stay in their own home for longer.In addition to this HACC funding, the Commonwealth government provided $730 million in the last financial year for Commonwealth community care services, and there are now more than 59,000 older Australians who receive assistance through these packages to make sure that they can remain in their homes longer. There is also our commitment to transition care as well - keeping people out of hospital, getting them out of hospital quicker and making sure they get home much quicker. The Rudd government understands that older Australians want to remain in their homes and in their communities, the communities that they help build. We are doing that. We are supporting our older Australians by providing more services and more funding than ever before.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. I would draw his attention to one core fact and that is that, under the Australian Health Care agreement signed by the Minister for Health and Ageing at the end of last year, we increased the allocation for health and hospitals by 50 per cent, against that which we inherited from the previous government. Secondly, I say in response to the honourable member's question that it stands in stark contrast to the $1 billion that he and his government pulled out of the public hospital system of Australia. To put that into context, what we inherited in an Australian healthcare agreement was $42 billion -  - That was the missing member for - what seat was he going for on the Gold Coast? - McPherson. He is still in search of a political home, our good friend the member for Dickson. I am sure the locals hold him in fond regard as he goes quietly slinking back to Brisbane's north side, having been rejected on the south side. We always welcome his contributions to the debate.In public hospitals in various parts of the country, for the first time what we have done is provided a direct investment in elective surgery. We have provided, for the first time, a direct investment in bringing down the waiting times for people in accident and emergency. For the first time, we have provided a direct investment in post-acute services. These are the investments that we have made, and the overall healthcare agreement increased from some $40 billion to something like $64 billion for the five years ahead. They take a billion dollars out; we put $20 billion-plus back in over that period. And they stand up and say, 'Where is your plan?' That is what we have done so far. Phase 2 of our reform is for the long-term, the next 25 years. Our program for implementing it is getting on. - Oh, Joe, you're back! I thank the honourable member for his question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question and her concern for such a serious and important matter. It is the duty of all governments to protect their nation's children and, wherever possible, it is the duty of all to protect children around the world. That is why the government is proposing to comprehensively reform Commonwealth criminal offences relating to all forms of child exploitation. These reforms will ensure that all behaviour constituting a sexual offence when committed against Australian children is also criminalised when committed by Australians overseas. These reforms will strengthen child sex tourism laws.There will be new offences for the grooming and procuring of children for sex overseas and an offence of preparing to commit a child sex tourism offence. These offences will ensure that police do not have to wait until the offender leaves Australia, endangering children in a destination country, in order to prosecute them. New aggravated offences will also be introduced, increasing penalties for offenders who exploit a position of trust or a child victim who has a cognitive impairment. Offenders will be able to be prosecuted for persistent sexual abuse of a child overseas, in recognition that the majority of violent acts against children are perpetrated by people who are part of their lives - in their family, in their schools or in care and justice systems - and are perpetrated on a regular basis for an extended period of time.The proposed reforms will also ensure that child sexual exploitation is prevented, investigated and prosecuted, whether it is committed online, through the post or using mobile phones. Child pornography hurts children over and over again. The production of images involves the initial abuse of child victims. The subsequent distribution of the pornography amplifies the original harm. So we are increasing the maximum penalties for online child pornography from 10 to 15 years imprisonment. Child pornography is also increasingly a transnational crime, with networks facilitated by the anonymity of the internet. This was demonstrated in a horrific way by the global child pornography ring identified during Operation Achilles, an Australian led international operation. This is why we are introducing new offences relating to child pornography networks that carry a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.These new offences take into account the operational experience of the Australian Federal Police, changes to the way in which technology is being used to sexually exploit children and best practice domestically and internationally. I can say that there has been consultation on these reforms. That consultation process has now ended. A number of submissions were received, including from state and territory governments, Child Wise and Save the Children. Child Wise was instrumental in lobbying the federal government to enact the first child sex tourism laws in 1994. In their submission, Bernadette McMenamin, CEO of Child Wise, states that she 'applauds the federal government for producing such an innovative approach to the law enforcement and prosecution of child sex tourism offences'. Existing child sex tourism offences were introduced over 14 years ago. The regime needs to be updated to ensure that we protect our children here and overseas. These laws will respond to this very important challenge.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that on a day like today, when the nation is debating the future of climate change, we could have had some discussion in this chamber of this important challenge for the nation as well, but apparently not. The honourable member raises a question concerning the arrival of boats in Australia. Could I draw to his attention the following: so far in the year 2009 we have had 45 boats arrive -  - The honourable member interjects, 'Forty-five too many.' In the year 2001 there were 44, which brought a total of 5,516; in the year 2000 there were 51 that brought just under 3,000 individuals to Australia; and in 1999 there were some 86 vessels and those 86 vessels brought 3,721 individuals. Can I draw those facts to the honourable gentleman's attention opposite and to his interjecting colleagues.Furthermore, in relation to the government's border protection policy, first of all, when it comes to the change that the government introduced for temporary protection visas, those opposite did not object to those changes when they were brought into this parliament - that is the first point. The second is that those opposite, when we indicated that we were not going to continue with the Pacific solution, were led by the indefatigable member for Murray, who, when asked her position on this change, 'Did she support it?', answered, 'I do.' That is the second element of policy. As for children behind razor wire, I assume that those opposite are not planning to reintroduce children behind razor wire. So, when those opposite talk about what difference in policy they would have for the future, I would be very interested to know wherein that change lies.For the period that the Howard government was in office nearly 250 boats arrived in Australia carrying some nearly 15,000 people. Every government in Australia, past, present and future, will deal with the challenge of border protection. This will largely be shaped by international security circumstances. In the period 2001 to 2003, as those opposite know, the total number of global exits from countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka went down significantly. They were the numbers I referred to the House yesterday. Those opposite would also be aware of the fact that, because of changes in security circumstances in Iraq, Afghanistan as well as in Sri Lanka, since 2005, globally, the number of exits from those countries has gone up as well, which is why, for example, you now have thousands if not tens of thousands of Sri Lankans heading in the direction of Europe and heading in the direction of North America by one means or another. It is why you have had 130,000 or so move across the waters separating Sri Lanka and India to the Indian mainland, and why on top of that this represents a global challenge.Against those numbers I would draw to the attention of the House that as of now we have had from Sri Lanka some 600 to 700 arrivals against the 130,000 who have gone next door to India and the thousands if not tens of thousands who have gone to other parts of the world. Once again, I would suggest that when those opposite engage in debate about border protection they reflect honestly on the past, reflect objectively on the historical circumstances which confront all countries at the moment and embrace a rational policy for the future on this important question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. Responding to climate change will be the great challenge for this generation. If we do not rise to the challenge what we will end up doing is condemning future generations of Australians to live with the consequences of our failure. This government has resolved to act. Climate change is not an abstract concept, it is not an abstract problem and it does not exist over the horizon; it is here, it is present, it is real and its consequences are being felt across every continent on earth.If we go to the science itself, the IPCC reports that the global carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere have risen by 38 per cent in the industrial era, from 280 to 385 parts per million. Secondly, the 4,000 scientists associated with that body have indicated that this has contributed to a rise in the earth's surface temperature of around 0.7 degrees during the course of the 20th century. Furthermore, climate model projections estimate that the global surface temperature will probably rise by a further 1.1 to 6.4 degrees Celsius during the course of the 21st century. This must seize our attention.The impacts of climate change environmentally are already being seen across the world. In the past 20 years Antarctica has lost seven of its ice shelves. This year a 25-mile-wide stretch of ice connecting the Wilkins shelf to the Antarctic landmass broke away, cutting that shelf from the Antarctic continent altogether. If temperature rises continue over time, the loss, for example, of the West Antarctic ice sheet would, we are advised, increase sea levels by 3.3 metres and accelerate global temperature rises. The consequences of climate change will affect the environment, our economy and our way of life. A sea level rise of just 50 centimetres would mean that 150 million people around the world could be flooded by extreme sea levels. The IPCC estimates that by 2020 up to 250 million people in Africa could face severe food shortages and water shortages. Furthermore, the British medical journal the Lancet has described climate change as 'the biggest global health threat of the 21st century'.Put all these factors together and what we have is an extraordinary challenge not only environmentally but also to the earth's human population. Scientists have translated the challenge of the worst effects of dangerous climate change into some simple numbers for those of us in the global policy community to deal with. We must keep the warming of our planet below two degrees Centigrade. This is equivalent to keeping the concentration of carbon dioxide equivalents in the atmosphere below 450 parts per million. This means halving global emissions by 2050.The challenge is significant, but the international community does have the capacity to rise to this challenge if we can summon the political will. We know that the costs of adjustment are manageable, we know that the technology to underpin such an adjustment is deliverable and we know that the earlier we act the easier our task will be. These are the challenges which lie before us. No nation can deal with climate change on its own, but if every nation stands back and simply refuses to act until all other countries act we know where that logic takes us, and that is that no country acts at all. The resolve of this Australian government is clear. We as a government have resolved to act on climate change. We have resolved to act nationally on climate change. We have resolved to act globally on climate change. Our national action consists of our renewable energy target being increased to 20 per cent, our embrace of measures to underpin energy efficiency across the Australian economy and the introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.The purpose of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is, of course, to bring about a carbon price in the Australian economy. Our overall concerns with the CPRS and the negotiations we have entered into in good faith with the opposition have been to deliver an environmentally effective, fiscally responsible mechanism for the future which enables us to have in Australia a market mechanism to set a carbon price, with appropriate adjustment mechanisms in it for families and industry. A Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme - a form of emissions trading scheme - is designed to have the following core principles alive within it: to have maximal effective coverage to ensure the greatest cost-effectiveness and fairness in spreading the burden of reducing emissions, to allow international linkages and opportunities emerging in the global carbon market, to support industries making the transition to a lower pollution future, to avoid carbon leakage from emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries and to assist householders - especially pensioners and those on low incomes - to adjust to the price of carbon.Last month the government entered into good faith negotiations with the opposition with the aim of securing the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme through the Senate this week. The deal that we have developed is consistent with our belief that a global agreement to stabilise levels at a CO2 equivalent of 450 parts per million would lie squarely within Australia's national interest. Furthermore, the deal would ensure that Australia could achieve its ambitious, unconditional target of a five per cent reduction or its conditional targets of up to 15 per cent and, at the top end, up to 25 per cent of 2000 levels by 2020 - if we are part of a global 450 parts per million agreement. In crafting this deal, the government has continued to listen closely to industry organisations, environmental organisations and our international partners as we seek to move towards a Copenhagen agreement. This is the government's plan. This is why the government has stepped forward and engaged in good faith negotiations with the opposition. We have done so because we believe that this is in the national interest. We have done so because the Australian people gave us that mandate at the last election. We have done so also mindful of the fact that those opposite - An incident having occurred in the gallery -  -  - Dog whistling usually comes later in question time when it comes to the questions asked by those opposite - or to use another analogy when it comes to whistling in the dark I can see a lot of that in the ranks of those opposite.The government has engaged in good faith negotiations with the opposition because we believe it is in the national interest to bring about a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We believe it is in the national interest for Australia - the hottest and driest continent on earth - to act. We believe that it is in our interest to act now. We have done so mindful of the fact that those opposite themselves took the proposal for an emissions trading scheme to the previous election. My appeal to all those opposite who are of goodwill is to get behind this scheme. Australia cannot wait another 10 years. Australia must get on with acting now and my appeal to all members opposite is to get behind, in a bipartisan spirit, this necessary national reform - the biggest reform for the environment that this country has seen in its history and also a substantial and significant reform for our economy. I appeal to those opposite to stand with the government in the national interest.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the great thing about the -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the honourable member for her question and also, for the interjection on his part, the member for New England as he reminds us that in fact there is an unresolved question before the parliament. Again, it is surprising that some 30 days have elapsed, I believe, since we have had any question in this place on climate change. The honourable member asks a question about preparations on Christmas Island and I am sad that she did not follow completely the immediate aftermath of the whistling performance which was given from the press gallery. It should have been better synchronised with the dog whistling in which she proposes to engage. 
Opposition members - Oh! - Oh, the public gallery. My apologies to the press gallery. Can I say, in response to the honourable member's question, that presumably the Howard government built the Christmas Island detention facility at a time at which they were claiming, having built an 800- or 900-bed facility, that their policies were so successful that such a facility would not be needed in the future. Why on earth did they build it? Was it simply a flight of fancy? Was it simply because it might come in handy one day? Was it because some of the hardheads in the department of immigration thought, 'Maybe one day what will happen is that we'll have, because of security circumstances around the region and around the world, a need to have such a facility in preparation'? That is precisely the purpose for which the immigration authorities built the facility and the purpose to which we are putting it at present.The other part of the honourable member's question goes to practical measures. Can I say this to the honourable member in response to her question. When it comes to practical measures to deal with the challenges of asylum seekers and people smuggling, first and foremost I draw attention to the fact that in the last 12 months what we have seen is some 61 arrests of people smugglers, some 23 convictions of people smugglers and we have some 37 people smugglers of one category or another currently before the courts. Can I also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that, as far as disruptions of people-smuggling ventures are concerned, in the last 12 months - or at least since September 2008 - we have had some 89 disruptions involving our friends and partners in Indonesia involving some 2,221 individuals and some 28 arrests. She asks further about practical measures. With the government of Malaysia we have so far engaged with 15 separate disruptions involving some 552 people and some six arrests. Also, in the case of Sri Lanka we have so far had some 12 separate disruptions involving 110 people and 18 arrests. Those opposite ask: what practical measures are you taking to deal with the challenge of people smuggling? I would suggest to those opposite that these actually constitute practical measures, because they are working with our friends and partners in the region to disrupt a significant people-smuggling operation right across our wider region. That is one arm of cooperation. The other is, of course, dealing with the challenges in source countries themselves. When it comes to dealing with source countries, those opposite would be familiar with the particular challenges we face in Sri Lanka. That is why the foreign minister, again as a practical course of action, in partnership with the World Bank and other international institutions, is working with the Sri Lankan authorities to assist with the resettlement of those who have been internally displaced within Sri Lanka back to their original place of domicile. Some 260,000 people have been dislodged. The challenge, therefore, in providing accommodation for those who need to be relocated is huge. That is why we are working with the IOM and other international organisations, including the World Bank.Finally, I would say this to those opposite, and I go back to what I was saying before about the sheer numbers involved in this disturbance in Sri Lanka: 260,000 and 130,000 have gone across the water to India and you have some thousands and tens of thousands going to Europe, by one means or another, and into North America. The total number of arrivals in this country so far from Sri Lanka: some 600 to 700.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. Could I also congratulate him on the joint parliamentary committee report that came down last night, which really goes to the core of future economic reform particularly in financial services. The government will look at all of those recommendations and take them very seriously, because, as a government, we take long-term reform very seriously. Long-term reform is never easy. Opening up our financial system in the eighties was never easy. Introducing compulsory superannuation was never easy. Tearing down the tariff wall was never easy. But all of these long-term reforms that were put in place by far-sighted governments of the past are one of the reasons why we are such a prosperous nation today and among some of the reasons why we have done so well during this global recession, because far-sighted governments and political parties committed to long-term reform took the hard decisions at the right time. They did not delay. They did not take the easy course of action.Of course, nothing is harder - and this is the case - than introducing a carbon pollution reduction scheme, but it is an essential reform for our future prosperity and an essential reform if we want to leave a legacy of prosperity to our children not just in terms of our economy but in terms of our environmental sustainability. This is a challenge that we cannot afford to shirk as a nation, and the government has been working very hard in this area over a long period of time. We made a commitment to the people at the last election. We have brought down a green paper; we have brought down a white paper; we have brought down legislation. We are very serious about long-term reform because we are serious about what we hand to subsequent generations with regard to a prosperous economy and a sustainable environment. That is what is at stake in the debate about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.In essence, it is about jobs and it is about protecting our economy from the consequences of dangerous climate change. The government has come to this after it has done an enormous amount of work. We have had an enormous amount of work done by the Treasury: comprehensive modelling that the world looks at as being one of the most important responses that has been put in place by any nation around the globe. What does it tell us, because this is what should inform us about how we act if we are going to act in the long-term national interest? This is what the modelling shows us. It shows we can have continued economic growth while we reduce carbon pollution. It is a path that delivers continued increases in employment, with 1.7 million new jobs to 2020, while we reduce carbon pollution. It is a path that delivers continued increases in average income. Expect it to grow by $4,300 per person to 2020 while we reduce carbon pollution.But critically, and this goes very much to the here and now, what we must deliver is certainty to business so that it can invest in new green technologies and new industries. This is the way forward. This is the path to the future, which is why the government has come to the table with good faith and negotiated with some opposite to put in place a scheme which is sustainable, economically responsible and environmentally credible. That is what we have done. The bottom line is that as an economy, let alone a society, we cannot continue to put this problem in the too-hard basket. It has been there for far too long. Too many people over a long period of time have taken the short-sighted approach. Perhaps it is the politically popular approach, but it is the short-sighted approach. Hard reform is never easy, and we have to take it on. If we have inaction for longer, it will get harder and harder. The longer we delay the more it costs the nation, the greater the burden we deliver to our children and our grandchildren, and the greater the cost to the economy. That is what all of the modelling shows.It is what common sense shows as well. It is what common sense tells you: the longer you delay taking action, a fundamental action, the greater the cost that comes to you and the community in which you live. So for that reason we have moved forward in a practical way. We know that the cost of not acting now is far higher in the long term. And if we do not act now, we are sentencing the Australian economy to a very sharp and dangerous shock at some stage in the future. That is the problem, and that is why we need to act. That is why we have spent two years working on a carbon pollution reduction scheme.It is about time this parliament acted. It is about time everyone here put the national interest ahead of their self-interest. It is our turn to put the Australian economy on the right path by passing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question, and I go to the Ronaldson doctrine, which says, 'Make sure you pursue stories which take into account special interest groups getting undeserved handouts.' The Ronaldson doctrine then says:You don't get news stories by trying to change perceptions, you get them by reinforcing stereotypes. - Mr Speaker, I am always taken by the sensitivity with which they respond to the Ronaldson doctrine when it is rendered here. I would have thought, when it was emailed out from the office of the Leader of the Opposition, and coming from Senator Ronaldson's senior staffer, that they would all own it with pride. - The question was asked about mobile team visits. I draw this to the member for Curtin's attention. Mobile team visits have been in operation since 2003. Furthermore, mobile team visits have so far been conducted in the following locations - a number of these were under the previous government - in Beirut, in Nairobi, in Pretoria, in Cairo, in Bangkok and in Jakarta. Furthermore, for the information of the honourable member, there were 14 MTVs, as they are called, conducted in 2005-06 in Beirut, Nairobi, Pretoria, Cairo and Bangkok; 12 in 2006-07; 11 in 2007-08; five in 2008-09; and six so far in the 2009-10 period.

 - Thank you to the member for Bonner for her question. Today the government is on the cusp of delivering one of the most significant economic and environmental reforms in this country's history because - if the deal that is presently before the opposition is agreed to - the CPRS will, for the first time in our economy, place a price on carbon pollution. This will enable Australia to start the very important work of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. It will also drive investment in abatement and low emissions technologies. To protect jobs and smooth the transition to a low carbon economy, the deal before the opposition enhances transitional assistance for industry and jobs. A key element of the deal is that, in relation to the coal industry, the inclusion of coal mining in the scheme and it will contribute to the abatement effort overall in the economy. There is an enhanced $1.5 billion assistance package in the deal to protect jobs and assist the industry transition - $1.23 billion is in the form of free permits to the gaseous coalmines over the first five years of the scheme and there is also included a $270 million abatement fund to assist waste coalmine abatement.A further key element in relation to emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries is that there is enhanced assistance to emissions-intensive activities. These include permanently incorporating the global recession buffer, announced by the government on 4 May, into the assistance rates. Those rates will commence at 94½ per cent for the most emissions-intensive industries, and 66 per cent at the second tier. The proposed deal retains the annual 1.3 per cent carbon productivity contribution to ensure that emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries retain an incentive to reduce emissions. There is also assistance to be reviewed regarding any new global agreement and evidence of comparable efforts by trade competitors.Importantly, this deal also strengthens environmental outcomes, including through measures to further encourage and account for voluntary action and through a new energy efficiency mechanism to be developed next year, with input from a new prime ministerial task group on energy efficiency. The deal also creates a new green carbon fund to build resilience for natural ecosystems under threat from climate change and there is also a commitment that the IPCC advice on mitigation is taken into account when setting scheme caps and gateways. The deal also retains assistance to households for increases in costs of living associated with the introduction of the CPRS.If passed this legislation will, as the Prime Minister said earlier, be a very significant milestone in our economic history and also a milestone in environmental reform. Since coming into power, the government has taken very strong action to meet the challenge of climate change. We have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, introduced the renewable energy target, committed to significant reduction targets and made the largest ever investment in energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage, and solar technologies. The CPRS is the key plank of our action against climate change. Labor is extremely committed to this important reform and to acting in the national interest. It is now up to the opposition to vote in the national interest, support the deal and support the passage of the CPRS legislation this week.</DOC>

 - It is good to see that Ronno's doctrine is still at work. You do not get news stories by trying to change perceptions, you get them by reinforcing stereotypes - and stereotype 101 has just been at the despatch box. -  - Well those opposite circulated the Ronaldson doctrine on stereotypes - we did not. It was prepared by a senior staffer in Ronaldson's office and circulated from the office to the Leader of the Opposition. - Perhaps after question time the member for Canning will have just a little reflection on his comments over the years. In response to the question, Christmas Island capacity is as I have described to the House before. Furthermore, can I say to the honourable member that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has made suitable statements on the requirement for additional capacity. Regarding any reserve capacity beyond that he has also commented that that will be in hand. It is practical and prudent to do this, in dealing with what has been a surge in activity, particularly coming out of Sri Lanka because of civil disturbances in that country.</DOC>

 - The government does face a very substantial challenge to return the budget to surplus after the impact of the global financial crisis and global recession on the budget, particularly with a dramatic drop in projected taxation revenue. The recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers did modify the projections in a positive way with respect to future deficits and projected debt but, nonetheless, we are still facing the prospect of debt peaking at around 10 per cent of GDP and at around $150 billion or so in net terms, which is still extraordinarily low in global developed world terms but does require serious discipline on the part of the government in order to get the budget back to surplus - at least by 2015-16, as projected in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers. We have set in place a couple of disciplines to ensure that that will occur - in particular, offsetting all new spending with savings and also placing a cap of two per cent in real terms on increases in spending once ordinary trend levels of growth have resumed.Mr Speaker, like everybody in this House, you would be aware that we have received a great deal of advice and free character assessment from the opposition in recent times about the importance of getting the budget back into surplus and about the levels of debt and deficit. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition does not always follow his own advice on these matters. We have had a number of budget initiatives that have been blocked in the Senate - budget initiatives involving billions of dollars worth of savings - such as the private health insurance rebate reforms, the reforms to the scheduled benefit for cataract surgery and also reforms to youth allowance.You can imagine, Mr Speaker, that, given my responsibility, I approached the prospect of negotiations with respect to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme with some degree of trepidation given some of the initial claims being put forward by the opposition. But I am very pleased to say that the proposals that have been negotiated between the government and the opposition have only a very, very modest impact on the budget over the forthcoming 10 years. In fact, the total impact in net terms is a deterioration of somewhere slightly higher than $750 million over 10 years. I think that augurs well that we may be seeing a slight change of heart on the part of the opposition on these matters, and I look forward to that being reflected in some other contributions that they make. I commend the opposition for their constructive approach in these negotiations. It is certainly very important that we maintain the integrity of the budget position in this regard and, given the position that the opposition have taken on those issues in recent months and given that they hold significant power over these matters in the Senate, it is certainly very important that they practise what they preach.I could say more, but I am conscious of the fact that some members are part way through a very important meeting and they have to get away from question time soon in order to resume. I do not wish to add anything further on that point, but I would urge the opposition to complete the process, join with the government in a bipartisan way to get through what is a very difficult and challenging issue and support the amended Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme proposal as negotiated between the government and the opposition.</DOC>

 - It has been, I think, more than 100 days since we have had a question on jobs. I notice that, even in this breaking of Joe's duck for the last several weeks, there is still no question on jobs. Can I say in response to the honourable member's question that what is appropriate and what is conservative in dealing with a global economic crisis is this: for the government to expand its own role and the economy when the private sector is in retreat and for the government to withdraw its activity once the private sector recovers. That is why the honourable member will be familiar with the fact that the government's national stimulus strategy was purposely designed to peak when the economy was at its weakest and then tail off. In fact, I am advised that the government's stimulus strategy, and the payments associated with it, peaked in the second quarter of 2009. That is because we are through the initial set of payments to pensioners, carers and low-income families. Secondly, we are now in the process of the medium-term infrastructure build - Building the Education Revolution, the insulation package for people's houses as well as the public housing investment - before we move into stage 3, which is the longer term infrastructure build. That is how it is designed - to deal with weaknesses in the economy now and build the infrastructure we need for the long term. If the honourable member is asking for the definition of what constitutes an economically conservative response to what has been the grossest assault on the Australian economy by the global economy in 75 years -  - The member for North Sydney interjects. If he looks at the data produced by the International Monetary Fund he will see that 2009 is the first time since 1951 that the world economy has contracted. - He says, 'Oh, it's the Australian economy.' Is the shadow Treasurer suggesting that Australia is unaffected by movements in the global economy? Is the alternative Treasurer of Australia seriously suggesting that, given our exposure to (a) global financial markets and (b) global export markets, the level of growth in the global economy does not materially affect growth and jobs in this economy?This government is unapologetic about stepping up to the plate to defend Australian jobs. Had we taken the advice of those opposite, what would have happened? We would have hundreds of thousands more Australians out of work. The result of our action is this: we now have the second-lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies. As a result of our actions and the actions of the Australian business community, Australia is the only economy of the major advanced economies not to have gone into recession. It is the only economy of the 33 economies in the OECD to have grown positively in the 2009-10 financial year. On top of that, we have registered the lowest debt and the lowest deficit. I regard that as a reasonable record of achievement so far, with much more to be done. - Yes. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know she has a strong interest in effective climate change action not only here in Australia but also in our neighbourhood. The fact is that our neighbours in South-East Asia and the Pacific are highly vulnerable to climate change, of course through sea level rise and having many people living in coastal communities, but there are also expected impacts of higher temperatures, ocean acidification, extreme weather, different ocean currents and the like. This is particularly important where many people rely on the ocean for their food security and their livelihood.I am asked what actions the government is taking to support Australia's near neighbours. We are taking a range of activities to help: a $20 million Pacific Climate Change Science Program, for example, helping Pacific island countries and East Timor better understand how climate change will impact on them. We have also allocated $25 million to help implement adaptation programs in Pacific island countries, improving coastal zone management and disaster preparedness. As well as that, Australia is a development partner for the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security. I was pleased to attend the second ministerial meeting of the Coral Triangle Initiative in the Solomon Islands last week. The Coral Triangle, an area of global environmental significance bordering Timor Leste, the Philippines, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, has the greatest marine biological diversity on the planet. It includes the Solomons as well. Some call it 'the Amazon of the oceans'. The Coral Triangle meeting was looking at ways of building the resilience of marine environments so as to better withstand the impacts of climate change. Australia has been pleased to support the efforts of the Coral Triangle Initiative, particularly providing expertise for them to develop and deliver plans of action, especially in terms of coral reef management, which for Australia, given our experience on the Great Barrier Reef, is a great asset.I am pleased to say that last week again I saw the strong commitment from the six Coral Triangle Initiative nations. They know that the problems that they face are important and they do want to take pronounced action to deal with them. This follows the Coral Triangle declaration, which was signed in Manado in Indonesia in May this year. There we had the presidents of the six Coral Triangle Initiative countries - President Yudhoyono, President Arroyo, Prime Minister Sikua, President Ramos Horta, Prime Minister Somare and Prime Minister Razak - standing side-by-side and agreeing to work together in the interests of their region and in the interests of the planet.Today the government is delivering the most significant economic reform in a generation and the most significant environmental reform in our history to deal with the impacts of climate change. Like the leaders of the Coral Triangle Initiative, we are acting in the national interest to protect the future for our children. We have done this because we know, as do they, that a healthy and productive environment is absolutely fundamental to our social and economic future. Addressing the impacts of climate change is critical to the long-term sustainability of populations in our region, as it is to Australia's interests as well. As the leaders of the Coral Triangle Initiative show that leadership, so it is time for the opposition to recognise the national interest that is at stake. We now need to move comprehensively and decisively on dealing with climate change. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that is in front of the parliament will assist this nation greatly in doing that and the time for leadership is now.</DOC>

 - Here we have the National Party campaigning against the rollout of infrastructure across the nation - the rolling out of roads across National Party electorates, the rolling out of rail infrastructure across the nation, the enhancement of ports across the nation, the building of schools in each and every National Party electorate contained within this parliament. I really wonder what planet the National Party sometimes lives on because it is completely detached from what their constituents are saying.Buried within that question from the Leader of the National Party is the following: that the expenditure currently going to the building of schools in each and every National Party electorate represented in this parliament is not wanted. Is that what the Leader of the National Party is saying? Is that what the member for Wide Bay is saying? He does not want any funding for any school in his electorate? He is hiding in his papers. Is that what he is saying? Is there anyone over there from the National Party interested in funding for their schools? I ask myself why is it that my good friend and colleague here, the Minister for Infrastructure - a term which was missing from the vocabulary of those opposite for their 12 years in office - constantly gets representations from National Party members about more to be done. I am looking at the Minister for Education - truckloads of correspondence; is there any from National Party members? - There are truckloads. How can you just stand at the despatch box and say 'It is a terrible waste to invest in this infrastructure' on the one hand and then on the other write to the ministers responsible and say 'Give us more.'? I do not understand. How do you get away with this? How do you square up when you try to do this? The member for New England is appropriately gesticulating. There is a certain detachment from reality on the part of the National Party. - Oh, Bruce. All those members over there: Kay, Bruce, all the others; all of that. You are not saying you do not want that money for your schools in Maranoa? Bruce, do you want money for your schools in Maranoa? - Do you want any money for schools in Maranoa. 
A government member - He wants more! - He wants some more. Come on Kay, over there in the Riverina; do you want some money for your schools? - So we have got Kay, we have got Bruce -  - Thank you Mr Speaker. Let us just leave schools for a moment and go on to roads for a bit, including a road very close to the electorate of the member for Wide Bay - the Cooroy to Kurra road, known very well to me, as I grew up in that part of the world, and to the Treasurer - the road which the Leader of the Nationals himself has described in its current state of repair as 'something like the worst road in Australia'. - You have not said that? I think he might have said that. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I hear an interjection from one of our colleagues from Western Australia about infrastructure. Before I go back to the Cooroy to Kurra road, is it the WA Liberal government which is now partnering with us in an infrastructure development at Oakajee? Is it the WA Liberal government which is partnering with us in an expansion of the Ord? Is it the WA government which is partnering with the Australian government in the inner city rail bridge at Northbridge? I think in all three of those cases the answer is yes. And a WA member rises in sensitivity! - The question asked by the -  - When it comes to the member for Mallee, should I mention the Horsham Town Hall? That is something which the member for Mallee has been keen to receive investment in, through the agency of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, in order to assist with that project of, I believe, some millions - a project whose opening, the launch of the project, I believe the honourable member was very happy to attend. The reason I raise this with the member for Mallee, other National Party members, the member for Canning, representing, as he does, the interests of the WA Liberals, and others who are here is to point to one central point on infrastructure investment. It is called hypocrisy. They are in here saying, 'Isn't this a terrible thing for the Australian government to be investing in the infrastructure needs of the nation and the regions and localities?' on the one hand, and in their electorates, in their constituencies, they are doing everything they can to roll it in at the same time.I conclude with the example which goes most directly to the local interests of the member for Wide Bay, who asked the question: the Cooroy to Curra road, a part of the Bruce Highway which has stood there for decades and decades and decades unattended to and which, according to the local ambulance officers - if I recall from the Treasurer - has been the source of untold tragedy and has therefore been the subject of multiple representations to the government about what we could do. It took this Australian Labor government to invest some $480 million - $630 million in partnership with the Queensland government - to attend to a road need in your area, something which you, when you were the local member and a minister for transport in the federal government, failed to do. - I would simply suggest that the member for Wide Bay, when he next asks a question about infrastructure, reflects on something as basic as this: if you are going to stand at the dispatch box and complain about something, how can you at the same time happily receive that investment back on your home turf? Can I just say it reeks of double standards, and that is what we have seen from the National Party from the beginning to the very end on this entire infrastructure program of the Australian government.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the question from the member for Bass, because, as the member for Groom and I appreciate, any strong economy is very much dependent on the reliability of the electricity system. I can also advise the House that it is a matter that has fully occupied the government and the opposition over the last month of detailed negotiations about potential revisions and refinements of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. In that context, I am pleased to advise the House of six key amendments to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that go to the endeavours by both the government and the opposition to make sure that, as we transition to a low-carbon economy, we have a fully operational, reliable electricity system. I can also say that, in the context of making the transition, reliability is required to bring on new investment, and the initial transition is going to be very much dependent on a growth in dependence on gas.The key refinements are therefore as follows. Firstly, the government will increase the assistance under the Electricity Sector Adjustment Scheme from 130.7 million permits to 228.7 million permits, a significant increase of 75 per cent. Secondly, the government will extend the period of the Electricity Sector Adjustment Scheme from five years to 10, meaning that generators will be required to comply with the power system reliability test over this period to continue to receive government assistance. Thirdly, the government will introduce a Low Emissions Transition Incentive by amending the power system reliability test further to allow generators to receive credit for their own investments in low-emissions replacement capacity. That is about reliability plus new investment for the purposes of the transition. Fourthly, the government will establish - and this is a very important proposal going to the issue of reliability and transition - an Energy Security Assurance Mechanism with an advisory board that will advise the government on whether there are any remaining low-probability systemic problems with respect to electricity market security and, if so, what further actions are necessary to address these risks. Fifthly, the government will delay the windfall gains test that applies to ESAS assistance to apply to the last three of 10 years of assistance and to only half of a generator's allocation in this period. Sixthly and finally, the government per the proposed agreement with the opposition, will provide a transitional measure to address the working capital costs of market participants and, in doing so, allow generators to defer payments for future year permits.I believe this package represents a coming together of people who understand the complexities of the electricity system and the huge challenge to maintain reliability during this transition. I say that because, without a reliable electricity system, you do not have a fully functioning economy and strong economic growth foundations for Australia. The outcome of these negotiations represents an endeavour by both parties to act in the national interest and, in doing so, to guarantee energy security, which is the key to protecting jobs and the economy from climate change.I can also advise the House that, on the finalisation of these measures, the secretary to the Department of Climate Change sought advice from the energy market institutions who have written to the secretary in support of the final arrangements as proposed in the CPRS document released this morning. These letters are available publicly. I refer, for example to comments by the Chairman of the Australian Energy Regulator, Mr Steve Edwell, who said there are 'low risks of energy shortfalls as a result of the introduction of the CPRS'. I can simply say in conclusion that that is a very important statement by the chairman of the Australian Energy Regulator because estimates of Australia's electricity infrastructure investment needs between now and 2020 are in the order of $100 billion in generation and network costs, including for renewables. This is an investment comparable to Australia's current asset base of $120 billion in power generation, transmission and distribution, so it represents a huge challenge in terms of the transition and the introduction of the CPRS.In terms of the energy market, the finalisation of a CPRS, side-by-side with a renewable energy target as previously approved by the parliament, potentially establishes, if approved by the Senate, a clear framework at long last in which to plan to meet that huge challenge on electricity investment so key to our economic future. - Yes, Mr Speaker. - It is confidential in nature.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Sturt for his question. The first thing I would say in response to the member for Sturt is to have a clear and close look at the Australian Education Agreement, which was signed between the Australian government and the states last year. I would say to the member for Sturt, who is not interested in any answer to the question he has just asked, that the Australian Education Agreement for schools represents a 50 per cent increase in Australian government investment in schools over the five-year period against the benchmark which we inherited from the previous government. That is the first point. The second is that, if the member for Sturt is actually interested in what we mean by quality education and quality education outcomes, he should study carefully the number of national partnership agreements which flow off that national education agreement and what therefore flows through in terms of the measurement of school performance. That is the second point. I could say to the honourable member that, if he is actually interested in real performance in schools, that is where his attention should go.On the question of quality education, one of the key elements of policy on quality education is this: the public production of reporting of school performance. That is a core part of education reform. But which party in Australia stands opposed to the production of that public reporting of data on school performance? Could it be the Australian Labor Party? No. Could it be even the National Party? No. It is not the Democrats, because they are not around anymore. Could it be the Greens? No, it is not them but I think they were party to it. The principal agent is the Liberal Party in the state of New South Wales. The Liberal Party, under Mr O'Farrell, in the New South Wales parliament has blocked the core element of education reform when it comes to public reporting. - He interjects and says, 'This is not a core element of reform.' He says that the public reporting of school performances is not a core element of reform. We have engineered this agreement with the states and territories. We have increased the investment in schools. We have said in response to that that we want to see public reporting of school performance. Other states around the country are implementing these reforms, except New South Wales - and the reason for that is the rank opportunism of the Liberal Party of New South Wales. They have teamed up with - wait for it - the Greens. They have teamed up with the Greens in order to block this key education reform in New South Wales. He asked the questions: where is our reform agenda? Where is the implementation of the reforms? I would suggest that the member for Sturt hops on the telephone, rings Barry O'Farrell and tries to unstitch this piece of absolute policy obstructionism being engineered by the Liberal Party of New South Wales.Finally, why is it they have suddenly dropped off their questions about Building the Education Revolution? - Oh, he asked one yesterday. When it comes to the construction program underway in schools, we had one about a school yesterday. But, basically, it has been about a month since we had anything on this. For the benefit of the House, through the Building the Education Revolution component of the government's nation building for recovery plan, 24,382 individual projects have been approved around schools across Australia. That is 9,526 schools across Australia - government and non-government - and in every state of the country. More than 20,000 of these projects are underway and 1,200 of these projects have been completed. What we experience as local members of parliament as we go to our local school communities is the absolute delight from local communities about having a library being built, having a multipurpose hall being built, having plans now in place for a new science centre being built and having plans in place for a new language centre being built. This is part of the bricks and mortar of Building the Education Revolution as well. He asks where the action lies. I would point him to the 20,000 projects currently underway across the country. Can I suggest that he simply gets real with his questions for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. Can I echo the words of the Treasurer: hard reform is not easy; it takes leadership, it takes discipline, it takes application. That is, of course, what the government is doing in the education revolution while we watch the Liberal Party seek to deny students scholarships next year. And when it comes to workplace relations, we are seeing reform vandalism take over the Liberal Party.It has been a holy grail of microeconomic reform in this country to have one workplace relations system for the private sector for decades - literally decades. It is supported by businesses and business organisations right around the country. In the words of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, they said:In the Australian context, the case for a single system being introduced in the early years of the 21st century is overwhelming.In the words of Business SA, they said:It is utter madness that we are a country of 22 million people with awards covering different people, different states and different situations.After years of dithering and delay, we are on the cusp of delivering this holy grail of microeconomic reform. We have an agreement with Queensland, with New South Wales, with Victoria, with Tasmania and with South Australia to introduce our Fair Work system as the universal system for the private sector. Indeed, states have legislated their companion referring legislation - Queensland has, Victoria has, Tasmania has, South Australia has. Businesses around the country - the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Mines and Metals Association - are screaming out for this reform to be completed and to complete it we need the federal companion piece of legislation to the state referrals to go through this parliament this year.What will happen if this piece of legislation does not go through this year? The state based referral bills will lapse. That will mean that, to build this again next year, we will need all of those parliaments to legislate again. I think we are all aware of the fragility of political systems, of the changes that elections and ministerial changes can bring. It is possible that we will never be able to put this together again if it is not completed this year. The Liberal Party are opposing this bill. You would think, on the cusp of a major microeconomic national reform, with those states having legislated, that you would get with the program and you would deliver this bill. You would assume, if you were going to seek to delay it or debate it, that you would have a very clear idea of what you were trying to achieve in doing so.In this parliament, the following is the situation. The shadow minister for workplace relations has not even sought a briefing on the bill but he is opposed to it. The shadow minister for workplace relations and the Liberal Party have indicated vaguely in the public domain that they intend to amend the bill but they have not provided the government with the amendments. Here is a piece of national reform, called for by business organisations around the country, being held up by the Liberal Party, for what? For some mysterious reason that they refuse to tell us even in the form of amendments, causing all of the chaos and uncertainty that we will see for employers next year.I would say to the Leader of the Opposition - and I acknowledge he is a man with a few things on his plate - when it comes to hard reform, when it comes to making a difference in this country for businesses, he should listen to the voices from ACCI, AMA and the NFF, who do not want small businesses next year to wake up in jurisdictional limbo, who do not want next year to be reliant on the anachronism and rigidities of state based awards but want to move to the simple modern award systems. If the Leader of the Opposition is in any doubt about the employer thirst for that, he should speak to the National Farmers Federation. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has a few things on his plate but he needs to get to grips with this because we need the Liberal Party to change its ridiculous opposition to this bill and deliver this profound microeconomic reform.There was a day in this country when the Liberal Party used to say it was the party of microeconomic reform. In those days, when they were led by a man called John Howard, John Howard frequently spoke about the need to deliver this major piece of reform, a uniform system of workplace relations for the private sector. The challenge is there for the Liberal Party: whether as a rabble in opposition they want to look like an absolute shadow of their former selves, embracing economic vandalism, or whether they want to do the right thing in the remaining days of this parliament and deliver this bill. We await the answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson, now that he has returned to his seat - in both senses - for the question. He raises a question about public hospitals. He raises a question about the AMA report. Obviously the member for Dickson did not see my comments at the time. I said, in response to the AMA report, that they had basically got it right - that is, there is a huge problem in the nation's public hospital system. Let us be up-front about it. Secondly, let us also talk about the fact that there is a problem with elective surgery waiting lists and there is a problem in the time that elapses before people receive attention at accident and emergency with respect to what are defined as clinically acceptable times. In each and every one of the consultations that the health minister and I have been participating in around the country, nearly 20 of which I have been in myself and about 70 or 80 of which have involved the minister and others, we have given a standard presentation on the fact that the waiting time for accident and emergency has not changed - based on our data - since the early part of this decade and that it is unacceptably high.The second thing we have said, when it comes to the time for elective surgery, is that the waiting time is unacceptably high as well. It is a standard part of our presentation and it is consistent with the data that is contained within the Bennett commission report. If the honourable member is seeking to infer somehow that we do not recognise there is a problem, can I say that he has not been studying what I or others have been saying in the public debate on this. - The question is one of solutions. Let us turn to solutions and how those opposite used their 12 years to solve the problem. In 2003 the Liberals ripped $1 billion from the public hospitals. That was solution No. 1. Solution No. 2: the Liberals left 2,300 older Australians languishing in hospital beds every night. Thirdly, under the Liberals the health workforce shortage affected 60 per cent of Australians. Fourthly, they capped GP training places at 600 per year. - Mr Speaker, the honourable member asked me a question about the AMA report into the state of the nation's hospitals. The state of the nation's hospitals as it exists did not mysteriously appear as a consequence of what has happened in the previous six months, 12 months or 18 months. In fact, it is the product of long-term non-investment in the public hospital system of Australia by the previous government. Let us be up-front about that. What do they have to say about the 650,000 Australians who were left on public dental care waiting lists as a result of the them scrapping the Commonwealth dental care program? That is exactly what we inherited: underfunding for the hospitals, money being ripped out, older Australians being left to languish in hospitals and preventing others from properly occupying those hospital beds for the purposes of elective surgery and other procedures, capping of the number of GP training places and 650,000 Australians on public dental waiting lists. They have the audacity to stand here in this parliament and claim that they have no responsibility for the state of the nation's hospitals, as identified in the AMA report - which the honourable member just referred to. Let us just get real about this debate and get real about what has been inherited here, as a set of historical problems.The honourable member asks what we are doing about these challenges. I draw his attention to the following. In November the health minister announced a $64 billion health and hospitals agreement, a 50 per cent increase on the Liberals' last healthcare agreement. That is what we are doing. Secondly, for the first time, we are investing $750 million to help take pressure off emergency departments. I ask this of the member for Dickson: how much did the previous government invest directly in seeking to take pressure off emergency departments? Nothing, not a dollar. How much did they invest when it came to bringing down elective surgery waiting times? Nothing. We have invested some $600 million. How much did they invest in subacute care beds? The answer is that I do not know, but we are investing $500 million. These are the practical measures that we have put into place so far, quite apart from the investment in GP superclinics - a $275 million investment - and quite apart from our increased attention to overall health workforce training requirements. That is simply stage 1 of what we have sought to do in the two years that we have been in office.We have also outlined through the Bennett commission of review what constitutes two overall strategic options for the long-term future. The time frame for considering those is as I outlined to the House yesterday in response to the honourable member's question. If he is going to ask questions about health and hospitals, let him not simply airbrush away the impact of 12 years of simple ignorance, non-attendance and non-investment in the hospital system of Australia. If you are going to raise questions about the hospital system, tell us what you have done in the past and tell us what you will do in the future. We have a plan to deal with both.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. As he knows, last night we had a very special evening for the annual National Disability Awards. The ceremony was held here in Parliament House. I would like to, first of all, thank all those members and senators - from both sides of the House - who joined us. I particularly thank both the Prime Minister and Therese Rein, the patron for the International Day of People with Disability, for coming along and participating with so many wonderful people who were celebrating the outstanding achievements of people with disability. The member for Bass was telling me just before question time that the night kicked on and people had a wonderful evening. We are very pleased that it was such a special night for all the people who were finalists in the awards. I want to particularly acknowledge the award winners - Sue Gordon, Robert Strike, Dudley Afford, Tina Zeleznik, Michael Taggart and Melissa Noonan, all people who have made extraordinary contributions.We also last night saluted Kurt Fearnley. I think we have all been following his extraordinary efforts as he crawled the entire 96 kilometres of the Kokoda Track. Those people in this House who have walked or struggled through - not me, but I know people on both sides of the House have done the walk - and know how hard it was for them can really not even imagine how difficult it must have been for Kurt, so it was wonderful to have him there last night. He, of course, like the award winners, is an extraordinary Australian and has achieved extraordinary things.One of the important matters for us to all think about on a night like last night is that, for many people with a disability, living an ordinary life is still a very, very stiff uphill battle. For far too many people with a disability they face a badly disconnected service system. Even though we have made a start to increase the funding for services to people with a disability, we know that we have a long way to go. We have in fact doubled the funding to the states and territories under the National Disability Agreement. Just so people are aware of the figures, by 2013 that means that the Australian government's contribution will exceed $1.2 billion to this agreement. That compares to $620 million delivered in 2007 under the previous government.That said, of course, even with that significant increase in funding, we do know that there is a lot more to be done. There is going to be a very significant increase in the number of people with severe disability. It is why people with disability were so pleased last night when the Prime Minister announced that the Productivity Commission will conduct an inquiry into the feasibility of a long-term national care and support scheme. This has been something which a number of people have campaigned for for a long time to address what are significant unmet needs for people with disability and their carers.The Productivity Commission will look at the costs, the benefits and the feasibility of approaches which provide essential care and support on an entitlement basis for people with severe disability. It will look at a very new approach for Australia, and that is a social insurance model, as well as looking at other models. There will be an associate commissioner appointed and an independent panel with specialist disability expertise. They will support the review and also make sure that people with disabilities and their carers will have input into the review. We expect the commission to report back by July 2011.We certainly do understand just how complex this area of policy is, but I do want to pay particular regard to the work by the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, Bill Shorten, who has been an outstanding advocate for people with a disability. He has done an enormous amount of work in this area of policy, which has been far too long ignored by those opposite -  -  - who are now interjecting. They ought to recognise that people like Bill Shorten are out there doing the job rather than making smart remarks across the chamber. What we want to do is deliver for people with a disability. I thank the Prime Minister and the parliamentary secretary and everyone on this side of the House who has campaigned so long for this reform.</DOC>

 - The member for Paterson asked a question and in it he referred to those who were victims of 'slip and fall', as if this was not a category of injury about which this parliament should be concerned. I would strongly suggest that the honourable member seek to change those words later in question time, because I think the honourable member needs to reflect long and hard on the tens and hundreds of thousands of Australians who are looking very carefully at the need for assistance in the categories that we spoke about in the answer just given by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in question time today. This is a very difficult area of long-term reform. The social insurance model that she has referred to in her question, in terms of long-term disability reform, has now been the subject of a reference specifically to the Productivity Commission -  - I would say to the honourable member who has just interjected that the member for Paterson specifically asked me to contrast two possible schemes. - The honourable member asked about the contents of a private member's bill which was put to the parliament yesterday. Against that inquiry, which I foreshadowed last night at the National Disability Awards and which was referred to in question time today by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, I say again strongly to the member for Paterson that when he refers to slip and fall cases in the way in which he has he should think very long and hard about the number of Australians who find themselves subject to significant impairment and disability. - The slip and fall cases to which the honourable member for Paterson has referred warrant the most serious consideration by the parliament and by the government, and that is why we have provided an explicit reference to the Productivity Commission on the future form of any possible social insurance scheme which would deal with the many, many, many Australians who find themselves in those circumstances. - Yesterday after the honourable members introduced their private member's bill the honourable member for Warringah, having asked me a question about it in the chamber, brought around to my office two individuals who had been victims of one of the Bali bombings and asked if I would meet them. He did so without giving any notice, and I would not have expected him to give any notice. I was of course delighted to come out and meet them and spend some time talking to them. Furthermore, I had no prior notice, as I said yesterday, about the proposed introduction of the bill to which the honourable members have referred, but I understand that the honourable member's bill seeks to provide a payment of $75,000 for those who fall victim to international terrorist attacks. At this stage it is difficult for the government to foreshadow what the Productivity Commission may or may not recommend as being appropriate for all categories of disability and impairment which would flow from the scheme which has been the subject of the reference to the PC. Therefore, it is important that we await the PC's conclusions.It was only yesterday in this parliament that the honourable members introduced a private member's bill. An hour later the honourable member brought around to me two individuals who had been affected directly by one of these bombings and I made a point of going out almost immediately to meet with them. On top of that, reflecting directly upon the conversation we had with those individuals - and I made reference to those individuals in the speech I gave last night at the National Disability Awards - I would say that for individuals such as those persons we should also consider how and by what means any future social insurance scheme of the type which has been referred to by the families minister in question time today could address those and other needs.On top of that, as I said yesterday in question time in response to the member for Warringah, we maintain an open mind as to what forms of practical assistance we can provide to Australians who are victims of international terrorist attacks. That is the spirit which the government brings to bear in seeking to deal with this sensitive set of problems, as we are seeking to deal with other sensitive problems concerning those who have suffered comprehensive disability and other forms of disability.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He makes reference specifically to Sri Lanka in his question, and of course a range of measures arise from that in our cooperation with Sri Lanka as a source country for those who are seeking to go to other parts of the world because of the civil disturbances in that country earlier this year - in fact, a very bloody civil war which has seen some 260,000 people internally displaced within that country, 130,000 having gone to India, many thousands having sought to go and successfully gone to France and Germany as well as to Canada and the United States, and so far some 600 or so having come to Australia.On the question of Sri Lanka, I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that as a product of our cooperation with the Sri Lankan government and in consultation with the Sri Lankan authorities, we have been assisted in interrupting people-smuggling ventures between Sri Lanka and Australia and between Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Yesterday I informed the House of the general number of interruptions which have occurred with the Indonesians, the Malaysians and the Sri Lankans. Of course honourable members would be aware of reports that on 23 and 24 November Sri Lankan authorities located and intercepted four people-smuggling ventures off the coast of Sri Lanka that were believed to be headed in this direction.We will continue to work closely with the Sri Lankan authorities, as all responsible governments of Australia would do. On the question of the conditions within Sri Lanka I would also draw the honourable member's attention to the work being done by our special representative, John McCarthy, formerly High Commissioner to India, who is working with the Sri Lankan authorities both on people-smuggling cooperation and on internally displaced persons and resettlement and reconstruction. Also, what we have done with the Sri Lankan government, based on the recent visit to Colombo by the Foreign Minister, is to confirm our continued cooperation with the Sri Lankans to assist with their humanitarian and resettlement challenges, including providing more than $35 million in development assistance to Sri Lanka this financial year, $5 million to support the resettlement of internally displaced persons and $2.3 million for de-mining the former conflict areas. This is particularly important given the heavy use of landmines in the area, which is of concern in the resettlement process, and given the number of landmines used in the civil war against the LTTE.Our continued cooperation with Sri Lanka is important. It is part of a comprehensive response to the global challenge of people-smuggling with the Sri Lankans, with the Malaysians and with the Indonesians and, of course, provides proper support and investment for our customs protection and border security forces who are at work in the air and on the sea at present in dealing with a challenge not just for this country but for the entire region and for the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. Indeed, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme has been the subject of some discussion and debate in recent days on both sides of the House. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, if you drill into its absolute essentials, is about reducing carbon pollution, it is about helping families with the adjustment costs arising from a higher price of carbon, it is about helping industries adjust, it is about boosting green jobs for the future and it is about helping cool the planet. That is why we are engaged in this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.The Department of Climate Change and Water forecasts that Australia's domestic emissions will peak between 2011 and 2013. For the first time in our nation's history Australia would then be producing less carbon each year. This is something of which every Australian could and should be proud. Furthermore, it is forecast that by 2020 the government's climate change measures will have reduced carbon pollution in Australia by 138 megatons below the business as usual baseline. Again, this is something of which all Australians should be proud. On top of that, if you translate that into a motor vehicle equivalent, the numbers are quite stunning. It is equivalent to reducing Australia's carbon pollution by taking 35 million cars off the road. That is approximately twice the size of the entire Australian motor vehicle fleet. This, again, is something of which all Australians should be proud.Treasury modelling also has provided us with advice about the impact we will face across the Australian economy as a consequence of this action through the CPRS, particularly in relation to the further growth of the renewable energy sector. Treasury modelling projects that by 2050 the Australian renewable energy electricity sector will be 30 times as large as it is today. This is what we call green jobs for the future.The Climate Institute study shows that $31 million of clean energy projects are already underway or planned in response to the government's climate change policies. Again, this is good news for green jobs and for the economy. These investments are expected to generate around 26,000 new jobs, many of them in regional Australia. So these are good developments when it comes to the overall economic impact of introducing a carbon pollution reduction scheme as well.Beyond that, for the business community, an important consequence flows from the agreement reached between the government and the opposition on the passage of this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme through the Senate. The agreement reached with the opposition yesterday will result in the CPRS now providing business with the certainty to make investments in the future. This is what business has been calling for for a long, long time. I would quote what the head of the BCA has had to say about this only in the last day or so. Graham Bradley, the BCA President, said:When passed, the legislation will enable Australian businesses to plan for and make the required decisions about investments to transition Australia to a low-emissions economy in the future.This is important certainty for the Australian business community.The other thing which we need to be very mindful of in this debate is the cost of inaction. We have spoken just now of the consequences of acting, after 12 years, through this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, an emissions trading scheme for the future. The costs of inaction also need to be registered for all those who are mindfully engaged in this debate. First of all, we need to be very clear about the fact of what would happen to the Australian economy were we to see inaction nationally and globally. The Stern review has concluded that, if we fail to act, the overall costs of climate change will be equivalent to losing between five and 20 per cent of global GDP each year, now and into the future. Put that into Australian terms - what would that translate to? A cost of between 2½ thousand dollars and $10,000, in today's dollars, for every Australian every year. These are significant costs, and that is before we go to the regional costs, both economic and environmental.The recent Oxford Economics report commissioned by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation finds that climate change related coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef may cost $37.7 billion in lost economic value. Furthermore, the Great Barrier Reef alone attracts some two million tourists each year, supporting tourism across the region and generating over $4.9 billion in tourism and employment for around 60,000 people, something for which I know the member for Leichhardt and other members from Queensland are deeply concerned. Without action on climate change, the Garnaut review showed, by 2030 the value of agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin would shrink by 12 per cent, and by 49 per cent by 2050. That is why it is essential that we act on climate change also to support the future of agricultural production in our country. More than 90,000 people are employed in agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin. Their jobs are important, like the jobs of all Australians, those jobs also which are being generated from tourism on the Barrier Reef and those jobs which can be generated by a new, clean, green renewable energy sector as well.Finally, on cost, can I say this: let none of us underestimate the costs which flow from the increased incidence of extreme weather events which come as a consequence of climate change - whether it is heat waves, drought, hail storms, tropical cyclones or fires. The serious consequences in terms of the human costs and the serious consequence in terms of the cost of insurance: these constitute the costs of inaction, and they are as much a part of the debate as the adjustment costs associated with action. Therefore, this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is on about the business of reducing carbon pollution in Australia. It is about helping cool the planet. It is about how we help our families adjust to higher carbon costs in the future, how we help our industries adjust to higher carbon costs in the future and how we generate the green jobs of the future. I would thank the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition for supporting this legislation in its passage through the parliament. We believe this is legislation in the Australian national interest and in the interests of our kids, our grandkids and the future economy.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition on people smuggling because I have some further information for the House today. This is a statement just released by the Australian Federal Police. It says:Two Indonesian men have been charged with the people-smuggling offences after the alleged attempt to facilitate the arrival of 52 people in Australia. The 32-year-old man and 18-year-old man will appear in Perth Magistrates Court today.The Australian Federal Police charged the men with one count of facilitating the bringing of noncitizens into Australia, of five or more people, contrary to section 232A of the Migration Act 1958.The men arrived on 9 October 2009 on a vessel that was intercepted by the Royal Australian Navy. The two Indonesian men bring the total number of people charged by the AFP with people-smuggling offences since September 2008 to 63.Therefore, on the question of people smuggling I would simply point to the practical action being engaged in now by our border protection authorities and by our Australian Federal Police.Can I also therefore on the broader question of action on people smuggling, given that that is the question which has been asked me, refer the Leader of the Opposition also to the 63 arrests so far, the 23 convictions and the 37 who are currently before the courts. He asks also in terms of the effectiveness of government action in relation to people-smuggling activities. I referred before to the disruptions currently being engineered by elements of the Sri Lankan security forces. I would draw to his attention the numbers which apply to other countries in the last 12 months: with the Indonesians, some 89 disruptions involving some 2,221 people, resulting in 28 arrests; with Malaysia, some 15 disruptions involving 552 people, resulting in six arrests; and prior to the news that I gave the House this morning about Sri Lanka, some 15 disruptions already, involving some 260 individuals. These are the practical actions in which we are engaged.The Leader of the Opposition referred also to the number of vessels. I would refer to the historical record of the Howard government on these questions, and that is that, compared to 2009, which he referred to, I believe, in which some 45 vessels have so far come to Australia, in 2001 there were 44 vessels, in 2000 there were 51 vessels and in 1999 there were 86 vessels. In the year 2001 there were 5,516 individuals on those vessels.I say to those opposite that it would be very useful, if we engage in this debate about border security, which is an important debate for Australia, that first of all we understand what is happening globally - hence the answer I gave to an earlier question about what is happening around the world coming out of Sri Lanka - and, secondly, the regional cooperation with our partners in the region, the number of disruptions, the number of convictions, the number of arrests and those currently before the courts. Thirdly, we should also put into context what is happening now against what has happened in the past and the challenges which will continue to arise in the future. Because the facts are these: international people movements are fundamentally shaped by insecurity in the world. We saw this with the events of 2001 and 2003, and we have seen it in the events of 2005 and 2008, directly shaped by civil strife in Sri Lanka and deteriorating security circumstances in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Those are the overall factual circumstances which underpin the Leader of the Opposition's question.I would suggest, therefore, if we are serious about embracing these challenges for the future: let us get behind all of our border protection authorities, who are doing a fantastic job day in, day out, bringing these people smugglers to justice - for example, the two that I referred to, who have just been the subject of release by the Australian Federal Police. This is the sort of hardline approach we need with people smugglers. It is exactly the sort of approach this government has been implementing since we came to office and we will continue to do so in the future.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I think it is important to acknowledge those in the coalition who are supportive of action on climate change, because it is very important for the Australian economy and for our contribution to the battle against climate change and to achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions. However, as has been fairly evident over the last 24 to 48 hours, there are some fairly deep divisions on the other side of politics. We have seen some quite extraordinary scenes, including a struggle for leadership of the Liberal Party over this issue. It is important in this context that we consider some of the arguments that have been mounted against taking action on climate change and that we are clear about what some of these arguments actually involve.We have heard the argument that this might be some left-wing conspiracy - that the international climate scientists have been engaged in some form of conspiracy that will take us down some left-wing governance path. But an argument has also been advanced, by Lord Monckton, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher, that the international negotiations are in fact a conspiracy to establish world government. Lord Monckton has argued that a new global treaty on climate change would effectively mean that nation-states sign away their sovereignty to a new, United Nations world government. This has been seriously posited. Lord Monckton has argued that the aim is for the UN to have the power to directly intervene in the financial, economic, tax and environmental affairs of all nations that sign the global agreement. Lord Monckton, only about a month or so ago, I think it was, gave the following warning to American citizens:_ in the next few weeks, unless you stop it, your president will sign your freedom, your democracy, and your prosperity away forever.So Lord Monckton is positing a fairly serious conspiracy theory. This is a theory that climate change is a plot to destroy national sovereignty and to establish world government. That is essentially his argument.During the second reading debate on the CPRS legislation, there have been a few observations about this, and I will just briefly refer to a couple of the issues that have been raised. One contributor indicated that the draft treaty 'effectively gives complete power over the Australian economy to a committee of unelected UN carbon regulators'. Another contributor in the Senate had this to say:In cyber Australia right now there is a growing groundswell of disaffected people. I think probably up to a million people have been listening to Lord Monckton _One other contribution was:_ the aim of the Copenhagen draft treaty is to set up a sort of transnational government on a scale the world has never seen.Let us just have a look at this contention. What this is seriously arguing is that the majority of world leaders - people such as President Barack Obama; Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany; and Gordon Brown, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, amongst others - are in some form of international conspiracy to cede their national sovereignty and establish world government, presumably under the guidance of the UN, and that the vehicle for this great goal is the international negotiations for a treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions! This is the most bizarre, absurd, ridiculous contention that one could imagine being posited in this debate, and yet it gets an airing.After five weeks of negotiations in good faith, the government yesterday put to the coalition a deal on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and the Leader of the Opposition last night indicated that in his view it is good for jobs and it is good for the environment. The member for Groom, with whom of course Senator Wong and I have had considerable dealings in these negotiations, described the package as an exceptional package. It is a deal that the Business Council of Australia, the Aluminium Council, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Council of Social Service and many environment groups are supporting, and they are calling for its passage through the Senate.No major modern political party can be held captive by climate change sceptics and conspiracy theorists if it is to retain credibility. It is extremely important for this country that this week we get beyond these issues and ensure the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme through parliament. We need it to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we need it for the national interest and we need it to play a constructive role in international negotiations that will be about combating climate change, not about establishing some new, world government.</DOC>

 - I am advised that as at yesterday, as I understand it, there were 1,170 persons in the Christmas Island facility. The facility has capacity for 1,400 people currently but steps are in place to expand capabilities. In particular, 70 demountable buildings are in the process of being transported or erected - I am not currently sure of the precise location of those. They will be erected on land which occupies some 10 hectares, so there is plenty of land. As the Prime Minister has indicated, the Minister for Immigration has indicated what contingency plans would be available but the current efforts in place -  - The honourable member interjects as to whether that contingency plan would involve Darwin. The Minister for Immigration is on record as saying that that would be the contingency plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his very important question. Back in October 2008 and in February this year Australia faced a grave economic crisis which was forced on us by the global recession. In this parliament we acted decisively and joined with the community to put in place an economic stimulus to support jobs and small business - from the Cape right through to Tasmania, and from coast to coast. History records the fact that it was that stimulus that prevented this country from going into recession. We did this not with the help of the Liberal Party but despite the Liberal Party. They voted against our actions here in the House but thankfully on the second pass the Senate voted for the legislation. Australia was the beneficiary of that vote in the Senate, with lasting benefits for Australia. So many jobs were protected and so many small businesses were preserved, and there was no damage to the skills base or the capital base of our economy.Now, with just two more days of sittings, we face another moment whose significance is just as great. As the Prime Minister and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change were saying, the CPRS is absolutely vital to a prosperous Australia in a low carbon future. This point has been taken up today by the Business Council of Australia, which issued a media release entitled 'BCA Welcomes Bipartisan Support'. The release said:The introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) in Australia is of such fundamental importance and long-term consequences that it requires bipartisan support.It went on to say:When passed, the legislation will enable Australian businesses to plan for and make the required decisions about investments to transition Australia to a low emissions economy.The CPRS is absolutely critical to business certainty, to drive investment in new technologies and in green jobs and, as the Prime Minister pointed out before, to support new jobs - up to 30 times more in the future - in the green sector. That is very important.If the legislation passes it will send a strong message to all nations that plans for reform in this country have come through despite a global recession, because the temptation in other countries around the world - like it was for the Liberal Party here in February - could well be to do nothing. We need to send a strong message to the world and to everyone in this country that the government is absolutely focused on long-term reform to protect long-term prosperity. No country needs to send that message more than Australia because we are one of the hottest and driest continents. We are hit hardest and fastest by dangerous climate change. That is why we have had another statement today from business, from Heather Ridout, who said:If we do not put something on the table why should the rest of the world come in and help reduce emissions which will inevitably flow to Australia.This House, and of course the Senate, should seize this moment. We can work in the national interest together. Indeed, it is imperative that we do. We can send the message that Australia is up to this challenge because we have shown, through our response to the global recession, that we are up to the challenge of reform, we are up to the challenge of decisive action and we are up to the challenge of protecting our long-term economic interests.Now is the time for all sides of this parliament - for all parliamentarians in the House and in the Senate - to show some common purpose, to show that we will put our national interest first and to show that we understand the challenges of the future. Our responsibilities to our kids and to our grandkids are what we must follow and live up to. It is a test we cannot afford to fail.</DOC>

 - I do admire the member for Farrer's treatment of chronology! For the actual years that she is talking about, I do not have those figures in front of me - I just do not. But I do happen to have a few other figures for the years that she spoke about, because I thought she might ask this question, which has just been asked in the Senate, which is about arrivals by plane. Let me go to the years that she was just talking about. Total asylum seekers arriving - but we do not want that, do we? -  - I said in terms of the figures that the honourable member is in search of that I did not have them available to me. But what I do have available, because it has been a matter in the public debate and I have just been informed that it has been raised in the Senate, and obviously the member for Sturt is very sensitive about the thousands who came here -  - I can understand full well why the member for Sturt and others would be sensitive about this. In 2002 total asylum seekers arriving here from onshore, which means by means other than boat, were 5,875; in 2003, 4,439; in 2004, 3,213; in 2005, in 3,203; in 2006, 3,581; in 2007, 4,133 - and you will remember my earlier contribution to the debate about the increase globally of push factors affecting all countries - and in 2008, 4,936. You will see that in fact there has been a significant arrival in this country of asylum seekers by means other than boat, and that continued through the period from 2001 on.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his attendance at today's event here in Parliament House. I also thank the Leader of the Opposition for his attendance and other opposition members also for their participation. I think I saw the member for Groom there and other members from those opposite.White Ribbon Day is important because it is about one thing: how do we change Australian men's attitudes on violence towards women? That is what it is about. This is not a matter of partisan politics anywhere in this place. Measures were put in place by the previous government on this and we are seeking to continue those and to expand them into the future. That is because it is a core priority for the nation that we deal with the attitudes of men on violence towards women.In 2003, 10,000 white ribbons were distributed. Just three years later, in 2006, more than 300,000 white ribbons were distributed. And today hundreds of thousands of white ribbons will be worn by men and women across Australia because there are hundreds of thousands of Australians who are prepared to stand up against violence against women. Being a White Ribbon Ambassador is something I consider to be both a great honour and a great responsibility, and I believe I speak on behalf of all members of this place.Today the results of a survey commissioned by the Australian government on community attitudes to violence against women were released. The National Community Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women Survey 2009 surveyed more than 10,000 Australians, men and women in equal numbers, the first survey taken since 1995. The survey shows that there has been a significant shift in the attitudes and beliefs about violence against women held by Australians. The vast majority of Australians agree that relationships must be respectful and free of violence. But the survey also points to the challenges that we face, and also provides a strong evidence base for the next steps that we must undertake in reducing violence against women. The survey reveals that the two strongest predictors for holding violence-supportive attitudes are being male and having low levels of support for gender equity and equality. This demonstrates very abundantly the significance of White Ribbon Day and the role of White Ribbon Day ambassadors. It is our gender, the Australian male gender, that is responsible; no-one else. It is men who are responsible and we must show leadership in stamping this out in the future.The Australian government has committed to taking action against violence against women through the development of a national plan to reduce violence against women, to be released next year. Since the government has received the Time for action report prepared by the National Council to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children in April this year, the government has announced and acted on a $42 million package of immediate responses. This includes the Respectful Relationships program, the second round of which will be starting in schools and communities across the country in the new year.Action is being taken in communities across the country. A few years ago the Normanton Stingers Indigenous rugby league team started their own community campaign to reduce violence against women. Under the slogan 'Domestic violence - it's not our game' players and coaches agreed to be role models in the community by not engaging in family violence. If they broke this agreement they were banned from games and ultimately dropped from the team. The team joined the Imparja TV to run a local media campaign featuring players and that slogan. There has been a 55 per cent drop, I am advised, in reported cases of domestic violence in Normanton between 2006 and 2007. These are the sorts of practical measures which we are seeking to support across the country. There are many examples just like this where communities are taking the lead, are taking action to reduce violence against women.Violence against women will only be stopped by positive action by men and women around the country acting to stop that violence. I commend the work of the White Ribbon Foundation and the work of ambassadors right across the country. And I would encourage all men, all honourable men - in which category I place all male members of this House - around the country who have not yet done so to take the oath, to swear never to commit, never to excuse and never to remain silent about violence against women. I commend the Leader of the Opposition for having taken that oath earlier today; it is an oath I have taken earlier this year myself in Sydney. I commend the actions of all honourable members who took that oath today in the ceremony we attended, and I would encourage that action on the part of all male members of this parliament.</DOC>

 - My answer to the honourable member's question is no, I have not been provided with that information. But she is absolutely right to point out that the number of those seeking exit from countries like Afghanistan, Iraq and Sri Lanka went down in the period following 2001. It is a global phenomenon. I have been provided with further figures on arrivals preceding 2001 by means other than boat, because I think it is worthwhile pointing out to the House what happened before 2001. Arrivals in 2001 were 17,882, then it goes 15,547, 13,217 -  - As I said in response to the member for Farrer's question, obviously in that period - consistent with what happened around the world - the total number of exits from countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka went down. I have referred to those numbers in the House in the last few days. Why those opposite are so uncomfortable about this fact is that in the period they were in office, total arrivals of asylum seekers to Australia, including by air, was: 10,430 in 1996, 10,043 in 1997, 8,192 in 1998 and 13,217 in 1999. 
An opposition member - They fixed it! - The member up the back says they fixed it. Well if they fixed it in 2001, why did we have 5,875 arrive in 2002 and 4,439 in 2003?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question, because he knows that we do have to act responsibly and decisively to confront the reality of climate change. That is what we are preparing to do with our Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and we welcome the opposition's support for that scheme. We recognise that moving to a low carbon economy will have an impact both on individuals and on families. Putting a price on carbon will see some moderate increases in the prices of particular goods and services, and the government has always been upfront with the Australian people about these changes.As part of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, we will provide low- and middle-income households with compensation. That is a clear part of the scheme that is being proposed. Low-income households will be fully compensated to meet the expected average overall increase in the cost of living due to the CPRS. In particular, 90 per cent of low-income households will receive assistance in excess of 120 per cent of the average overall expected cost of living increase. It is also the case that middle-income households will receive assistance to help them with the increase in the cost of living. Half of all middle-income households will be fully compensated for the expected average overall cost of living increase. Around 97 per cent of middle-income households will receive some direct cash assistance. These are very important commitments we have made to low- and middle-income families and individuals to help them with the impact of the new carbon economy. The assistance package has today been welcomed by the Australian Council of Social Service. It says:ACOSS welcomes the government's commitment to provide cash compensation for low income households through the tax and payments systems to cover the expected energy price increases.To give people an idea of what this means in dollar terms for a family, a household with two children, earning $100,000, would be more than fully compensated. They would have an average cost impact of $976 and would receive compensation of $1,014 in 2012-13. These figures demonstrate the way the system will work. It will be the same for people who are on income support payments, for students and for the unemployed. They will receive an increase of 2½ per cent to their payments over two years, including upfront indexation, to help them with the introduction of the scheme. We will also see similar increases for pensioners, carers, veterans and people with a disability. Those people will receive an increase of $455 if they are single and $343 for each member of a couple. There will be increases to Family Tax Benefit parts A and B, increases to the low-income tax offset and to the dependency tax offset. All of these changes will make sure that low- and middle-income families and individuals will be helped as we move to a low carbon future.</DOC>

 - I think the honourable member would be familiar with the fact that the likes of Kevin Reynolds and various other celebrated individuals in that particular union do not necessarily hold either myself or others in this government in the highest regard. Going back to the expulsion of certain individuals from the Australian Labor Party, the news from today -  - I understand the news from today is that the construction division of the CFMEU has finally seen the light and withdrawn from the Australian Labor Party altogether, which, from my own point of view, is good news all round - in terms of its affiliation, that is. On the question of campaign donations, those questions should be directed to the national secretary of the party. If the honourable member seriously expects the leader of any political party to have available to him details concerning campaign finance, there would be a very interesting set of questions which I would then have directed to the Leader of the Opposition. For example, how much money from the tobacco lobby has been given to the Liberal Party in the last year and the year before that and the year before that? We have been engaged in a debate led by the member for Dickson of late about the future of public health. One of the key elements of that is preventative health strategies and yet we have one participant in the debate, the Liberal Party of Australia, which says, 'Oh, we can participate in this debate with clean hands,' while raking in the money from big tobacco on the way through. I would suggest: 'Physician heal thyself.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. Following negotiations that have happened at length over some time now between the member for Groom and Minister Wong, we are now in a position where there is a deal, which we all understand has been agreed to as of last night, to secure the opportunity for Australia to act on climate change. There is no sector of the economy more at risk from climate change than those working in our primary industries. It is important to go through some of the changes that are now there on the table and which, hopefully, in the course of this week will become law within Australia. These go all the way through the production chain, not simply for what happens on farm but for farm inputs through to work on farm and right through to the processing level.First of all, there is no input which can be a greater burden on farmers than the cost of fuel and the impact that that has. Importantly, under the agreements which have been reached, and which were announced last night, for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the fuel tax credit from 1 July 2011 through to 30 June 2014 will apply not only to agriculture and fisheries but also to those working in the forestry sector, something very much welcomed by those representatives of the forestry sector who were here in the parliament last night. In agriculture itself, whereas the government's position initially was for it to be excluded at the moment with a final decision to be made in advance of 2015, the position now is for agricultural emissions to be excluded, and excluded indefinitely. In offsets, it is important that we continue to have a system of trading which is able to be traded internationally. That is why the government continues to argue internationally for the need to separate human activity from natural causes in the international accounting mechanisms. In doing so, though, there is now agreement as to what can happen in the meantime in advance of being able to have a system of international trading in particular for soil carbon. That is why there is now agreement for a voluntary market offset system through the national carbon offset standard. That will allow application for agricultural soils, both in the area of soil carbon and in the area of biochar, also for enhanced forest management and non-forest vegetation to be credited and also for mechanisms in place for credits on regrowth and soil carbon on land which was cleared legally between 1990 and 2008.On many of these issues part of getting the international accounting working and part of getting these systems working more effectively within Australia is to improve the level of research and development. The government had already increased our commitment to R&amp;D in this space by increasing the commitment that we made at the election from $15 million to $46.2 million. As a result of the agreements with the opposition, there is now another $50 million available for research in this area. In the food-processing area - because of course those working in our primary industries know all too well that costs in food processing are just as likely, and often more likely, to be passed back to the farmer rather than to be passed on to the consumer - there is a dedicated stream within the Climate Change Action Fund of $150 million to assist with work in reducing emissions from waste water, helping with the conversion from coal to natural gas, helping with the potential for renewables. This is in addition to the eligibility that many food processors will have as manufacturers for the transitional programs which are available on electricity prices themselves. There is no sector of the economy, as I said at the beginning, more at risk from climate change. With these amendments they have a system which they can well and truly work within and which allows Australia to take action.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, on the first part of the question -  -  - This seems to result in considerable animation all round! -  - I welcome the question which has been presented on this matter. Firstly, in response to the first part of his question: yes, indeed I do the welcome the fact that, as reported, the construction division of the CFMEU has decided to disaffiliate itself from the Australian Labor Party. I do regard that as good news all round, given my historical views of that division of that union, particularly concerning the activities of certain of its leadership over a long period of time.Secondly, in relation to all details concerning campaign finance, they are properly directed to the -  - individual office bearers of the political parties concerned. Thirdly, what I have been presented with is a history of those donations by tobacco companies to the Liberal Party. Mr Speaker, it makes very interesting reading. - The question did go to the matter of donations. I have indicated how that is dealt with in the normal course of events by the relevant office bearers of political parties. Of course, the honourable member is able to make recourse to the public record of campaign donations to the Australian Labor Party - that is the law in this country. But when it comes to the Liberal Party, can I draw their attention to the fact that -  - Mr Speaker, just a quick perusal of these numbers: about $1 million has been given to the Liberal Party by a combination of British American Tobacco and Philip Morris over the years. They come here pretending to have clean hands on such questions. On the question of campaign disclosure and campaign law reform, I would also draw the attention of those opposite to what legislation has also been rejected by the Senate on the part of those opposite. I think they should reflect carefully on their record on these matters. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. He, like many listening, will know that the Antarctic is a really important place because it serves as a laboratory for climate scientists. It is also important because the Southern Ocean, which runs around the Antarctic, is an important driver of the global climate. The recently released Southern Ocean Sentinel report by the Australian Antarctic Division, World Wide Fund and the Australian Climate and Ecosystems CRC stated:Due to a warming climate, marine ecosystems both near to Antarctica and in the sub-Antarctic are already showing evident effects of impact. They include rising temperatures in the ocean and atmosphere, changes in atmospheric circulation including increasing winds and modified frequency and intensity of storms, increasing levels of ocean acidity and overall reduction in sea ice extent during the last century.Our scientists looking closely at this issue in the Southern Ocean Sentinel workshop identified a number of ecosystem components that may be vulnerable to ongoing climate change impacts through ocean acidification. They include harvested species like ice fish and krill and also species recovering from overexploitation including whales.But critically, over the last two years, a number of studies of ice accumulation and loss in both Greenland and Antarctica confirmed that both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing ice mass and contributing to sea level rise at a rate higher than previously estimated. This is important. The evidence for climate change and associated sea level rise is unequivocal. Increased ice melt in Antarctica will further increase the rate of sea level rise. A recent US study by researchers from the University of Texas that use satellite data to estimate Antarctic ice sheet masses confirmed the melting trend but also found that since 2006 ice sheets in coastal regions of east Antarctica may have lost mass too.This is consistent with the studies by our own Australian Antarctic Division suggesting major glaciers in east Antarctica are shrinking. Some people will have seen the recently released Copenhagen diagnosis concluding that several important aspects of climate change are occurring at the high end or beyond previous expectations. Taking into account Greenland and Antarctic ice shrinkage, the best estimate of the contribution to sea level rise over the last five years is that it has been about three times that previously agreed by the IPCC. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts recently identified that for many locations in Australia where many people live on or near the coast the projected 0.5 metre sea level rise would mean extreme sea level events which previously would have been a one-in-100-year frequency could potentially occur more than once a year by 2100.This is absolutely vital information for us as we make decisions about dealing with dangerous climate change. One-in-100-year emergencies potentially occurring once a year within the lifetime of our young kids or grandkids, the risks to human health, to houses near the coast, to coastal infrastructure and all the costs that come with that are issues that Australia can and must face up to. There are costs in delay, which is why the government has brought forward the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and the amendments that have been agreed between the government and the opposition must now pass through this parliament as soon as possible. We can see what is happening with our own eyes in Antarctica. We understand how important that is for ourselves and our future and we understand how important the passage of this legislation and finding common cause for the Australian people really is.</DOC>

 - On the question of competition within the food retail industry and therefore its impact on grocery prices, the government, through various ministers, has taken a range of measures. First of all, when it comes to foreign investors, for example, into the proper rollout of supermarkets across the country, we have deliberately changed the rules so that those who are seeking to invest are not required to have the construction of a new supermarket on the land they have purchased for the construction of that supermarket to be done within the normally constrained period of time which existed under the previous foreign investment rule. -  - Those opposite interject that foreign competition from other major grocery retailers is somehow irrelevant to the grocery price. Can I suggest to those opposite it is not - it is highly relevant. Therefore, if you go to a range of other measures which concern also the way in which leases et cetera are operated -  - The honourable member asked me a question about competition and prices in the grocery sector and I was responding to his question. Firstly, the government has taken measures to enable foreign owned supermarkets like Aldi and Costco to more easily expand their operations in Australia. After the government made the change I referred to before, Aldi announced its plans to expand and open up a further 500 stores across Australia. If those opposite are suggesting that has no impact on competition within the grocery sector, I do not think they are analysing these facts and figures fairly. That is one measure.Furthermore, can I also refer the honourable gentleman to what the government has done in relation to unit pricing. It becomes mandatory for major supermarkets from December of this year, and this will empower consumers to make informed choices about supermarket items that constitute the best value for money. On the question of unit pricing, which is a debate that has been going on for years and years and years, they had 12 years to act on this and we have been able to act on that within our first two years in office, and it comes into effect as of December this year. Furthermore, in September the ACCC ended restrictive agreements in leases between shopping centres and Coles and Woolworths which restricted rivals from setting up in shopping centres.The honourable member asked a question about what in practical terms the government has done about grocery prices and the competition forces which underpin grocery prices out there in the community. There are three practical measures we have undertaken and implemented in our first two years in office contrasted with the 12 years of inaction on this by those opposite when they had ample opportunity to act - ample opportunity to go in there and make a difference - and they did precisely nothing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Can I take this opportunity to congratulate her for the work she has done leading a parliamentary committee looking at fair pay and fair treatment of women workers. It has been a very important contribution to that debate and policy development.I am asked by the member for Hasluck about developments in the Youth Allowance debate. There have been three since question time yesterday. First, the government negotiated with the Greens party and with Senator Xenophon on measures that they sought to improve transition arrangements in Youth Allowance - that is, improved arrangements for students who are currently on a gap year. The government has reached agreement with the Greens party and with Senator Xenophon on those improvements, which are budget neutral. I thank the Greens party and Senator Xenophon for the maturity and skill that they have brought to this debate, and I suspect many Australian students will be thanking them as well.The second development is that the Senate rejected the coalition's amendments. Those amendments were always unacceptable because they blew a more than $1 billion hole in the budget. At the same time, they entrenched a system which had been shown to lead to a result where the participation rates of country kids in universities went backwards. That is, it was fiscally irresponsible and grossly unfair, and the Senate has rejected those amendments.Then, at number 3, in the most churlish and destructive act seen in this parliament in many a long year, despite the Senate repudiation of their amendments, the coalition voted to stop the beneficial amendments that we had agreed with the Greens and Senator Xenophon. They voted to stop a change to make the system easier in transition for students and then engaged in a Senate procedure which effectively blocks the bill.What have the coalition done through this destructive, churlish act? I can tell you, Mr Speaker, what they have done. They have set this parliament on a course where the newly negotiated improved transition arrangements for students have been blocked. They have set this parliament on a course where 150,000 students will miss out on scholarships next year. They have set this parliament on a course where country kids needing to move will not get $4,000 relocation scholarships next year. They have set this parliament on a course where next year a kid in a family earning $44,165 will not get full youth allowance. How mean, how petty, can you be? They have set this parliament on a course where we will not be able to bring the age of independence for getting youth allowance down to 22 years old.Those who care about education in this country have reacted with absolute fury to this churlish, petulant, destructive act by the coalition. The sector is incredulous that the coalition could be as anti-student as this. In the words of the Australian Technology Network of Universities:Failure by the Coalition and Family First Senator, Steve Fielding to support this amended legislation is not only bad for the education system in Australia, but it's bad social policy and is very bad long term economic policy._            _            _The amended Bill would have delivered a level of financial security for those students most in need._            _            _These scholarships help very poor students give more time and attention to their studies by reducing stress and worry, reducing their paid work hours, and increasing their sense of belonging. As a result, these students have attrition rates about 40% lower than other students - the benefit of this scholarship is tangible.These scholarships have been ripped out of the hands of Australian students by the churlish, petulant actions of the Liberal Party. Students have spoken and they have said this:Last night we thought so many good elements were blocked.A drop in the age of independence to 22, blocked; new personal income test thresholds, blocked; new scholarships, blocked; a system that gets the poorer students to university, blocked. As students have said:_ what remains is _ an inequitable relic of the Howard era.It is easily rorted by the privileged. It means 30 per cent of gap year students will not return to university. The current system disadvantages poor and regional students the most. The fury in the education sector today because of this petulance and destruction by the coalition is clear.Despite this destructive act, we are going to give the coalition - the Liberal and National parties - an opportunity to stop this conduct and stop their war against students. Later today, I will reintroduce the bill as amended with the new beneficial provisions agreed by the Greens party and Senator Xenophon. This is now finally decision day for the coalition. There are hundreds of thousands of students who are waiting for their money next year. It will be on the coalition's head, each and every member, if the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of students in their electorates who would get these new scholarships miss out because of their actions in the Senate. I find it remarkable that anybody who claims to represent an electorate or a state in this parliament could set themselves on such a destructive course. It is time that the coalition actually did something for students instead of continuing their war against students, particularly their war against country kids, who, under their blocking of this legislation, will finish last.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. He indeed is not correct. Earlier this year, I went to the Dynon rail link and opened it with the Australian Rail Track Corporation Chair, Barry Murphy. Last night, we were indeed with the Australian Rail Track Corporation, along with the finance minister, and we had a discussion about the opening of the Dynon rail link and the fact that the ribbon being held by the chair of the ARTC, Barry Murphy, and me across the rail link was not quite long enough and we had to make a decision about who would get hit by the train - me or the chair of the ARTC. The chair of the ARTC got out of the way because he understood that it is that side of politics that likes getting run over by trains, usually self-inflicted.I am asked about the government's infrastructure commitments and what we have been doing, and the shadow minister refers to what they have done. That is timely, because he was the minister for transport in the former government and today, indeed, the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics has released a document, 'Public road related expenditure and revenue in Australia 2009', that goes through -  - That report makes pretty interesting reading, because what it indicates is that the Howard government, in its last two budgets, slashed road spending by almost 40 per cent. - I am not surprised they are embarrassed by this, because at the very time that record revenues were coming into Treasury coffers -  - Indeed -  -  - This report shows that the previous government cut the annual federal roads budget from $4.3 billion in 2005-06 to $2.7 billion in -  - They are embarrassed because they cut road funding from $4.3 billion in 2005-06 to $2.7 billion in 2007-08. They are of course the only side of parliament that is talking about cutting infrastructure spending. Indeed, on 7 October Senator Coonan said this:It's a very good opportunity for the Government to take a very good look at whether this final part of the stimulus package is really necessary - that is, the infrastructure spend. The Leader of the Opposition told the Adelaide Advertiser on 20 May:_ everything will have to be reviewed. There's no question about that _That is what he had to say about infrastructure spending that is taking place right across the country -  - a doubling of the expenditure on the roads and a quadrupling on rail. Indeed, a media release dated 8 April 2009 said the following:ARTC Chairman, Barry Murphy, joined Minister Albanese at today's event - that is, the opening of the Tottenham to Dynon rail link. The ARTC chairman, appointed by you, said this:'It is symbolic that the Tottenham to Dynon Rail Link be officially opened with the passage of a new Pacific National locomotive, as the upgrade represents another step forward in the resurgence of freight rail in Australia,' said Mr Murphy.'ARTC is proud to partner with the Rudd Government in breathing new life into freight rail.'We have breathed new life into freight rail. Perhaps the National Party needs a bit of new life as well.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and for his support for this very important work which is helping to reform the welfare system. Earlier today I introduced landmark legislation into the House that will see major reforms to our welfare system. There will be a new approach to income management that will see help provided to families and to individuals who are disengaged to make sure that, for those people, we see more welfare payments spent on the essentials of life and, particularly, spent in the interests of children.These reforms, as the member for Solomon just said, build on the government's commitment to make sure that we have a welfare system based on the principles of engagement, participation and responsibility. This will be a new national approach to welfare reform. It will start in the Northern Territory from 1 July next year and will be rolled out in urban, regional and remote parts of the Northern Territory. After an evaluation of our experience in the Northern Territory and other places in Australia where we are trialling various forms of welfare conditionality, it will be rolled out in other disadvantaged regions of the country. It will apply to young people who are not engaged in education, training or work; to the long-term unemployed who are seriously disengaged; to parents who fail to show parental responsibility; to families who are referred by child protection authorities to Centrelink to have their welfare payments income managed; and to those vulnerable Australians who have been identified by a Centrelink social worker as being at risk. There will be exemptions in this new approach for those who are engaged in full-time study or training, those who have a history of employment and parents who do demonstrate that they are doing the right thing by their children and making sure they are going to school. There will also be a system of voluntary income management attached to the scheme.This scheme has had some positive responses already from Toby Hall, for example, from Mission Australia, who has welcomed the approach, saying that a little bit of pressure to move people off benefits is a good thing. There has also been some very positive evidence that income management is in fact working, particularly for families and their children. We have had some significant responses through the wide-ranging consultations that we have recently conducted in the Northern Territory, in which thousands of people participated. They told us loud and clear that they had more money to spend on food, to pay their rent and to buy clothes for the kids and that they were in fact spending less money on alcohol and gambling, for example. Just today there was a piece in the Northern Territory News from the manager of the supermarket at Yirrkala. He said that people at Yirrkala had seen a drop in gambling and less antisocial behaviour and, as he says, he knows firsthand that more money is being spent on essentials. So we have certainly got some very practical evidence to show that this is helpful.These changes are of course part of a wide range of different approaches to welfare reform that this government has put in place: in the Cape York welfare reform trials, in metropolitan Perth and the Kimberley region and through the school enrolment and attendance reforms in Queensland and the Northern Territory. There are now around 400 people on income management in Western Australia and around 90 in the Cape York welfare reform trial areas. Today's legislation also very significantly reinstates the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act to the Northern Territory Emergency Response, something that this government has been determined to do.These are very significant reforms, and we certainly look forward to the opposition's support for them. I particularly want to show my appreciation to the Northern Territory government. The Chief Minister's support and assistance in the development of this package has been extremely helpful as the Northern Territory government confronts a very serious level of disadvantage in many parts of the territory.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question because he has an intense interest in the future of all of those commodities which are particularly concentrated in the north-west. For that reason I was pleased to visit there some three or four months ago and to meet with all of the industries from the region. I was very pleased to do so with the Queensland Treasurer and, in particular, to discuss with locals the implications of the Sims report, what that means in terms of the supply of power to that region, whether or not there would be a transmission line and how that was being handled by the framework put in place by the Queensland government. I also think it was very productive that, at the roundtable convened only about a month ago here in Canberra with my colleague Minister Ferguson and also the member for Kennedy, the member for Leichhardt and the member for Dawson, we had a very important discussion about the renewable energy resources in that region and how they might be further developed and, in particular, about the importance of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the RET that we have put in place to drive investment in that region, most particularly investment in renewable energy.As the member for Kennedy knows, the process in terms of the future of the supply of power to the region, and whether it is a transmission line that comes from Townsville or it is generated locally, is very much part of a private sector process that the Queensland government is engaged in at the moment. I will certainly be encouraging my Queensland colleagues to facilitate that as quickly as possible, because an enormous amount of investment hangs off the decision that is taken in that process. But there is no doubt that putting in place the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, if it is passed by this House, will be one very important concrete step to facilitate the processes that flow from that, including extracting maximum value from our renewable energy target. So we must get that piece of legislation through the House.There is an enormous potential in this region. This government, committed to working with the Queensland government, does hold very dear the objectives that he has outlined in his question today. The federal government and the Queensland government will continue to do everything we possibly can to put in place the framework to secure the objectives that the member for Kennedy has at the very core of his question. But the one thing that we need here is the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme through the House to provide the stability and the certainty to essential investment in this very important sector, which goes to the core of our national prosperity and the core of prosperity in so many of our great regions of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question because it gives me the opportunity to report some really good news to the parliament about the rollout of the 31 GP superclinics that were promised at the election with a $275 million commitment. That number has now increased to 36 clinics across the country, with a very enthusiastic reception by, for example, the member for Parkes for his community's superclinic.In September I was delighted to be able to go with the member for Ballarat to open the first fully functioning superclinic in Ballan. That Ballan clinic is providing increased GP services and, for the first time ever in the community of Ballan, dental services. I have not had the opportunity to report to the rest of the House or to the Prime Minister, in fact, these new figures that we have in from the first 10 weeks of work at the clinic. Remember that this is a community of around 8,000 to 10,000 people but servicing a much broader community. In the first 10 weeks of the clinic there have been 12,050 presentations - approximately 8,000 GP presentations and 4,000 allied health presentations. I am also pleased to be able to advise the House that a female GP is due to start at the clinic next week, another first for the community of Ballan.At six other sites - Bendigo, Southern Lake Macquarie, Palmerston, Devonport, Blue Mountains and Warnervale - there are early services being provided to the community. I know the member for Bendigo will be particularly pleased that the interim services have commenced in Bendigo, where the existing Monash University primary care centre is transitioning to become the Bendigo GP superclinic. Preparation for construction is underway and the following new activities have been introduced as part of the transition plan. A mental health program with two weekly sessions by mental health nurses and mental health workers for new and existing patients is being provided as part of that early service delivery, and a training program for practice nurses to commence upskilling in chronic disease management and women's health. At Palmerston, the federal member has been delighted that the after-hours service provided there has seen 9,000 patients visit since it opened last December, with 92 per cent of patients being treated at the clinic, reducing by that significant number those who otherwise have to travel and present at the emergency department at Royal Darwin Hospital.Twenty-eight contracts have now been signed. Every single contract includes, of course, general practitioners. Ten of these contracts have local divisions of GPs as active partners and 22 of these contracts have university involvement. That means that the superclinics are not only providing vital services, like those in Ballan and Palmerston and increasingly in Bendigo, but are also playing an important role as active participants in training and teaching the next generation of our health professionals, working in communities that have been underserviced for many, many years. This is good news for those communities and shows that our commitment to health, particularly through the GP superclinic strategy, is paying off for those communities. It is good news to report to the House.</DOC>

 - It is good to see that Senator Ronaldson has been useful not only on the numbers but also in providing the Ronaldson doctrine, which has to do with reinforcing stereotypes. We have seen a bit of that in the debate in this chamber in the course of the last several weeks.I would draw the honourable member's attention to the following facts concerning the impact of security circumstances, which has been felt around the world, arising from the developments in Iraq, developments in Afghanistan and developments in Sri Lanka. I would draw the honourable member's attention, for example, to the fact that the total number of those with asylum claims worldwide - this is data from the UNHCR - went up from 14,511 in 2005 to 42,478 in 2008. For Europe, it went from 10,295 in 2005 to 37,069 in 2008. If we go to Afghanistan, we see a similar pattern. We see that in 2005 there were some 5,600 Afghanis seeking asylum, rising in 2008 to 14,177 for Europe and 18,440 worldwide. So too with Sri Lanka - in 2005 the worldwide figure was 5,600 and in 2008 it is nearly 10,000. These are the statistical underpinnings of what is occurring around the world, whether it is Iraq, whether it is Afghanistan or whether it is Sri Lanka, and these therefore are the practical challenges that we are speaking about.The honourable member also referred to the proportion of the total humanitarian intake for Australia each year represented by arrivals coming from various parts of the world. I draw his attention also to the proportion represented by arrivals in Australia coming by all means and seeking asylum. Take, for example, 2007, when we had a total of 4,133 asylum seekers arrive in Australia both by boat and by other means. We had 3,581 in 2006; 3,200 in 2005; 3,200 in 2004; 4,439 in 2003 -  - We know that it has been a while since Joe has been allowed to ask a question on jobs. According to our data here, it has in fact been 105 days since the opposition asked the government a question about jobs. We have now had 88 questions on asylum seekers. - I wonder what pattern this reflects. The honourable member's question went to the proportion of the total Australian humanitarian intake taken up by various groups of people arriving in Australia in a given year. I was simply apprising those opposite of the facts and figures concerning the total number of asylum seekers arriving in Australia during the period that they were in office. The figures ranged from 10,000 in 1996, to 15,000 in 2000, to 17,000 in 2001; and, in the last year they were in office, there were some 4,000. Those opposite seem very keen to reflect a particular view of the statistics.What I have sought to do in my answer is reflect what is happening worldwide for all countries in terms of outflows from Afghanistan, from Iraq and from Sri Lanka. Of all those numbers, when it comes to Sri Lanka, we have had some 600 or so arrive in Australian waters. On top of that, what I have also tried to reflect to those opposite in the answer is that, if you look at the total number of asylum seekers arriving by boat and by other means in Australia under their watch, the challenges that we face these days are by no means unique. These challenges have been faced by governments in the past and they will be faced by governments in the future.I would suggest to those opposite, as they pursue the Ronaldson doctrine of stereotyping - part of the infamous Ronaldson email entitled 'Digging dirt' - that, if they are going to continue to engage in these sorts of tactics, they should at least extend to the House the courtesy of framing them within historical fact and statistical reality. The government's policy on these matters is clear; we still await some clarity in terms of what those opposite offer by way of an alternative.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the Australian government is acting on climate change through the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - I suspect that that was not the first dog whistle that we have heard in the parliament today and it will not be the last dog whistle we will hear in the parliament today. But I will leave it to those opposite to wrestle with their consciences on that question, as hard as that may be.The question I was asked was about climate change and carbon pollution reduction. The Australian government is acting on climate change by introducing a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to reduce Australia's level of carbon production, by supporting Australian families and Australian businesses with any higher adjustment costs coming from a higher carbon price, by building the clean energy jobs we need for the future and by ensuring that Australia plays its part in cooling the planet for our kids and for our grandkids.The alternative to action is to continue the inaction we have seen for 12 years. We are not proposing to do that. Instead, we have introduced the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and we look forward to seeing its passage through the Senate. To continue to engage in inaction on climate change would mean that we would continue to deny one core fact: the economic cost of inaction on climate change is far greater than the economic cost of action on climate change. To sustain a policy of inaction would be to deny the reality confronting Australians that we live in one of the hottest and driest continents on the earth. It would be to deny also the impact of inaction on drought, on fire, on extreme weather events, on coastal inundation, on the cost of insurance, on agriculture - including the projected 50 per cent fall in total agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin - and on the Great Barrier Reef. Inaction on climate change would result in the destruction of the reef over time and the 60,000 jobs generated by reef tourism. That is the economic cost of inaction.Instead, the Australian government is acting through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The Department of Climate Change forecasts that by 2011 to 2013 Australia's greenhouse gas emissions will start to fall. By 2020, there will be 138 megatons less carbon pollution than business as usual. To put that into context, that is the equivalent of taking some 35 million cars off the road, which is twice the size of the entire Australian motor vehicle fleet.That is our action here at home through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. But we must also see action abroad. I welcome the news overnight that President Obama will attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. I understand that 75 world leaders have already committed to attending the Copenhagen conference.Yesterday the White House also announced that President Obama is prepared to put forward at Copenhagen a provisional US emissions reduction target of 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. This announcement will help build momentum towards an ambitious global agreement in Copenhagen. I quote from the White House statement released at the time of President Obama's commitment:The President's decision to go is a sign of his continuing commitment and leadership to find a global solution to the global threat of climate change, and to lay the foundation for a new, sustainable and prosperous clean energy future.The Australian government continues to work closely with the government of the United States on its climate change policy, as we do with the government of China on its policy. We welcome the constructive role being played by China and we welcome also the work which China is currently undertaking on its national response to climate change in the lead-up to Copenhagen.I wish to inform the House that I have been invited by the President of the United States to meet with him in Washington next Monday following the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting this weekend in Trinidad. -  - I am taken aback by the outburst. Is it anti-Americanism on the part of those opposite? I am a bit puzzled by that. This is a strange world in which we live. We are now supposed to have a united position on climate change - both sides of the House have indicated which way they are going - yet each time I raise the issue of climate change there is a cacophony on the part of those opposite, who are still out there lurking in the dark with the international league of climate change conspirators, believing that it is all one big communist plot. But today it gets worse. When I indicate to the House that the President of the United States has invited me to go to Washington next Monday to discuss the Copenhagen agenda, somehow that is bad news. I would have thought that it is a good thing for the Australia-US relationship. I would have thought it is a good thing for our combined action on climate change. I would think that it is a good thing in terms of the alliance between our two great democracies. The fact that we are currently in the field with the Americans in Afghanistan and elsewhere underlines the closeness of our relationship. - The Leader of the National Party interjects. He is concerned about the fact that we will be talking about more than climate change in Washington - another deep conspiracy. There are a few other things going on in the Australia-US relationship and our common efforts in Afghanistan which I do not think are invisible to the public - the fact that we are there together - and it would be a logical subject of discussion in Washington, particularly given that the United States administration is developing its own response on a long-term military commitment in that country.Our challenge of course is not just with the United States on this matter. Our challenge of course is to work through the number of developed and developing countries which will be meeting at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Trinidad and Tobago this weekend. The Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago has also invited President Sarkozy to attend the meeting, together with the UN Secretary-General and Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark. -  - Those opposite constantly seek to ridicule global efforts to bring about an outcome on climate change. Given that they have decided as a party to work together with the government on climate change, I would have thought that that would not stop at the continental shelf but would actually go offshore as well. Therefore, when it comes to America, which is the world's single largest polluter, together with China, and with the developing countries which will be gathered together in Trinidad and Tobago, I would have thought this would be welcomed as a good thing.The honourable member also asked a question about recent reports on climate change. I know the member for Sturt will be particularly interested in this, given the relevance of climate change to the good people of Sturt, who may in the future have him or someone else as their elected member. In the last couple of days a new report, the Copenhagen Diagnosis, was released. This was co-authored by 26 researchers, many of whom are authors of published reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The conclusions of the report are as follows, and they are disturbing. First of all, every year since 2000 has been among the top 10 warmest years since instrumental records began. - Another interjection over there. In his view the planet is cooling, not warming. - The trend is cooling. Well -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Copenhagen Diagnosis, which was co-authored by 26 researchers, I would have thought would be of interest to all members of the House because some of its conclusions are indeed troubling on the question of climate change. One, every year since 2000 has been among the top 10 warmest years since instrumental records began. Two, recent melting of Arctic sea ice has been around 40 per cent higher than the IPCC predictions. Three, sea levels have risen by more than five centimetres over the past 15 years. This is around 80 per cent higher than the projections from the IPCC report in 2001. Four, measurements now demonstrate beyond doubt that both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass at an accelerating rate. Furthermore, human induced climate change is expected to lead to an increase in extreme weather events around the planet.These are the disturbing conclusions which are contained in this particular report. They are also particularly relevant to the Pacific island countries in our own region. The Pacific island countries will be represented at CHOGM. Their interests are of great concern to Australia. Fifty per cent of the population of the Pacific island countries live within one kilometre of their coastline - one kilometre. Therefore, in terms of sea levels rising, the impact on them is great. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is important because it brings together so many small island countries from the Pacific and elsewhere, also forging a deal in the lead-up to Copenhagen to try and craft a Copenhagen agreement. That is why the actions of the United States and China are particularly relevant.The government has been active on climate change at home through the legislation before the House and equally active abroad. I would invite all members to again display a positive attitude in supporting this government's global negotiations with other countries as we seek to bring about a Copenhagen agreement for the future.</DOC>

 - The government was clear-cut about the policies on this question when it went to the last election. Our policies concern the importance of the non-proliferation treaty. The government intends no disrespect whatsoever to the government and the people of India, given that the government of India's history on non-proliferation is very good. What I would say is that the particular representations that we received both from the Bush administration and from the government of India in recent years have concerned the changes which occurred through the deliberations of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the provision of nuclear materials to India by a range of countries around the world. As the honourable member will be aware if she has read her briefs on this subject, the Australian government was exceptionally supportive and constructive in the negotiation of that process through the Nuclear Suppliers Group when a range of additional countries in fact were not. This has also been reflected in the responses which the government has received from the Indian government as a result of our positive approach adopted in those negotiations.That is the approach we have adopted on these matters. Obviously we value our relationship with India. We will continue to work with India in terms of their overall energy needs. The joint declaration, which was signed by Prime Minister Singh and me when I was in New Delhi only a couple of weeks ago, reflects indeed the expanded scope and potential for energy cooperation in a whole range of areas in the future. This is a very good relationship between Australia and India. It is one to which this government attaches the highest priority and we will continue to work on that relationship in the future. India is one of the economic superpowers of the 21st century, and we intend to invest every level of resource we can in ensuring that relationship is elevated at the political level, the security level and the economic level. I would draw the honourable member's attention to the contents of the joint declaration, which was signed when I was in New Delhi with Prime Minister Singh only a few weeks ago.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for the question. I can attest to the House that he has been a very persistent advocate on behalf of coalminers and their families in his electorate and also on behalf of renewable energy projects in the electorate of Dawson as well.The Prime Minister, just a few minutes ago, was referring to the latest scientific report that has been released, The Copenhagen Diagnosis, which warns that climate change is occurring quicker than had previously been expected. It underlines again that, if we do not act, Australia faces huge potential economic costs from the impacts on water security, energy supplies, health, coastal communities and other infrastructure. On top of this the Treasury modelling has shown that if we defer action Australia will face long-term costs around 15 per cent higher than if we act now. To put that into a global context, the International Energy Agency says it will cost an additional $500 billion to cut global emissions for each year that action is delayed. As we have remarked previously, Australia will miss out on jobs in the growing global carbon market if we do not start making this transformation now.There has been some commentary in recent days, too, about the issue of household compensation to meet the costs of the introduction of a carbon price into the economy. The government has provided for significant levels of assistance to low- and middle-income households to deal with this transition. Under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, pensioners, seniors, carers and people with disability will be fully compensated for expected increases in the cost of living. In fact around 90 per cent of low-income households will receive assistance equal to 120 per cent of their cost of living increase. And 97 per cent of middle-income households will receive some direct cash assistance, with 50 per cent of them being fully compensated. It is worth noting that the opposition leader, the member for Wentworth, indicated on the Sunrise program yesterday that the government's CPRS included 'an adequate and fair and sustainable level of assistance for households'.The Senate is now debating amendments to the CPRS, and the fundamental position is that it is time to get on and pass the legislation. It is time that the sceptics and the conspiracy theorists on the other side stepped aside and got out of the way. They have had their time in the sun; it is time to pass the legislation. We had, as parliament will recall, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate seriously positing on the Four Corners program that after the decline of communism, the international left somehow got behind the environment movement and climate change in an attempt to de-industrialise the western world - a preposterous proposition for someone with his responsibility. Senator Bernardi has offered, during the second reading debate in the Senate, the following words:I do not and will not worship at the altar of green witchcraft.Others have remained captured, as I indicated yesterday, by Lord Monckton's world government conspiracy theory. Senator Cash indicated in the second reading debate that she is convinced of an evil United Nations conspiracy to take over the Australian economy. Senator Boswell is travelling in cyberspace finding adherence to Lord Monckton's theory. We have had Nazi equated to climate science; the member for Warringah believing the science is irrelevant because grapes grew in Roman times on Hadrian's Wall; the member for Mackellar proclaiming that the burning of dung is the biggest problem here; and Senator Abetz arguing that weeds are the greatest threat to the climate. Of course, Senator Joyce seriously posited through all of this that we will be paying $150 for a leg of lamb.Enough is enough. There have been enough absurd, ridiculous, bizarre contributions from that side of politics in the sceptics and theorists camp, and it is time that it finished. It is time that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation be passed. The Business Council, the Australian Industry Group, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Council of Social Service, the ACTU, environment groups and premiers all want this legislation passed. The deal needs to be honoured and the legislation needs to be passed.When this legislation is passed it will join the list of great Labor reforms in this country: the opening up of the economy in the 1980s, the decentralisation of the industrial relations system, Medicare, universal superannuation, social security, equal opportunity, trade practices and corporations law. All of these great reforms are Labor reforms. And the government's action on climate change will join that wonderful list. It will be a huge nation-building contribution.</DOC>

 - It seems that the dog whistle continues in parliament today. -  - The honourable member interjects, 'For heaven's sake.' We are not blind to what is going on on the other side of politics at the present. We are not blind to the tensions which exist within the coalition. It is a sad day indeed when the only thing they can seem to unite on is this continued Ronaldson doctrine driven campaign which is to stereotype the entire debate about asylum seekers in this country. That is what is going on. Let us just call it for what it is.The honourable member asks about Villawood detention centre. I would imagine that all appropriate preparations are made for the continued refurbishment and proper provision of facilities in detention centres for a long, long time. Can I just go back to one core point relevant to this and other related questions which the honourable member and others on his side of the parliament have asked, and it is this: if those opposite were seriously of the view that the problem concerning asylum seekers had simply disappeared, why did they then proceed to build an 800-bed facility on Christmas Island? This is a process that was begun, as I recall it, in about 2004, 2005 or thereabouts. I thought that those opposite said that it was problem solved, that they had all these policies in place, that the problem had disappeared and - there was no such thing as global factors, of course - that it was a uniquely Australian response to a uniquely Australian challenge. Yet mysteriously, out of that, they had to build an 800-bed detention facility on Christmas Island.The truth is that public administration requires proper preparation for dealing with a whole range of contingencies. The previous government acted in that way by preparing Christmas Island. The current government is also doing so in terms of additional capacity at Christmas Island and further preparations in onshore Australia. It is the right and responsible course of action, because future contingencies have to be planned for. That is the right way in which you handle this.Again I draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that, worldwide, the numbers who are now exiting Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka have gone up. This has been occurring since 2005. It has been occurring as a consequence of global push factors concerning security within those states. As a consequence, all countries in the world - France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Canada, the United States, those of South-East Asia - are dealing with the same global push factors. The responsible course of action is to handle these matters in a practical fashion rather than simply have it fall within the rubric of the Ronaldson doctrine that you cannot generate good stories out of normal policy debates, that the best way to generate good stories is out of perpetuating stereotypes in the community. That is precisely what the opposition is now doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, while it has received a great deal of attention over previous weeks, is not the only policy involved in the government responding to climate change. While it deals with aspects of trying to mitigate and reduce carbon emissions, one of the challenges faced by the farmers of Australia is to adapt to the changes which are happening in the climate.Anyone who was here during the previous term of government would remember endless lectures being given by those who were then on this side of the House about the importance of mutual responsibility, or mutual obligation, as they used to term it - they claimed they had levels of support for that and they claimed that the then opposition did not understand the importance of mutual responsibility. So it surprised me when the member for Parkes decided to rail against principles of mutual responsibility within my portfolio.One of the things that we established on coming to government was, because a number of areas were starting to come out of exceptional circumstances, to make sure that, for the most desperate farmers in those areas, there remained a way for them to receive food-on-the-table money, the household payments - in a limited scheme, but certainly we were replacing what previously would have been no support for them at all. One of the things that farmers do when they are involved in receiving the transitional income support is they deal with the Rural Financial Counselling Service and undertake a level of training to help them plan for the future. One of the terms involved in conducting this planning is the term 'climate change'. This brought an understandable reaction from the National Party. The member for Parkes, on ABC radio earlier this week, said, 'Ultimately, to be eligible, they have to undertake some form of training, and I find that most offensive.' He found it 'most offensive' that there would be a level of mutual responsibility and there would be training.So I thought I would have a look at the sort of support that the Rural Financial Counselling Service provides when people are applying for transitional income support, just so that everyone in this House understands what it is that the National Party finds offensive: financial assessment and planning; business management; budgeting; taking into account the taxation implications; drought recovery; climate forecasting; climate risk management planning; climate change impacts and risk information - indeed anything that you would have thought is a sensible way for governments to assist some of the most desperate farmers. The National Party is willing to rail against that, not because it is not smart policy, not because it is not helping the farmers plan for the future, but because it involves the words 'climate change', and, the moment you say that, the National Party just start frothing at the mouth, even on something of mutual responsibility, which we were always told was a cornerstone of what the coalition actually believed in.The term of 'climate change' for the National Party has become like the concept of 'don't mention the war'. The moment you say 'climate change' the coalition abandons concepts of mutual responsibility, the world becomes flat and Virginia Trioli becomes a very remarkable judge of character. It is that same consistent response of loathing, the way they respond to words, the way the National Party responds to the words 'climate change', the way the Leader of the Opposition responds to the words 'Godwin Grech' and the way half the Liberal Party responds to the words 'Malcolm Turnbull'.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question because, as the parliamentary year draws to a close, I think it is worth reflecting on the impact of the global financial crisis on our economy and also on the challenges that lie ahead in the next year or so. It is the case that share markets around the world suffered their biggest decline since the 1927 stock market collapse. It is also the case that we have suffered the sharpest contraction in the global economy since the Great Depression. Something like 12 million workers in advanced economies have lost their jobs and every major advanced economy has fallen into deep recession. Australia was in danger of following suit.As we are aware, the very prompt and decisive action by the government, the Reserve Bank and the resilience in the Australian community did help Australia withstand the full impact of this global recession. As the IMF said only a few weeks ago:An aggressive policy response is likely to help Australia escape a contraction in 2009.I think all Australians can be proud of what we have all achieved together - employers and employees - to cushion the impact on our economy by pulling together and working together at this difficult time. Because we have done that, we have come through in a stronger position than any other advanced economy. This is what the OECD confirmed last week in their report:Australia has stronger growth, lower unemployment, lower debt and lower deficits than other advanced economies.The government's stimulus has meant that we did avoid recession and, in doing that, the destruction on capital, the destruction of skills and the destruction on communities. Of course, there are very substantial challenges that remain. We are under no illusions about that. The government are fairly and squarely focused on the challenges that lie ahead through next year.The IMF has already indicated that the global recovery is uneven, that it is not yet self-sustaining and that it remains dependent on policy support. As we showed in MYEFO there is still spare capacity. The economy is expected to operate below capacity for some time and unemployment is still expected to rise. We are still feeling the effects on our terms of trade and, of course, on business investment. We can see that today in the capex data. It shows that capital expenditure by businesses fell by 3.9 per cent in the September quarter. While investment plans for 2009-10 have improved somewhat, they remain 7.7 per cent lower than the same estimate for 2008-09. The importance of that is that the government's investment and infrastructure does remain very important in terms of supporting business and employment in the year ahead. I think it underscores the importance of the economic stimulus.We are in a better position than we expected earlier in the year. That is a good thing. And we do know that we are better placed than many other economies to meet the challenges ahead. That is why the government are moving to put in place reforms like the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. That is why we are working hard on our productivity agenda and why we are serious about reforming the tax system. The country has some hard yards ahead. Reform is never easy. We have seen that in the House with the reaction by some to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. What we do know is that there will be difficult reforms ahead. The important thing is that this government have the commitment to put those in place and, in doing that, we do need maximum unity in this parliament. All sides of the House need to work together so that we can maximise the opportunities for the future to make ourselves more prosperous, to support employment and to support business. That is why the government are so focused on our reform program as we go through the year and into the years ahead.</DOC>

 - I welcome this question, because one month ago this Monday I presented MYEFO - an update of the budget forecast, the economic outlook and the budget outlook. I have not had a question from the shadow Treasurer about that in one month. Admittedly, he was away for a period of time. The family had a young baby. I understand that. But for him not to ask a question at any stage during this week about the MYEFO document, which forecasts stronger growth and lower net debt - some $50 billion lower net debt - or not to ask a question about those figures in one month just shows you what fundamental misjudgment the opposition has and how disorganised it is in its approach to economic policy or, for that matter, any other policy. It is very sloppy. It is definitely very sloppy. The opposition has been running this classic scare campaign about rising interest rates. - The shadow Treasurer knows full well that all of the estimates are there in MYEFO, but I am happy to run him through them. Let us go through it: net interest payments for 2009-10 are around $2 billion or 0.2 per cent of GDP; net interest payments are projected to rise to $8.2 billion or 0.6 per cent of GDP by 2012-13. Those are the figures. They have been there in MYEFO for over a month. But the opposition have not been able to summon the political will to ask a question about them. Let me tell you why this question has taken so long: they are so acutely embarrassed by their opposition to our stimulus packages that they cannot come into the House -  - I have run through the numbers, but I want to go through the economic outlook that lies behind the numbers. This government had to borrow responsibly to support small business and to support employment. What the Mid-Year Fiscal and Economic Outlook showed was this: as a result of the global recession, we have had to write down revenues by $170 billion. The course of action that we took in those circumstances was to borrow responsibly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. Yes, it is important that federal public servants provide advice to the government in an impartial and committed way and I am, sadly, aware of recent instances where that did not occur. Yesterday the Senate Privileges Committee published its report on the Godwin Grech affair and made public a number of emails that are rather extraordinary. I would just like to quote a few of these emails to give an indication of the seriousness of what has prevailed here.First, an email from Mr Grech to a Mr John O'Sullivan, who I understand is a key supporter of the Leader of the Opposition, says:What I have in mind is that once Rudd and his hacks sign off on Ford Credit - you and I can change the contract to reflect your preferred fee arrangement and push that through quickly next week. I will not be running it past Henry and co.Secondly, from Mr Grech to a redacted - that is, not disclosed - name:My immediate motivation is to place myself where I think I could be of most value to MT - I think we know who MT is - and the Party. At this stage, I am probably more valuable here in Treasury (albeit the personal risks I am taking). I am also doing some fundraising for MT. He tells me the cupboard is bare.And an email from Mr Grech to none other than MT - That the member been no longer heard.Question put.</DOC>

 - I sure do thank the shadow minister for small business for his question. It must be a blessed relief, because it is 546 days since he last asked me a question. If he had missed out today - and I am glad that the member for O'Connor has agreed, as chair of tactics, that he should finally get a question - it would have been 614 days until 2 February. The clock was ticking. It would have been 53,136,000 seconds since he last asked a question, so he has just slipped in, in the nick of time. - It is on my hand, absolutely. I do it every day - waiting, waiting, waiting. The great moment has occurred just before the reshuffle, just in the nick of time. But to answer the question, in relation to BAS Easy, we have produced a very substantial reform in the form of standard business reporting, which will cut down GST paperwork requirements by up to 70 per cent. We are concentrating on the standard business reporting initiative, which I think was actually supported by the previous coalition government, by the previous member for Higgins. That standard business reporting mechanism is going to be very effective in achieving the very objectives of BAS Easy.We are nevertheless going through a public consultation process working with the small business community, with those who remain outside of the standard business reporting initiative, so that we can work with them through the simplified accounting methods available under the GST administration, to do everything we can - to do what the coalition failed to do. I remember a book about -  -  - You can join the book club. Come in with a few policy ideas. I will tell you where the coalition's policy ideas come from - from the fellow who challenged the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. That is none other than the member for Menzies. He is nodding, because he was given policy responsibility. - We were talking about policy development. We were talking about BAS Easy. The point is that the member for Menzies has been given responsibility for policy development by the other side, by the Leader of the Opposition, freeing up the entire frontbench to engage in a campaign of fear and smear -  - I will go on to the late payment system in a moment, but I do observe in relation to the point of order that, today, the President of the United States pardoned a turkey. Now, what I am going to suggest is that the Leader of the Opposition pardons the turkey on the backbench! - We did make a commitment to the late payment system. We will be issuing a report in the very near future, just after the first anniversary of the commitment coming into force. Of course, we need to report on the first year's results -  -  - but I tell you this: when it comes out, you will be very disappointed. You will be very disappointed with the results, because they are very encouraging results - again, another Rudd government election commitment being met on time. So get in line, support small business in this community and pardon the turkey.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I think we would all agree it is very important that Australians are inspired to understand their democracy, inspired by the prospect of serving in public life, whether that be as a member of parliament or in one of our great Public Service agencies, whether that be in my department or in the Prime Minister's department, the ministry of foreign affairs or perhaps even the Electoral Commission.I think we would recognise that there was a sigh of relief from the Electoral Commission after certain events yesterday, because how much public education would it have taken for the 2010 election to be between Kevin and Julia, and Kevin and Julie? It would have been a close election, so close there would only have been a letter's difference in it! One does wonder whether we would have ended up being a nation internationally ridiculed, as people from around the world concluded that every Australian man must be a serious, churchgoing type called Kevin and every Australian woman must be a former lawyer called Julie or Julia! The nation has certainly dodged a bullet as a result of yesterday's events. I do note that we should be praising the member for Wentworth for introducing the name 'Malcolm' into the election, to stop this confusion!I do also note, though, from a Mr Grech email that not everybody is a fan of the current leadership team. Mr Grech did say: 'Agree that MT is doing a good job but he needs to deal with the JB issue.' It seems to me grossly unfair; I won't stand for it! I think the team of Malcolm and Julie is doing very well indeed. But that does not mean that we are holding anything against the member for Menzies, and I have actually bought him a small Christmas present as a token: these pens. I know that he is probably feeling a little bit poorly today, so it is something to remind him of those good old days in the past -  -  -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I will move right along before we start debating censorship laws, which was where that was all going next, as far as I could tell!The reason we are also very fond of the member for Menzies is that he is of course a former race caller, and I think one thing he could do next year now he will not have the burden of leadership on his shoulders is call the 2010 election for us. I have got what I think could be his starting call. 'They're off and racing, and Kevin, on a horse called the Future of Programmatic Specificity, a well-known horse in Rudd Labor politics, is trying hard. And there of course is Malcolm Turnbull on a horse, Future of Global Conspiracies. But Malcolm is struggling because the back half of the horse appears to be trying to go in a different direction, and he is actually trying to chuck a bit of weight off. There are a few fake emails, there is Grech to get rid of, and of course then there are those climate change deniers. -  -  - I am on my way to the final straight, Mr Speaker. Thank you very much on the question of civics education. I say to the member for Mackellar that in this horse race the old horse ain't what she used to be. But moving right on, the member for Warringah is there on a horse called Battlelines. It does seem to be stalking the member for Wentworth but it just will not pass. That might cause a stewards' inquiry at some point of this horse race. The member for North Sydney is riding a clever race but his horse is looking quite tired by now. -  - It is true to say that I have a genetic advantage. I am prepared to pay that absolutely. And of course, the member for Mackellar, apart from making an appearance as a warhorse, could make an appearance on a horse called Infrastructure. She has already got the high visibility clothing, though not wearing it today, but she would always fit in well on a building site. The member for Wide Bay I think would be there. He is still flogging a dead horse called the National Party. We would be able to see him in the race. And of course the member for Sturt would be there in the grandstand, squealing to the Leader of the Opposition, 'Don't frighten the horses!' That is exactly what would be happening.Let me say in the spirit of the season that I wish all opposition members well and I would like to conclude by saying to my old friend the member for O'Connor: I actually do not have a mad uncle in my family, so he is always welcome around at the Gillard family for Christmas and, if he wants to bring his 34 mad mates with him, they are very welcome as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for the first question relating to sport that has been asked by the opposition in two years, and say that some people may know that calendars have not always been my strong point. But just in case there has been any confusion, I am willing to say that the end of the year is indeed the end of the year.On a more serious point, can I also say that the reason that this has come up - and I know that it is the final day of parliament and we can all have a bit of a joke - is because of the serious overhaul of the Australian sport system. We are committed to ensuring that we strengthen Australian sport at both an elite and a community level. We think that this is incredibly important. It is important to the nation, as the government has pointed out, that we are committed to increasing our support at both an Olympic level and at a community level, and we look forward to responding at the end of the year. - It is great to see your Christmas spirit over there. With regard to your question, I am very excited about the upcoming cricket season and I hope to be able to get to both the Boxing Day Test and the New Year's Test, one which will be this year and the other which will be next year. Thank you.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. Indeed, there is a need for order and unity in both chambers of the parliament if the parliamentary processes are going to function properly. As I highlighted earlier today, there have been 191 bills, 191 pieces of legislation, passed through this chamber this year alone - the highest number of bills in a decade, because this government has a big agenda. This would not have been possible without orderly conduct from united government members. This week has highlighted what happens in the parliament when you do not have unity. Now, on Thursday afternoon, we are not quite sure when the legislation will pass the other chamber that has been agreed to by the government and the opposition. We are not sure when it will pass - if it passes. We are not sure by how many votes it will pass or who will be the Leader of the Opposition at that time.Yesterday morning the members for O'Connor and Tangney moved a motion to spill the Liberal Party leadership. It is true that there have been spills over the years on this side of the House as well, but never before has there been a case where the choice was between the Leader of the Opposition and nobody, and nobody got 35 votes. - What happens to the CPRS legislation is very much related to the business of the House It is quite interesting that yesterday 35 people voted for the 'anyone but Turnbull' ticket. I think I know where they got their inspiration from. The member for Tangney was the seconder of the resolution yesterday. If you type into Google 'Copenhagen, Jensen and 35 votes', you actually get an article from the Copenhagen Post dated 19 November 2009 entitled 'Dead candidate gets 35 votes.' It is about Mr Jensen, who was a candidate in an election, and he received 35 votes after -  - What is relevant is getting this legislation carried, and it is quite clear that some of those opposite are determined to stymie the legislation being carried in the Senate and then returning to the House. Yesterday, after the resolution of the joint party room which rejected the leadership spill, Kevin Andrews, the member for Menzies, went out and did a press conference. He was asked:Is your interpretation of the result today that 35 people would have preferred you as leader from here on?He said:Well, I think that is a reasonable interpretation to make.I leave it to those opposite - </DOC>

 - As I said in response to the honourable member's question yesterday, and having sought at the end of question time to obtain advice from the national secretary of the Australian Labor Party, it is as I said yesterday. If there is anything further to add then of course I will. But I can only act on the basis of the advice of the national secretary of the party, as would the Leader of the Opposition respond if he was asked a question about donations to the Liberal Party.I am glad also, though, that the honourable member continues to return to the refrain of campaign donations and campaign finance reform. One of the matters which now lies blocked in the Senate is a proposal we have had there for a long time to reduce the disclosable donation limit from the $10,000 to which those opposite raised it under the Howard government to the $1,500 which we have proposed instead. - As I said in response to the honourable member's question that he asked yesterday, having sought the advice of the national secretary of the Labor Party I responded on the basis of that advice having been received. I have received no further advice, and I would simply say on the broader question of campaign finance reform that if those opposite were concerned about integrity on these questions how can they sit there and take $2.1 million from the tobacco lobby and how can they block campaign finance reform legislation in the Senate? - When the honourable member actually refers to particular amounts of reported donations, she should reflect fully and carefully on the laws the opposition are blocking in the Senate to bring about decent campaign finance reform. That is one of many which are currently lying in the Senate. Those opposite, frankly, are not committed to reform at all. On the question of fundraising, I simply quote, as I believe the Minister for Finance and Deregulation did before, a certain Godwin Grech in his email to, it seems, 'MT' or someone like that:I am also doing some fundraising for MT - he tells me the cupboard is bare. - Mr Speaker, can I suggest that those opposite engage in fundamental commitment to finance reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, which goes to what working families across Australia have been fundamentally concerned about these last two years and that is the state of the economy and its ability to withstand the worst global crisis that we have seen in 75 years. What the government has been doing in that period of time is acting to build a better future for all Australians notwithstanding this crisis - acting through the agency of economic policy, infrastructure policy, skills policy, education policy, health policy, housing policy, pensions policy, Indigenous policy and right across the spectrum of what the government has been engaged in over these last two years.Those opposite have disengaged from the economic policy debate because they know that they have not prevailed in it. As the Treasurer said in question time earlier today, it is because they know they made a fundamentally wrong play in opposing the government's stimulus strategy in February of this year.What we are wrestling with is the worst global crisis in three quarters of a century. What did we have to do? We had to actually step up to the plate and make a difference. How did we make a difference? First of all we provided, for the first time in this country's history, a guarantee for the 15 million bank deposits held by working Australians everywhere in order to underpin security and confidence in our financial system. The second thing we had to do was to engage in the support of the economy through cash payments to pensioners, carers and low-income families to keep the wheels of the economy turning. Thirdly, we invested in a medium- to long-term infrastructure strategy in order to provide continued activity now, supporting jobs, apprenticeships and small businesses today while investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow.As a result, I believe that those opposite and I would think those on the government benches should be proud of the fact that we are out there engaged right now in the biggest school modernisation program in Australia's history. Each and every member - at least on the government benches - is welcoming that investment. Those on the government benches welcome the trebling of the first homeowners boost, they welcome the increase of the special investment allowance for small business from 30 per cent into 50 per cent, they welcome the investments that have occurred in social housing - 20,000 units of social housing - and they welcome also a commitment to the repair of up to 50,000 units of social housing which need fundamental repairs.These are the things in which we have been engaged to make a difference for the economy today. What is our report card, for those opposite, if they are interested in the economic debate? First and foremost, this economy, unlike the other major advanced economies, has so far not gone into recession. Secondly, of the major advanced economies we have registered the second-lowest unemployment. Thirdly, we have done so on the basis of the lowest debt and the lowest deficit of the major advanced economies. Finally, across the 33 members of the OECD, the advanced economies worldwide, ours was the only economy to register positive growth in the year to July this year. This is the report card of what the government has been doing for working families. I would have thought that those opposite would regard this as a reasonable achievement given the challenges we have faced on the back of the global crisis.The other thing we have been seeking to do is to build the economy for the future - to engage in a productivity revolution; an infrastructure investment program, which is led by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government; a skills revolution, which is being presided over by the Minister for Education; and a micro-economic reform agenda through the Minister of Finance and Deregulation and the Minister for Small Business and Competition Policy. It is all about how we create a seamless national market. What is the objective? The objective is to boost long-term productivity growth so that we create the capacity in the economy in the future to deal with the pressures of recovery when they come.Globally what we have been seeking to do is to make sure Australia's economic voice is heard. For the first time in the country's history, what we have actually managed to land is a place for Australia at the top economic table around the world. I would think this is a good achievement for Australia, whichever government happens to occupy the treasury bench in the future. It is a sound an enduring reform for the future.In the process of dealing with these challenges for the economy, we have also been mindful of the fundamental need to build a fairer Australia as well and that is why I would commend the Minister for Education, the Deputy Prime Minister, for her work in bringing about the death of Work Choices as a piece of legislation in this country and instead creating Fair Work Australia to make sure we can provide proper protection for people's penalty rates, their overtime and from unfair dismissal. These are the things which actually make for a decent society, for a fair Australia underpinned by fair and reasonable industrial relations laws.Also we have delivered some $46 billion worth of tax cuts for working Australians. Working families are also benefiting from the increased assistance we are providing to child care, from the introduction of the education tax refund and from our commitment now to introduce paid parental leave for the future. On top of that, we have dealt with the troubles and challenges of times past - delivering, as we should have, apologies to the First Australians and the forgotten Australians - and engaged in the processes of repair and building for the future.This is part and parcel of building a fairer Australia for the future. In preparing for that future, a cornerstone of what we seek to do is to build the education revolution. Again, I commend the Deputy Prime Minister for her work there: the extraordinary investment which is now being undertaken in early childhood education, with our objective of bringing in universal preschool by 2013; a $2 billion investment on the way in computers in school, with some 790,000 computers planned to be landed in schools. On top of that, there is investment in quality teaching, investment in school transparency and investment in extra university places, with a plan to bring about 50,000 more students at our universities, many - most, in fact - from the most disadvantaged areas of Australia. We are investing on a large scale in our universities and TAFE colleges across the country.We have been debating health reform here in recent days, but I simply say to those opposite: we have increased the overall investment in the Australian Health Care Agreement by some 50 per cent to bring it up to some $64 billion, to provide for 212 additional GP training places, to provide for the rollout of GP superclinics across the country and to provide, on top of that, $419 million for a teen dental program.When it comes to fairness for Australians, fairness for all working Australians, we have brought about the single greatest reform to the single age pension which we have seen in 100 years.This is the business of creating a fairer Australia for the future. The government, as we approach this season which involves many important international conferences, must now deal with the challenge which we were elected to deal with two years ago, and that is climate change. The fact that we have now brought about -  - the introduction of the renewable energy target through legislation, the fact that we now have the support of the party represented by the member for O'Connor - the support of those opposite - for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the fact that we have now ratified Kyoto and the fact that we are now active around the global table mean that this government, when it comes to dealing with the challenges of climate change, has not only runs on the board; it has a plan for the future as well.So, whether it is dealing with the strength of our economy against the challenges of the global recession, whether it is building a fairer Australia through the building blocks of pension reform, housing, education, health and dealing with the challenges of Indigenous Australia, or planning properly for the future and climate change - not just pushing it away but getting on with the business of long-term reform and, with other countries around the world, putting together the building blocks for a proper global agreement - this is the proper business of a national reformist government of the type that we have now. This government is proud of the record of its achievement so far. There is much work still be done. We intend to get on with the job.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>
