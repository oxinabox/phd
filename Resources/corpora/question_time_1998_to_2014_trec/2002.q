     Prime Minister, I refer to your earlier answer regarding the United States' decision to apply punitive tariffs on Australian steel.
     Is it not a fact that, even by your own reckoning and your response today, 15 per cent - or $77 million of Australia's $450 million annual steel exports to the United States - will be stopped by the US administration's import restrictions?
     Isn't this almost three times the size of the quota restrictions on lamb imports into the United States, about which your government protested long and loud?
     How can you claim a $77 million cut to Australian steel exports as a victory?

     Treasurer, why did you fail to tell the Australian people the truth before the last election that the funding had actually been taken from the specialist medical outreach service and the asthma management program rather than the health department's existing resources?

    4 million' over four years `for GPs to manage patients with asthma better'?
     And didn't page 11 of the health policy also state that the government had committed `$48.
    4 million' over four years `for greater specialist access in regional Australia'?
     Prime Minister, given that the government had already approved the transfer of $5 million out of these programs to fund Dr Wooldridge's GP House, weren't both of these claims made by you simply untrue because they overstated the amounts by the $5 million transferred to fund Michael Wooldridge House?

     Minister, can you confirm the government has backed down on its previous threat to remove $500 million in unmet need funding from disability services if your cuts of $52 a fortnight to 200,000 disability support pensioners were not passed by the parliament?

     Is the Treasurer aware of the announcement today by the Commonwealth Bank of a record profit of $2.
    65 billion and the net loss of 1,000 jobs over the next 12 months?
     Is he also aware that this result follows announcements earlier this year of billion dollar profits by all other major banks and the release of RBA statistics showing bank fees soared to almost $2.
    3 billion last year?
     With record-breaking profits, bank fees soaring and huge job losses, what action does the Treasurer propose to take to reign in this further example of corporate excess?

     With the sugar industry's deteriorating situation threatening the government's laudable environmental ethanol options, could the Prime Minister ensure that any government bridging initiative via an Ansett workers or dairy farmers style consumer levy does not result in the giant retail chains continuing with or increasing their currently indefensible profit margins -  - I know.
     I think that this is important.
     - wherein a capital NYBOT quoted refined world price of $331 a tonne becomes, in Australia, a retail price of $1,240 a tonne, a 400 per cent mark-up, and in light of a 40 per cent reduction in income to farmers and millers, from $520 to $331, as a result of tariff abolition -  - resulted in a disgraceful 12 per cent rise in price.

    3 million - that is, less than half a per cent of the $306.
    5 million allocated by the Office of the Status of Women in your Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet - actually went to Indigenous family violence and sexual assault initiatives?

     I would also like the Prime Minister to confirm in his statement that there was significant underspending of these moneys in the last financial year, of $4.
    3 million.
     I also understand that one of the reasons for ATSIC cutting its funding back in 1996 was that it lost some $400 million from its budget.

     Is the minister aware that Indigenous unemployment is 23 per cent and that this figure does not include Indigenous people participating in the Community Development Employment Program, an ATSIC-managed Work for the Dole program?
     Is he also aware from recent reports that most of the recent increase in Indigenous employment can be accounted for by increased participation in the CDEP scheme, which has been estimated to account for between 15 and 25 per cent of employed Indigenous persons, and that Indigenous unemployment rates would be over 40 per cent if that scheme did not exist?
     Given these appalling figures, can you confirm, Minister, that federal government departments, including Centrelink, now have a practice of employing Indigenous people not through the Public Service but on the CDEP scheme, which makes them work for their benefits, as we have discovered in a recent answer to a question on notice?
     Minister, can you explain why Indigenous Australians are not given the same remuneration and employment benefits as non-Indigenous employees in the Public Service?

     Treasurer, doesn't Environment Australia already have a 62-page report detailing specific risks to motorists, including, from a long list, the following three: one, perishing and swelling of the fuel system causing hazardous fuel leaks; two, corrosion of metal components; and, three, a seven per cent drop-off in performance?
     Doesn't this document show that the final, second stage of that study is not due to be finished until April 2004?
     Is the Treasurer so keen on protecting the Prime Minister's mates that he will not even think about protecting motorists for another 16 months?
     That is almost four years after his government was first warned of the risks from high ethanol levels.
