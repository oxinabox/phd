     Are you aware that your announcement of a 1.
    5c cut to fuel excise has been completely negated by this week's fall in the Australian dollar?
     Is this what the Treasurer meant in January 1996 when he said:.

     with each fall of the Australian dollar, Australians have to work longer and harder.

     Prime Minister, is it not a fact that you have included in these fact sheets not just the money announced last night in the budget but also the value of the tax cuts handed out in July this year, but that you did not tell anyone?
     In the case of a retiree over pension age earning $35,000 a year, aren't the budget measures worth only $430 of the $1,400 you claimed as a reduction in tax in these fact sheets?
     Haven't you misrepresented your budget package to the media and older Australians, and aren't you just being tricky again?

     -  - Minister, is it not the case that, if the employer had followed your advice to not compromise, the dispute at Tristar would still be running, throwing thousands more people out of work?

    5 per cent of their payroll for an insurance bond which over two years costs $1.
    4 million?
     Isn't it also a fact that under Labor's employee entitlements scheme, employers will be required to pay just an additional 0.
    1 per cent on their superannuation contributions - that is, $23,000?
     Minister, why are you forcing employers to suffer industrial disputes and to pay more -  - when under our plan the scheme will be legislated and employers will pay substantially less?

     - Is it not also a fact that the outcome of this audit will become public only if the Queensland Liberal Party allows it?
     Prime Minister, will you undertake to ensure that your referral of this matter to the tax office will not inhibit full parliamentary scrutiny of the conduct of your ministers and officials?

     Wasn't that untoward?
     You attended a branch meeting the next day where the scam was approved.
     You attended a further meeting on 20 March where the scam was again discussed.
     You were aware of the February accounting advice that said the scam contravened the tax act.

     Minister, I refer to your claim that the Ansett crisis was a mere blip for the tourism industry.

     - Well, I have been interrupted.

     Minister, rather than saying that your job is done, why won't you now work with all the parties for a permanent solution to getting Ansett, its remaining fleet of more than 50 jets and its 16,000 employees back into the air?
     Given that your ticket guarantee expires in the middle of the school holidays, why won't you extend it so that the people who book a holiday with a guaranteed flight out can also have a guaranteed flight home?
     Minister, why won't you look beyond a three-month quick fix that gets you past the election but not past Christmas?

     I refer to his refusal this week to acknowledge the jobs crisis now facing Australian families, calling the loss of 2,000 Coles Myer and Daimaru jobs a `tiny morsel of negative news'.
     Prime Minister, have you seen today's job vacancies survey showing that job vacancies have fallen to a four-year low, down 3Â½ per cent in the last three months and 6.
    7 per cent on a year ago?
     Prime Minister, with part-time jobs at their highest percentage level ever recorded, with the loss of 87,000 full-time jobs in a year, the collapse of HIH, Daimaru, Ansett, One.
    Tel and Harris Scarfe, if this is not enough for you?
     Will these figures today make you wake up to the looming job crisis facing struggling Australian families?

     - My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp.
     Minister, is it correct that direct university funding from the Commonwealth has been cut every single year since the Howard government was elected?
     Is it correct that the number of Australians at university has fallen for the first time since the Prime Minister's beloved 1950s?
     Minister, is it correct that your new school funding system delivers multimillion dollar increases to schools like King's School and Geelong Grammar while public schools get almost nothing - only automatic indexation at schools?
     Minister, do you agree with the Prime Minister that his government has done enough for education and that Australian families are going to wear these consequences for years to come?
