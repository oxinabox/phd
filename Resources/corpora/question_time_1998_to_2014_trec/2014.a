  I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition and I fully share the dismay of members opposite, of members on all sides of this House, at the announcement that Toyota made yesterday. Every single one of us is devastated by this announcement, just as we were devastated by the announcement in December that Holden would cease manufacturing, just as we were devastated by the announcement early last year, under a different government, that Ford would cease manufacturing and just as we were devastated by the announcement back in 2008 - again under a different government - that Mitsubishi would cease manufacturing.                 It is not my intention to play the blame game. I will leave any of that to others. I am confident that the decent, honest workers and the decent, honest businesses of this country can, with assistance from state and federal governments, build a good future. That is our challenge: to get the fundamentals right so that the decent, honest workers and the decent, honest businesses of this country can flourish. And that is exactly what this government is doing.

  I do thank the member for Bennelong for his question. I accept that there is, to be sure, a shadow over this parliament today cast by the announcement by Toyota yesterday that manufacturing operations will cease in 2017. But that announcement, devastating though it is, should not obscure the fundamental strengths of our economy. Last week, Coles, for instance, announced a $300 million investment in Victoria to create some 3,000 jobs, mostly in regional areas. Perhaps the largest manufacturing employer in this country is Boeing, an aircraft component manufacturer which is flourishing even though we do not manufacture aircraft here in Australia. Then there are companies like San Remo, a South Australian, family based, food manufacturer supplying some 60 per cent of Australia's pasta requirements - and it is even exporting spaghetti to Italy.                 I do not for a second minimise the impact of Toyota's shutdown following on the shutdown announcement of Holden late last year and Ford much earlier last year under the former government. But I do want to assure all members of this House and the Australian people that this government will respond intelligently and in a timely fashion to this latest announcement, and we will do so in full partnership with the Victorian government. In particular, we look forward to partnering with the Victorian government to build economic infrastructure in the great state of Victoria - building, indeed, on our commitment to fund and finish the East West Link, which is estimated to create some 3Â½ thousand jobs during its construction phase. That is what the people of Victoria need if they are to face the future with confidence.                 We need to get the fundamentals right. Government does not create prosperity; profitable business creates prosperity. Governments do not create jobs; profitable business creates jobs. That is why we need to get taxes down, we need to get red tape own and we need to get productivity up. That is the way to increase jobs and prosperity in this country. If I would make a respectful suggestion to members opposite: pass the carbon tax repeal legislation and pass the restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill. That way, we will get a fair go for the honest workers and the honest businesses of this country.

  Members of this government, the Treasurer and the industry minister, have been in regular discussions with Toyota. I met with the chief of Toyota Australia in December last year and I assured him that assistance would be available to Toyota on the same basis as it had been available in times past. I gave him that assurance. I told him that, as far as this government was concerned, we wanted manufacturing to continue in this country. I did meet with both Mr Max Yasuda and more senior officers of Toyota yesterday and I did ask them if there was anything that we in government could do to cause this decision to be reconsidered? I regret to announce this to the House, but they said that they had carefully considered the economics of manufacturing in Australia, the costs of manufacturing in Australia, the conditions of motor manufacturing in Australia and their decision was final.                     The Labor Party is desperate to play the blame game in this parliament. I think the Australian people deserve better than that. What the Australian people expect of us in this place is a consistent, serious attempt to get the fundamentals right so that the honest workers and the honest businesses of this country can create the prosperity that the Australian people want, and that is exactly what this government will do.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for her question. I will also comment on her extraordinary hard work in the short time that she has been the member for Corangamite. She constantly represents her electorate with vigour, with enthusiasm and with positivity because she knows as much as anyone in this House the challenges that face industry in Australia. This government recognises that it is an extraordinarily difficult time. We know that as a result of the announcement yesterday the face of industry in Australia will be changed forever. But this transition has been coming for some time and no-one on that side of the House can deny that fact. We are in a competitive market; our dollar has been high. This government, from the day it was elected, began a broad considered response to the industry needs in terms of increasing the value of its production and moving it to areas where we are competitive rather than producing a commodity in a world market where we simply are not able to compete any longer.                 We have set out to review the economies of both Victoria and South Australia and that process has already travelled some distance - in fact, as you know, I was in Victoria three weeks ago and in South Australia last week. We have established a $100 million growth fund to ensure that development goes on in the wake of, particularly, the closures of Holden. We have established a national competitive industry innovation agenda, led by the Prime Minister, along with the Treasurer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the trade minister.                 We do work towards transforming Australian industry but with a precise and measured approach. What we have seen from those opposite in the past, in the last six years, is chequebook diplomacy: see a problem, rip out the chequebook, throw money at it - knowing full well that there is no solution coming from any of that. The changes in industry have been going on for some time. What we need to do is make sure we address the issues that are there, not attribute blame, not lament, not say this is a catastrophe. This is a challenge, and Australians have a record of rising to that challenge. We need to use our innovation; we need to use our wit. We need to make sure we provide opportunities for the workers not only of Toyota, Holden and Ford but all Australian workers, and that we are transitioning this economy to something that is sustainable.

  As I have just said in answer to the Leader of the Opposition's previous question, I met with the head of Toyota Australia in December last year personally to reassure him that, as far as this government was concerned, we wanted Toyota to continue manufacturing in Australia. We wanted to assure Toyota that assistance would be available on much the same basis in the future that it had been made available in the past. I understand that the opposition wishes to sheet this home entirely to the government even though this plainly is something that has been taking place over quite some years now. I know that mere statistics are not of much consolation to people who are facing the closure of their business. But it is a fact that since 2007 motor production in this country has declined by a third. It is a fact that since 2007 motor employment has declined by a quarter.                 We all deeply regret the devastating announcement that Toyota made yesterday. We all deeply lament this. But our challenge as a government, our challenge as a parliament, is not to preserve every single business indefinitely. Our challenge is to create the conditions under which people, if necessary, can transition from good jobs to even better jobs. And I say to members opposite, whose sincerity I do not doubt: is it going to be easier to get a good job with a carbon tax or without a carbon tax? Is it going to be easier to get a good job with a mining tax or without a mining tax? Is it going to be easier to get a good job with businesses at times being strangled by green tape or without that? Is it going to be easier to get a good job with the Australian Building and Construction Commission restored or without it? So these are the questions before this parliament, and I think that the honest workers of this country know who their real friends are.

  I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and I can certainly understand some of his anxieties that were expressed in his question. Obviously all of us have been dismayed by the fact that some 1,000 ballot papers appear to have been lost for the Western Australian Senate election. All of us are dismayed and dumbfounded as to how this could possibly have occurred. But there is, as we know, a case before the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, dealing with, amongst other things, the way the AEC conducted the Senate count and the Senate ballot in Western Australia. There is also a report due from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and I think I would like to wait for that case to be concluded and that report to be delivered before I further comment on the Australian Electoral Commission.

  I thank the honourable member for her question and recognise that it is hugely important for the performance of the Australian economy that the government has control of its budget and it is hugely important that there be bipartisan agreement in trying to ensure that you actually fix some of the structural problems in the budget. So I am somewhat dismayed that, as we go into the new year, there has been no change in attitude from the Labor Party towards trying to repair the budget. You will recall that, in the last few months of last year, the Labor Party not only opposed $15 billion of savings that we took to the election to try and fix the budget; they decided to oppose $5 billion of their own savings that they took to the last election. So the Labor Party were not satisfied with ruining the budget in government; the Labor Party want to do even better in opposition.                 These days I am very guarded about having anything to drink on New Year's Eve, because on 1 January there is always something that surprises you. On 1 January I opened up The Australian and it said: 'Hawke, Keating tell PM to slash spending.' Don't tell him; tell him, the Leader of the Opposition, because he had former Prime Minister Keating go to the caucus before Christmas and he wanted to share his wisdom, the Keating wisdom, about how to fix the budget. To his credit, PJK did in fact fix the budget. He started fixing the budget and then gave up hope and left us with a $10 billion black hole. But he did fix the budget. He had his own commission of audit in the late eighties, and he had a fiscal consolidation, because it had to happen. Then, in 1996, the coalition was elected and it had a commission of audit, and then it had to fix another problem that Labor left behind. So too, just before Christmas, the Minister for Finance and I revealed the true state of the budget left by Labor: $123 billion of deficits over the next four years, and not a deficit to be seen for a decade at least.                     Not a surplus to be seen for a decade at least, but $667 billion of debt. So I say to the Labor Party: don't listen to me; don't listen to the Prime Minister; don't listen to the economists; don't listen to the Australian people. Why don't you listen to Bob Hawke and Paul Keating? They are telling you that now is the time to fix the budget, and it is.

  I do not begrudge any Australian worker his or her wage. I want the Australian worker to be better paid all the time I want the Australian workers' pay to go up and up and up, but I do make this very important point: if the workers of Australia are to be the best paid workers in the world, we have to be the most productive workers in the world as well - and that's the problem. I very much regret the fact that when Toyota just a few months ago sought to talk to their workers about improving productivity in their factory they were denied that opportunity because of the operation of our system. I do not the blame the workers for that. But, you know, there is a certain former union official sitting opposite - there are quite a few former union officials sitting opposite and I have to ask: why weren't the workers of Toyota able to sit down with the managers of Toyota to try to organise to save their jobs and to save their business? Because the Leader of the Opposition's union mates, using the Leader of the Opposition's workplace laws, frustrated that effort, and I deeply regret that.

  I note that the member for Petrie is right to be concerned about the impact of the carbon tax on the competitiveness of his warehouses, on his small manufacturing firms and on his construction firms, and there is a reason why. Members of the House will remember that throughout the term of the last government various members of the ALP said that the carbon tax was only ever going to touch 500 firms. The claim was not just made by the former Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. It was not just made by the former climate change minister, Greg Combet. It was not just made by the former Treasurer, the member for Lilley. It was also made by, amongst others, the now Leader of the Opposition: 500 firms only. So we asked Treasury to do a little bit of analysis for us. Do you know what they found? They found that it was not 500 companies, it was not 5,000 companies, it was not 50,000 companies. It was 75,000 companies that are directly hit by the carbon tax in terms of the fuel tax credit. Seventy-five thousand: just a small, little error! Just a 150-fold error of calculation - nothing compared with the budget difficulties which the Treasurer has to face that he inherited from the other side, but 75,000 firms.                 What are these firms that are being hit? Think for a moment. Aviation: Qantas, $106 million in carbon tax; Virgin, $48 million; Rex Airlines, which described the carbon tax as 'disastrous'; Brindabella, which has gone into receivership. Domestic shipping and ferries; rail transport, whichever state you are in; mining; construction; small manufacturing firms; small warehousing businesses; and anybody using off-road diesel generators have been hit. So that is the reality of the carbon tax. Not 500, not 5,000, not 50,000 but, according to Treasury, 75,000 firms directly hit.                 It gets worse than this, however, Prime Minister, because the opposition's policy is to extend the carbon tax on fuel to trucks and buses. That is still their policy. It would be great to know whether or not you are going to change that policy. But there is a better way than this, members of this House, and that is that in the coming weeks the carbon tax is before the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition can choose to provide relief not just to 75,000 firms but to 10 million Australian households who are paying higher electricity, gas and grocery prices. Now is the moment to take your senators back to work and get out of the way of lower electricity, gas and fuel prices.

  I am happy to assure the Leader of the Opposition that I made no such statement. I made no such statement in the party room or anywhere else. I made no such statement because it is not the case. There were a whole range of factors behind Toyota's decision. Those factors were enumerated to me at different times, including last night, and the sad truth is that the cost of producing cars in this country was simply too high for Toyota to continue. It was simply too high for Toyota to continue.                 I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition wants to sheet all of this home to a government which has been in power for less than six months, as opposed to a government that was in power for six years, but the fact is that 130,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared under members opposite. Motor industry production declined by a third; motor industry employment declined by a quarter; Ford announced their departure; and Mitsubishi did depart - under members opposite.                 Let us not dwell on the past. Let us not play the blame game, which the Leader of the Opposition is so desperate to do. Let us ask ourselves this question: what should this parliament do to make it easier for jobs to be created in this country? What should this parliament do to try to ensure that businesses can flourish in this country? And let us ask the question -                      Are jobs better protected with a carbon tax or without one? Are jobs better created and protected with a mining tax or without one? Are jobs better protected without an Australian Building and Construction Commission or with one? I say again: I think the workers of Australia know who their real friends in this parliament are.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and note his own long history in the police force in Victoria, where he was very much at the forefront of the fight against criminal gangs in that state.                 The Australian community has been aghast over recent years, but particularly in recent weeks, at the stories that are emerging from whistleblowers, like this one in TheAge on 29 January 2014, 'Threat to kill whistleblower'; stories that have been appearing about standover tactics, standover merchants, the links between the CFMEU and bikie gangs and criminal elements; and stories about death threats, extortion, thuggery, kickbacks and corruption. And they are right to be aghast at these stories because of the damage that is being done to productivity but also because of the threats to law-abiding Australians by unacceptable behaviour from criminal bikie gangs and from the union elements that are out of control.                 It is time to bring the rule of law back to building and construction sites around Australia, similarly to the way that the previous Liberal government did when it established the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which the next government, led by Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd and the then Minister for Workplace Relations, the now Leader of the Opposition, dismantled. He dismantled the Australian Building and Construction Commission, but there is a way to address this issue.                 We have legislation before the parliament right now to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and to establish a Registered Organisations Commission, and we have announced a royal commission into union governance and corruption, all of which the Leader of the Opposition could support and all of which he is opposing. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he cannot rise above his background. He is a union official supporting union officials. He is running a protection racket for a protection racket.                 But he would say that he has a solution, because recently he said these words:                 In a signal to the union movement that there could be a limit to his support, the Opposition Leader said he would call on the union leadership to ban the wearing of any bikie colours or badges by union members _ on worksites.                 So he is taking a tough stand on what the bikies wear at the worksites across Australia! He is not prepared to take a tough stand on thuggery and corruption and the behaviour of union leaders, but he is absolutely determined to make the bikies, when they turn up to the workplaces, take off their colours. They must be shaking in their boots at the prospect of the Leader of the Opposition being back in charge! If he were serious, he would get out of the way of the government. He would support the ABCC, the ROC and the royal commission into union governance.

  What the company assured me last night - and I am sure that, if the Leader of the Opposition had met with Toyota last night in this building, he would have had the same assurances - is that the jobs are not going tomorrow. They are not going next week or next month or even next year. These jobs will finish in 2017. I deeply, deeply regret that, but the important thing is to create the conditions in our economy where those workers can move from good jobs to better jobs, and that is exactly what this government will do.                 As I said, we are going to get the fundamentals right. We are going to get rid of the carbon tax. We are going to get rid of the mining tax. We are going to restore the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which created $6 billion worth of productivity improvement in this sector. We will support the East West Link, which will create 3,500 jobs in its construction phase. So I ask the Leader of the Opposition what is his position on East West Link. Does the Leader of the Opposition support East West Link? If he supports it, he supports 3,500 jobs. If he does not, he is against job creation in Victoria.

  The member is correct: it has been more than 50 days since there has been a successful people-smuggling venture to arrive in Australia. Not one successful venture has made it to Australia in the last more than 50 days under the working policies of this coalition government. In this year alone, in 2014, there have been no single ventures that have successfully arrived, and that compares over the same period of time to last Friday to 14 boats and 798 people that turned up this time last year, which was also a monsoon period. The message is certainly getting through. During the course of the past week I had occasion to be in Malaysia, where I was able to be informed that people are now starting to make their way back up the chain; it is reversing. They are going back up the chain from Indonesia to Malaysia because they know that the way to Australia is closed under this government's policies. Further, I happened to be in a displaced persons camp in Rakhine state of Myanmar on Sunday and in that camp I was told by those who are in the camp that they know of the policies of this government and that those policies are working and the way to Australia is closed under this government.                 Those opposite I would have thought would have welcomed the fact that this government is stopping the boats. Maybe it is that they just do not know what border protection success looks like, because for six years they certainly did not get a glimpse of it in any way, shape or form. But this government is going to keep doing what we have been doing. I know those opposite are going to keep opposing what they know works, because of the shame of their border protection failure. We are going to continue to deny permanent residence to those who have arrived illegally by boat, which Labor and the Greens continue to combine in the Senate to try and oppose. We are going to continue to run offshore processing the way it was designed, not the mess that was left to us by those opposite. We are going to continue our policy of regional deterrence, working with our partners in the region like Malaysia to ensure that people do not come down that chain. And we are going to continue to intercept and remove vessels that seek to illegally enter Australian waters, as has been the practice of this government. We are going to keep doing that because that is what we promised the Australian people we would do. That is what we are doing. It is getting results. I call on those opposite to support rather than consistently trying to frustrate and undermine the policies they know are working and they never had the strength to implement.

  Again I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to members opposite, and indeed to all Australians, that I want the workers of this country to be amongst the best paid workers in the world. If we are to be the best paid workers in the world we need to be amongst the most productive workers in the world. I welcome the efforts that the new management at SPC Ardmona have made to restructure their business, and I congratulate the member for Murray for her support for the workers and management at SPC Ardmona.                      I do. What they have done since new management were installed early last year is that new product lines have been developed, a very good and innovative thing. Since new management were installed early last year new markets have been developed at home and abroad, a very good thing, and I welcome that. I also say that they have made a start to ensure that the workplace is as well managed as it could be, and I welcome that. One thing this government is not going to do, though, is simply hand over $25 million in borrowed money to a highly profitable company that made $215 million in after-tax profit last year. We are just not going to do it. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, surely he is not saying that the taxpayers of Australia should have borrowed $25 million to have given it to a company that made $215 million after tax in just six months. That would have been real business welfare and this government does not support that.

  I thank the member for McMillan for that question and acknowledge his long history of volunteering for the CFA in Victoria. He will understand the sorts of efforts that firefighters and volunteers are going to in his electorate and the electorates of other members in Victoria and South Australia at the moment to battle what is a significant bushfire emergency. And we thank them for it.                 Over the weekend, dozens of bushfires burnt across south-eastern Australia. More than 26 bushfires continue to burn in Victoria alone, and in South Australia firefighters are working to stop the Bangor fire reaching towns in that area. Sadly, these communities are very familiar with the ferocity of bushfires, and our thoughts are with those whose homes have been destroyed or damaged.                 I have again been in contact today with the Victorian Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Kim Wells. In Victoria alone more than 6,000 firefighters from across Australia and New Zealand have been mobilised, and they are supported by widespread aerial support. To assist impacted communities, individuals and families, Minister Wells and I have announced jointly-funded assistance for emergency accommodation, food, clothing, personal items, and personal and financial counselling. We have also announced the establishment of emergency re-establishment grants, which will assist towards the clean-up, repair and replacement of household contents for residents whose homes are now deemed unfit for habitation. Assistance is also available to local councils to respond to the fires and in cleaning up and repairing essential public services.                 In addition to this, the Commonwealth contributes $14 million for firefighting aircraft in the states and territories. Seventy aircraft are currently being deployed in Victoria, and the beauty of the national aerial firefighting arrangements is that aircraft are placed all around the country and then deployed where they are needed to deal with particular emergencies.                 Twenty-one homes have been confirmed destroyed in Victoria, although that figure will certainly be significantly higher once we know the full extent of the damage. Heatwave conditions continue to be forecast across south-eastern Australia over the coming days, with temperatures expected to increase towards the weekend. I would urge all communities impacted by the current fires to make preparations for their families, houses and businesses and listen to their local radio for advice from emergency management authorities.                 National cooperation in responding to bushfire emergencies is deeply impressive. The Commonwealth works seamlessly to provide whatever assistance the states need, and cooperation between states is also very extensive. As always, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist the Victorian and South Australian governments with whatever they might need.

  I would like to thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question on what is a very important issue. The member for Eden-Monaro would know better than most the benefits of dairying in his area, and the member for Eden-Monaro would know better than most the costs of dairying that are currently being inflicted on his people.                 In Eden-Monaro, about 100 farmers produce 125 million litres of milk a year and export that to around 40 countries. You might be interested to know that their carbon tax bill is $660,000 a year. Of course, one of the best ways to try and start helping the farmers of Eden-Monaro would be to repeal the carbon tax. But we have carbon tax deniers over on the other side, and of course they do not want to do that because that would actually give money back to the farm gate. But it is not only that. We have about 250,000 tonnes of hardwood woodchips that go out. We have about 250,000 tonnes of softwood. We have about 25,000 cubic metres of sawn logs that go out. Of course this is all part of the regional forest agreements, which, because of the Labor Party's close arrangement with the Greens, are always, continually, under threat. They are continually attacking the industry of Eden-Monaro. But there is a better place to be, and under the coalition we are looking at a white paper. That white paper will look into the future of agriculture. It will deliver for agriculture a real path into the future. I am proud to be part of a government that actually has it as one of its central pillars, its fifth pillar. It is going to be great to be part of and work with the member for Eden-Monaro to actually deliver a path forward for the people in agriculture.                  I am looking forward to working with issues such as drought at the moment, as we try to come forward and look after the people in drought. But we also have a vision for the long term. What the Labor government in the past delivered to us was nothing more than an affliction. They shut down the live cattle trade. That was one of their piece de resistances. They shut down the live cattle trade. There are also abattoirs in that area - and, of course, what do the abattoirs get hit with? They get hit with a higher power bill. Why? Because of the carbon tax. It is not just the dairy processing factory itself that gets hit. It does not matter what the dairy farmer does on their place. If they turn on the kettle, they are going to pay the carbon tax. If they listen to the radio, they pay the carbon tax. If they buy steel from an Australian steel mill they pay the carbon tax. If it comes in from overseas, of course, they do not, because the carbon tax is only to afflict Australian industries. It aim was to attack Australians. What we intend to do is take that cost away from them.

  I should not blame the Leader of the Opposition for the construction that he put on the statement I made at the Garma Festival last year, because some people did put that construction on it, but what I actually said -                      What I actually said was that the first remote community that I would visit and stay in as Prime Minister would be a community in East Arnhem Land, and that is exactly what I am going to do. I will spend a week in East Arnhem Land later in the year. It will be the first remote Indigenous community that I visit in this way as Prime Minister. I am very much looking forward to it. I am very, very much looking forward to it because, amongst many other things, Galarrwuy Yunupingu has been one of the fathers of Indigenous advancement in this country, and I was particularly honoured that he was so keen, up at the Garma Festival, that East Arnhem Land should be the first Indigenous community that I volunteer in as Prime Minister.                 As for the refinery at Gove, like the Leader of the Opposition, I deeply regret the decision that Rio Tinto have made to close that refinery. They have made that decision because the refinery is uneconomic. They have made a commitment that the Indigenous workers will all be found work in the mine that will remain open and operational. My understanding is that they are hoping to provide alternative employment to all of their other workers at the refinery.                 Without wishing to be too partisan about this, but given that the Leader of the Opposition has chosen to raise it in this way: if the Leader of the Opposition were as concerned as I believe he is, he might have a word to his senators about passing the carbon tax repeal legislation.

  I thank the member for Brisbane for her question. I can point out to her and the House that, while the government has only been in office for five months, a good start has been made. We inherited from the former government unemployment that had gone up by 200,000 over six years. We inherited from the former government a situation where their loss of control of the borders had led to more than 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat. And of course, under the former government, debt was skyrocketing towards $667 billion.                 I can report to the member for Brisbane that the new government is stopping the boats. We are fixing the budget. And we are building a future where every Australian can expect a fair go and every Australian will be encouraged to have a go. That is the kind of future that we are building. We have sensible savings before the Senate - $15 billion worth of savings for which we sought a mandate at the election, including $5 billion worth of savings for which Labor sought a mandate at the election, so you would think, would you not, that members opposite would facilitate the passage of those savings. We have the carbon tax repeal legislation, the mining tax repeal legislation and the Australian Building and Construction Commission restoration legislation similarly before the Senate. All of these things were put before the people at the election, and we have a mandate for them.                 As part of being open for business, the Minister for the Environment has given approval to new projects worth a potential $400 billion, and I thank the minister for his work. As part of being open for business, the Minister for Trade has successfully negotiated a free trade agreement with Korea, which will be very good news for Australian agriculture as well as being good news for Australian consumers.                 We said we would stop the boats, and it has now been 55 days without an illegal boat arrival on our shores. That gives the Australian people great confidence that border security can be re-established. But part of building a safe and secure Australia is closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous outcomes. As I reported to the House today, there is still a long way to go but great progress has been made. I would like to be an infrastructure Prime Minister but I would also like to be known as the Prime Minister for Indigenous affairs.

  Let me inform the member that my first week in a remote community as Prime Minister will be in East Arnhem Land. My first week in a remote community as Prime Minister will be in East Arnhem Land, and I suggest that the member should quote the sentence or two that came before the sentence that he quoted to this parliament. For the benefit of members opposite, let me repeat: my first week in a remote community as Prime Minister will be in East Arnhem Land. I am looking forward to going. I am looking forward to meeting with the traditional owners and with other Indigenous leaders led by Galarrwuy Yunupingu. It will happen later in the year and I look forward to meeting while I am up there anyone who feels that the federal government can be doing more to help. What I intend to do is as far as is humanly possible be a Prime Minister for all Australians. I can understand why the people in Nhulunbuy are unhappy, why people involved in the Gove refinery are feeling disappointed. But I have spoken on a number of occasions with Rio Tinto about this and, as I said, the assurance I have had is that the Indigenous workers at the refinery will be offered new employment in the mine and that as far as is humanly possible every worker at the refinery will be offered redeployment within the Rio Tinto business.

  I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. As members would be well aware, today the Prime Minister delivered his Closing the Gap report for 2014 and he announced that we would be attempting to end the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in terms of school attendance within five years and that would be added as one of the targets of the Closing the Gap program initiated by the previous government.                  As the Prime Minister said this morning, no-one has ever received a good education by not turning up to school. Upon coming to government we have moved quickly to try and address the issue of school truancy but also meaningful education at school that keeps bringing students back every day. In the Northern Territory alone, my cabinet colleague Senator Scullion tells me that 13 per cent of Indigenous students attend less than 80 per cent of the time that they should be at school. That makes it virtually possible for them to achieve the same outcomes as non-Indigenous Australians. So we have moved quickly. We have allocated $28.5 million to employ 400 school attendance officers in 40 communities in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. Early signs since the beginning of this year's school year show an increase in attendance from 60 per cent to 90 per cent in those communities, which is a tremendous result. Let us hope we can continue that throughout the year and into the future.                 Once we get children to come to school, we want them to be taught meaningfully. Last week I was in Bamaga and Injinoo at the top of Cape York with the member for Leichhardt and visited school communities there. What has been most transformative in that school community has been a focus on phonics teaching through explicit instruction. Over the last five years that was the first school in Queensland to adopt explicit instruction. Their NAPLAN results between 2008 and 2013 have dramatically improved. And while I do not have time to go through the results in this answer, they are startlingly good. That is why we intend to expand direct instruction, explicit instruction and phonics into more rural and remote communities, particularly Indigenous ones, through a $22 million program, the details of which will be announced over the coming weeks, to give a meaningful education to Indigenous children when they present at school and to keep them coming. Through these measures, we will not only reduce school truancy but also improve the outcomes of students and start to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in terms of school attendance and outcomes.

  I thank the member for the question. It might surprise the member for McMahon that we are unable to turn the economy around on a two-bob piece. We have to actually get through our legislative program, which actually helps to build a stronger economy. The best thing Labor could do is to help us repeal the carbon tax. And the best thing Labor could do is to help us repeal the mining tax. And the best thing Labor could do is to help us fix the budget. And the best thing Labor could do is to help us pay down the $123 billion of deficit that is Labor's legacy. And the best thing Labor could do is to prevent this country from ending up with $667 billion of debt, thanks to the largesse of Labor over the last six years. That is going to create the jobs. Lift the burden off business if you want to create jobs. The Labor Party does not understand: it is not the government that creates jobs; it is business that creates jobs, it is enterprise that creates jobs, it is small business that creates jobs.                     You've got to love the chutzpah of the Labor Party. They have got nothing else. They left us with an unemployment rate that is rising to 6Â¼ per cent. They left us with a deteriorating terms of trade, they left us with an economy that is slowing below trend growth, and now they complain about their legacy.

  Thank you very much for the question. I am astounded, because it is the first question I have actually received from the other side, so I would like to thank the member for Indi for the question. It is a good question, because it is about research and development. The Commonwealth each year delivers about $700 million in research and development. About $250 million comes from my department alone. We made an announcement through the budget that a further $100 million over the forward estimates will be delivered, and that will roll out from 2014-15. It is very important, because research and development goes to the crux of how we expand our industry. As a former member of the Rural Research and Development Council - correct me if I am wrong - you would be aware of the report that says that we get $11 return for every $1 spent. It is those sorts of returns that, in our history, have seen us deliver things such as pink lady apples, the rust-resistant wheat that Farrer was instrumental in and that allowed us to develop blacksoil plains, the stump-jump plough - to help us get through the Labor Party! And then there is Droughtmaster cattle, and the Cactoblastis moth - there are so many things you can do with a smart country that actually invests.                 And we do invest. But who used to remove investment? CSIRO lost about $63 million through the Labor Party. And what I also might say is that we have seen some reports that confuse the issue between research and development and subsidies. Research and development are not subsidies. And when we hear reported that $63 million goes into the grains industry for research and development, that is a good investment, when you have $7Â½ billion coming back from grains.                     The member for Indi would be aware that it is in the budget, and it rolls out from 2014-15, and it is $100 million over the forward estimates. This gives us the capacity to build on the $250 million a year that comes from my department alone, the $700 million that is already part of the Commonwealth's investment through other organisations and other entities, such as the CSIRO. This is all very important because that is why we can invest $19 million in dairy and get a return of about $2Â½ billion. This is the smart country that we wish to stand behind, because that is how -

  I thank the member for Moore for the question. I recognise that he knows, as I know and now the Australian people know, that Labor left behind deficits of $123 billion. On the estimation of the Treasury, the budget would never have got to surplus under Labor. The only way to repay debt is by having a surplus. The Labor Party's legacy is $667 billion of government debt, unless we can get the budget back to surplus.                 We have not mucked around in trying to address this. One of the first things we did was to introduce legislation to repeal the mining tax and all its associated expenditure. The Labor Party's great benchmark legacy of incompetence was the multitude of designs associated with the variations on the mining tax. How incompetent could you be in designing a tax that raised on average $20 per person over the last three years but has $700 per person of expenditure over the next four years associated with that revenue? Only Labor could introduce a new tax that leaves the budget worse off. That is the peak of incompetence, and they met it last term. They all have to accept responsibility.                 What did we do? We came into this parliament, said we were getting rid of the tax and we have to get rid of the expenditure associated with it. We have to take the hard yards, and that starts on our turf. We made those decisions. We went to the electorate and said, 'We're sorry, Australia, we had to get rid of the schoolkids bonus.' We said that not because there is any ideological satisfaction in it, but because we knew that it was unfair to burden our children with the debt of handouts to parents today. Every dollar that goes out is borrowed from our children. The bottom line is: Labor does not care about that, but we do. We care about intergenerational debt.                  The Labor Party are now opposing $20 billion of savings that are sitting in the Senate. It gets worse every day, because the longer those savings are delayed, the less opportunity there is to repair the budget now. Labor do not care about the future. They do not care about the future at all, and that is why they do not care about deficit and debt. That says everything about the Labor Party.                 Economy

  I want to thank the member for Durack, because the member for Durack represents an export electorate - an electorate which produces minerals, energy, crops and, in particular, livestock. She knows that competitiveness is absolutely essential, in this global environment, to creating and maintaining jobs. So, against that background, when you see that a particular firm is faced with a $250,000 bill - that is $19,000 a month plus GST - just for the carbon tax, you have to ask yourself: how does this create jobs; how does this help competitiveness; how does this help Australian exports; and how does this help Australians maintain the ability to be competitive?                  The answer is that what we see from Derby Industries at Talloman is a very simple proposition. They are hit with the carbon tax through their electricity bills. But abattoirs around the country are not just hit with that; they have to pay the carbon tax through their electricity bills but they also have to pay the carbon tax through the direct emissions. They pay the carbon tax through gas; they pay the carbon tax through diesel generation; they pay the carbon tax through refrigerants. Do you know what - if the Leader of the Opposition gets his way they will also pay the carbon tax on their trucks, because every time they drive their goods to market or from the processing centre, under his proposal there will be a carbon tax on trucks. We are waiting for the esteemed Leader of the Opposition to say whether or not he still stands by a carbon tax on trucks, because that is his policy.                 Beyond that, it is not just this one abattoir; it is also abattoirs such as Master Butchers -                      in the electorate of Port Adelaide, where the Chief Executive Officer, Warren McLean, said, 'The carbon tax has cost this business over $330,000 in higher electricity and gas costs in 2012-13.' This equates to a whopping $15,000 per employee in the member's own electorate.                  Against that background let me be absolutely clear. There is a $7Â½ billion tax break to help improve competitiveness, which we can give to Australian companies. Right now that tax break is before the Senate. Right now the Leader of the Opposition has his senators on an industrial go-slow. It is an area of expertise! If the Leader of the Opposition wants to help he should send his senators back to work and repeal the carbon tax.

  The report, as it related to the content of the discussion between myself and Toyota, was correct. Toyota's statement today is also correct. Toyota did not blame the unions because, at that time, Toyota still wanted to say in Australia.                     They wanted to stay in Australia. You talk about the front page of the Australian Financial Review. Here is the front page you should be looking at. It says, 'Toyota demands IR reform.' Remember when Max Yasuda went onto the Australian Financial Review in 2012? Courageously, Max Yasuda, a Japanese chief executive, went on the front page of a national newspaper in Australia and said, 'We need IR reform to maintain our business.' I table that document. If IR was not an issue in relation to Toyota -                      In their November submission to the Productivity Commission review of the automotive industry, Toyota identified four key requests in relation to their business in Australia. No. 4 is industrial relations. I table that.                  On 10 December, seven days after I met Toyota, I spoke in this place, before Holden had even announced they were leaving Australia. I will quote myself from Hansard, because I was pretty good on that day!                   The member for Parramatta then left the chamber.                     I said:                 They have gone to their employees -                  that is, Toyota -                  and said, 'We need to have this deal go through to help to manage - just to manage - the cost of employment in Australia so that we can go back to Tokyo and say to them in good faith that the workers of Australia really do want a manufacturing business.' So the best thing the Labor Party can do is put aside the politics and ring up its mates at the AMWU and tell them to accept the deal being offered by Toyota, which will give them job security.                 So yes, on 10 December in this place I raised industrial relations, which followed that meeting with Max Yasuda on 3 December.                     My comment in this place on 10 December confirms what was said to me on 3 December.                     Listen! And on 11 December I said it again in this place. I went through the agreement between the AMWU, the workers and Toyota management and pointed out that Toyota was gravely concerned that, if they had to close over the Christmas period, it would put pressure on their ability to supply the market in the Middle East. Now, what happened on 12 December? Have a look at Toyota's release on 12 December after they lost the court case to the AMWU, which says:                 The proposed changes -                  from Toyota -                  were designed to remove outdated and uncompetitive terms and conditions that make it difficult to compete with other Toyota plants throughout the world.                 Get your facts right, Labor, and maybe you will understand that they tried to stay in Australia and it is partly the responsibility of your mates.                   The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.

  I thank the member for Forde for this question, because Beenleigh abattoir is in his district. Beenleigh abattoir can process up to 1,400 head per day and has in excess of 800 people - working men and women - who support the local economy. Beenleigh abattoir is part of a group which employs in excess of 2,000 men and women of this nation and has to pay tax - apparently, the omnipotent bodies on the opposite side can single-handedly change the temperature of the globe! - and this is costing them in excess of $920,000 a year. If the  Labor Party can charge us to change the temperature of the globe then I want them to make it rain. That would seem fair enough.                  This is what we have to do. It is not just the direct costs; it is the fact that electricity prices are going up and that gas prices are going up, but part of his question is very important: what are we going to do about it? We are going to scrap the tax. We are going to get rid of the tax. We do not deny that the government has changed. We believe that the government has changed and that, therefore, the process must change. When the Australian people asked for a change in government on the mandate that we scrap the tax, you were supposed to respect the result, but of course, you did not. So we are still dealing with the anomaly that they believe that $920,000 is what you have to pay for the privilege of employing in excess of 2,000 Australian men and women.                  Maybe one day you would like to go to the food-processing sector to have a look at what these people do, to see how they are growing an industry. You may like to realise how we have a great future in the beef industry because one of the other anomalies which we had with their side - and it is also associated with the beef sector -  is that Labor were the geniuses who shut down the live cattle trade. Overnight they decided that we would no longer export to one of our major partners. Our solution, for the member for Forde, is that we are going to get rid of the tax because we do not believe, as you do, that we can single-handedly change the temperature of the globe.

  I thank the member for Swan for his question and I note the great support that he gives to the students and staff at the Bentley campus of Curtin University.                 I am delighted to confirm that the coalition government is delivering on its election promise to establish a student scholarship scheme, the New Colombo Plan, which will give undergraduate students an opportunity to study at universities in our region and undertake work placements and internships. This gives expression to our foreign policy focus on our region.                  The pilot program for the New Colombo Plan was launched last December, and today the Minister for Education and I are announcing the first round of student grants for placements in the first semester of 2014. This year, more than 300 Australian undergraduates, from 24 universities across Australia, will be undertaking studies and work placements in the four pilot locations of Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Japan.                  The member for Swan will be interested to know that 10 engineering students from Curtin University will be undertaking studies at universities in Indonesia and work placements with leading Indonesian companies and global companies operating in Indonesia in telecommunications, mining, engineering and geophysics. In fact I had a great conversation yesterday with Foreign Minister Natalegawa about the enhanced opportunities for student exchange between Indonesia and Australia. We will also have students studying in the agricultural sector, particularly focussing on the beef sector, which will be an important engagement with Indonesia.                  There are other opportunities for the 300 students that will be in this first tranche. Australian medical students will be undertaking clinical placements in Singapore. In Japan there will be internships in state-of-the-art technology companies. In Hong Kong Australian students will be studying business and Chinese language at universities. Later this month the second tranche applications will open. The applications for the prestigious 12-month scholarships are already open.                 In 2015 we hope to roll out the New Colombo Plan across the region. Our vision is for a two-way student exchange. Already the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is managing about 4,400 inbound scholarships. The New Colombo Plan will comprise the outbound component, and this will give rise to our vision for deeper engagement in the Asia-Pacific.                 I want to place on record our thanks to: Her Excellency the Governor-General for agreeing to be the patron; the New Colombo Plan reference group, chaired by the Secretary of Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; vice-chairs, Kevin McCann and Sandra Harding; Kate Duff and the team at DFAT; the NCP secretariat; the staff at the education ministry; and the opposition for their bipartisan support for ensuring that the New Colombo Plan is a success.

  I thank the member for Pearce for his question. He has a keen interest in these issues, particularly in managing issues around the Northam centre. A commitment was made by the coalition before the last election, and that commitment is being honoured. It is being honoured despite the frustration of those opposite, because what we are doing is cleaning up the mess on our borders that was left by those opposite.                  The key contributors to that mess I still see sitting on the frontbench of the opposition. I still see them there. We have got the member for Gorton, who was responsible for 12,500 arrivals. We have the member for Watson, the Manager of Opposition Business. He was only there for two months, but he was responsible for almost 5,500 arrivals. Of course, the daddy of them all was the member for McMahon. The member for McMahon, who wanted to come to the dispatch box and remind us all about records in this very question time, was responsible for 25,000 arrivals in 400 boats. It was the member for McMahon who left me the boats and it was the member for McMahon as Treasurer who has left this Treasurer the budget with a deficit of over $120 billion. If there is a gold medal for ministerial failure - in multiple portfolios, as we know - it is the member for McMahon, particularly so in immigration.                  This government is going to continue with the policies that are working, despite the opposition that continues to come from those opposite. That opposition extends to them continuing to try and deny this government the reintroduction of temporary protection visas, which has been core coalition policy for over a decade and is part of a suite of measures that we know stops the boats. We took it to the election, we had the mandate of the Australian people and they have sought to deny and frustrate that in the Senate by teaming up with their partners in crime, the Greens, when it comes to border protection policy failure.                  We know what happened when they got rid of temporary protection visas when they were in government. We know that 800 boats turned up, we know that 1,100 people perished at sea, we know that there were 8,000 children who turned up on boats after they got rid of temporary protection visas and we know that they handed out 15,000 permanent visas to people who turned up illegally by boat. They think the best message to send to people to not come to Australia is to give 30,000 permanent visas to people who arrived illegally on boats on their watch. This government does not agree with that. This government is going to honour its commitments that are stopping the boats and implement the measures that they did not have the strength to implement.

  Like every other member of this House, I am conscious of the ABS statistics released earlier today and I very much regret the fact that unemployment is edging up. This is bad news. None of us like it. All of us must do what we can to prevent it. I do make two points, though. The first point is that, in the last economic statement released by members opposite when they were in government, unemployment was projected to rise to 6Â¼ per cent in the first half of this calendar year. So what has happened is that unemployment has done what members opposite said it would do under their own policies. Unemployment has done what the Labor Party said it would do under Labor's policy. Members opposite can hardly blame this government for the consequences of their own policies.                 Members opposite created the problem and we on this side of the parliament are fixing it. That is what we are doing. Every single policy, every single measure that this government has put in place since the election, is designed to make it easier for businesses to create jobs. Whether it is taking off the carbon tax, whether it is taking off the mining tax, whether it is restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission, whether it is giving environmental approval to $400 billion worth of new projects, or whether it is actually concluding negotiations for a free trade agreement with Korea - every single measure that we have put in place is designed to create jobs. That is why the workers of Australia know who their real friends in this parliament are.

  I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and I welcome her commitment to getting on with job creation, particularly in Western Sydney. We have a plan for Western Sydney. We have a plan for Australia. It means stopping the boats. It means fixing the budget. It means building the future. It means creating an Australia where everyone can expect a fair go and everyone is encouraged to have a go. That is the kind of Australia that this government is creating.                 We have only had five months. We have made a good start, but we did inherit a mess: 50,000-plus illegal arrivals by boat under the border protection disasters of members opposite; a Commonwealth debt skyrocketing toward $667 billion because of the policies of members opposite; under members opposite unemployment queues were 200,000 people longer when they finished than when they started. Two hundred thousand extra unemployed Australians were the legacy of members opposite after six years in government. There was Mitsubishi, which closed down under them. There was Ford, which announced it was departing under them.                 They created the problem; this government is fixing it. Members opposite created the problem; this government is fixing it. We have $20 billion worth of savings before the Senate because governments, like businesses and households, have to live within their means. That is $15 billion worth of savings that we took to the election plus $5 billion worth of savings that members opposite took to the election, and they are opposing all of it, even the savings that they took to the election. We have legislation before the Senate to abolish the carbon tax and to abolish the mining tax. Abolishing the carbon tax alone will add almost $1 trillion to our GDP over the next few decades. We will restore the ABCC. That will add $6 billion in productivity improvements every year in that industry. There are $400 billion worth of environmental approvals thanks to the new minister. There is a Korean free-trade agreement negotiated thanks to the Minister for Trade. And there is WestConnex, funded to the tune of $1Â½ billion under this government.                 Everything we are doing is designed to make it easier to create jobs. That is what we mean when we say Australia is under new management and open for business.

  Like the Leader of the Opposition, I am dismayed that unemployment went up last month. But this can hardly come as a shock to the Leader of the Opposition because the Leader of the Opposition was a senior member - the minister for employment - of a government which forecast that under its policies unemployment would hit 6Â¼ per cent at about this time. How can the Leader of the Opposition protest against a development which he forecast would happen under his policies?                 The Leader of the Opposition says where is our plan. Our plan is to get rid of the carbon tax; his plan is to keep the carbon tax. Our plan is to get rid of the mining tax; his plan is to keep the mining tax. Our plan is to restore the Australian Building and Construction Commission; his plan is to keep running a protection racket for a protection racket.                 I do not say that the 200,000 increase in unemployment under the former government was all the former government's fault. I do not say that the 80,000 increase in unemployment when the member opposite was the employment minister was all his fault. I do not say that the 130,000 jobs that disappeared in the manufacturing industry when members opposite were in power was all their fault.                     What I do say is that they made a bad situation worse with their taxes and their regulations and that is why we are getting rid of them.

  Thank you to the member for Wannon for the question. I recognise the role that he played to ensure that the transport needs of Victoria are well and truly on the governments agenda as we plan our infrastructure projects for the term ahead.                 He and others in his area would already be starting to notice the fact that there are significant road projects under way or announced and about to begin for those areas. Let us look at projects like the Koonda spur road, the Great Ocean Road, the Princes Highway west, the Western Highway - some of those in the member's own electorate.                     I am looking forward to seeing a number of those projects when I visit the member for Wannon in his electorate tomorrow for the Warrnambool field days. It will be great to see this government in action and developing and delivering on its commitments. The Australian government has committed $6Â½ billion -                      We have a range of commitments worth $6.5 billion that we included from Victoria on our infrastructure program.                     That will help pick up some of the slack that was left to us by a government that was all talk but very, very little shovel. The facts are that the biggest of those projects is the $1.5 billion contribution -                    The member for Ballarat then left the chamber.                     If she goes home, she can drive on the Western Highway and the Princes Highway and she can drive on the Great Ocean Road - all projects that this government is committed to deliver.                     This is an example of a government that is about delivering results in the country.                   The member for Grayndler then left the chamber.                     I could give him a list of New South Wales roads he might like to drive on, which this government will be delivering, roads that have been left behind and that he failed to deliver but which we are committed to make happen.                   The member for Adelaide then left the chamber.                     On top of those projects I have already mentioned, we have a commitment to the Black Spot Program, Roads to Recovery and our new bridges program.                     This is a government that will get on with the job of building the infrastructure of the 21st century and making a real difference to the people and the economy of Victoria, making sure that our country grows.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, but I make this fundamental point in response: how can the Leader of the Opposition complain when unemployment does what Labor said unemployment would do under Labor's own policies? I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to Labor members: you created the problem, this government is fixing the problem and you should stop obstructing the fix. That is what should happen.                 The Leader of the Opposition has asked me about a business in Western Australia which has gone into receivership and where jobs will be shed. This is a tragedy for the workers of that business - absolutely no doubt about that. But I ask this question of the Leader of the Opposition: is it going to be easier for mining businesses to flourish with a mining tax or without a mining tax? Is it going to be easier for mining businesses to flourish with a carbon tax or without a carbon tax? The truth is that the carbon tax and the mining tax are anti-Western Australian taxes. They are both daggers aimed at the heart of the Western Australian economy. The government wants to repeal them. The Leader of the Opposition wants to stop this.                     He says, because he cannot shut up -                      that he asked about Forge. He says, because he cannot keep quiet, 'What about Forge?' Well, the best thing we can do for the businesses that the workers of Forge depend on for their jobs is to unshackle them by repealing the carbon tax and repealing the mining tax. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you are serious and fair dinkum about this, get out of the way and let the cure be put in place.

  I thank the member for his question, and I presume that he and the Leader of the Opposition are on a unity ticket on this, as they are on so many other things. The Greens oppose the East West Link. The Leader of the Opposition likewise opposes the East West Link. I have two pieces of information for the member and, indeed, for his collaborator the Leader of the Opposition.                   The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                     I assume that the Leader of the Opposition has been given a document from the Victorian government, the published business case, stating that there will be $1.40 of value for every $1 invested in the East West Link. The other point I make to the Leader of the Opposition, who is so concerned, and to the member who asked the question: if the Leader of the Opposition is as concerned about jobs as he claims, and as I believe deep down he is, he will support a project that will create almost 3,500 jobs in its construction phase. He will support that. I am quite happy for support for the East West Link in this parliament to be a litmus test. Who is in favour of jobs in Victoria? Those who support the East West Link are in favour of jobs in Victoria. Those who are not, like the Leader of the Opposition and the member who asked the question, are against Victorian jobs.

  I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. He recognises, like the IMF recognises, that we have been left with a significant economic challenge. The IMF report recognises that the government has inherited a significant budgetary problem. Labor left behind $123 billion of deficits and, if no remedial action is taken, $667 billion of debt - a huge amount of money. The fact is: they left us with a growth rate less than three per cent, which is the trend growth rate for Australia. And they left us with rising unemployment. In many ways that is the most devastating of the indices. If Labor were re-elected, unemployment would be going up to 6.25 per cent on their own pre-budget data.                     That is right. It is no surprise under Labor.                      You'd still have a car industry if Labor was re-elected? Is that right, Bill? The last six years never happened. I know that this chant that you are entering into today is part of the therapy of being in opposition, but let me tell you: at some point you have to deal with reality, mate. The reality is that Labor cannot wipe away the last six years. They cannot wipe away the last six years on unemployment. They cannot wipe away the last six years, five of which had below-trend growth. They cannot wipe away $123 billion of deficits and they cannot wipe away $667 billion of debt. But I will tell you what: they can help us to wipe it away; they can help us to deal with it; they can help us and back our plan. And our plan is about getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax, getting the budget back into shape and putting in place a sensible industrial relations regime, including the reintroduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. These things are not easy but they must be done. If you do want to create more jobs, if you do want to bring down the unemployment rate, the economy has to grow faster. It has to grow faster. You cannot just click your fingers and expect it will happen. It has to come from changes in this place and the Senate. And those changes are our plan. They are our plan to get rid of the carbon tax, to get rid of the mining tax, to free up the labour market. And do you know what? Smaller government is bigger enterprise, and it is enterprise that creates jobs.

  Let me say this. The member for Robertson is right to be concerned about puffed up electricity bills. The member for Robertson is right to be concerned about overinflated electricity bills. And the member for Robertson is dead right to be concerned about the effect of dodgy electricity bills on families and jobs. So she is also right when she quotes the New South Wales Treasurer, Minister Baird, who said:                 If Federal Labor would now get out of the way and allow Tony Abbott to abolish the carbon tax, price relief for NSW households in 2014 _ would be around 10 per cent _                 So the New South Wales government is absolutely right, and when you look around Australia the same applies. The Australian Treasury has estimated that the average electricity bill across the country would go down by nine per cent if the Leader of the Opposition were to allow his senators to move out of the way and abolish the carbon tax. Gas prices would go down by seven per cent. Household bills would go down, on average, by $550. So when you look at the carbon tax you look at an electricity tax.                  What is the impact of that electricity tax? At the moment, the Clean Energy Regulator is preparing the final calculations for the cost of last year's carbon tax. It is likely to be close to $7Â½ billion. The electricity component alone is likely to be close to $4 billion - in the case of Macquarie Generation: a $900 million electricity bill and a $1 billion asset write-down which could have delivered infrastructure for New South Wales; in the case of Victoria, $1.3 billion of electricity bills; if you go to Queensland, $800 million of electricity bills; and if you look at Western Australia, $200 million for the primary generator there. These are real and significant bills right now which are having an impact on families and businesses.                  If the opposition is concerned about jobs and competitiveness, the cost of doing business is fundamental. And right at the heart of the cost of doing business is the price of gas and the price of electricity and the impact of electricity bills. Against that background, there is a moment in time over the coming weeks when the opposition can stand up for Australian jobs and do something that matters. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: your senators are on an industrial go-slow right now. Put them back to work, vote for repeal of the carbon tax and get out of the way of lower electricity bills.

  If the Leader of the Opposition didn't hog so many of the questions maybe some of his fellow frontbenchers would get some practice at asking a question!                  One was a grant for tourism infrastructure; it had nothing to do with the business as such. The other was a request for $25 million from the taxpayer from a company whose parent had made $215 million in after-tax profit in the last six months. One was local tourism infrastructure. The other was business welfare, from a company with a better balance sheet than the Commonwealth of Australia.                 I am delighted that we have seen some announcements from SPC Ardmona today - I really am. I want to thank all the people in this House, all the frontbenchers, everyone in this House on this side of the parliament, including the local member, who have been wishing well this great institution. We said SPC Ardmona had a good future, and it does. We said that it did not need $25 million from the Commonwealth, and it does not.

  I thank my neighbour from the shire, the member for Hughes, for his question. I know he is interested in an update because just before Australia Day he relayed to me the story of when he was at the railway station at Holsworthy and a commuter returned at the end of the day and was quite pleased to learn that at that stage there had been 36 days when there had been no successful people-smuggling venture to Australia. I can update the member today: you can tell your constituent from Holsworthy it has now been 56 days since there has been a successful people-smuggling venture to Australia. I can understand why your constituent on that day was so pleased, because he had been waiting for a very, very long time to be able to get that sort of news about successful border protection policies. There is still a long way to go in this operation, but the truth is these policies are getting the results they were designed to get.                  The great shame is: these were the policies we implored those opposite to restore, year after year after year. The captains of border chaos that still litter the front bench of the opposition, who were responsible for that chaos, had the opportunity to restore those policies, and we now know those policies are the policies that are getting results.                 I want to acknowledge in this place here today those who are responsible for getting those results, and that is the men and women who serve as part of Operation Sovereign Borders, who are implementing these policies and getting the results. We believe they should be appreciated.                  Members opposite believe they should have an inquiry into them. The member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Isaacs called for a public inquiry into the service of those men and women in Operation Sovereign Borders and the unsubstantiated and outrageous allegations against our Navy. It is amazing that they are happy to call for an inquiry into unsubstantiated sledges against our Navy, but, when it comes to a royal commission into union rorts and slush funds, that is something they oppose.                  When it comes to the issue of border protection, they could have implemented our policy, and they chose not to. Nothing has changed. The challenges are just as difficult today as they were six months ago. The people who can implement them are the same today as they were six months ago. The push factors are the same today as they were six months ago. I will tell you what has changed: there is a government that believes in strong border protection policies and has the will to implement those policies and has the strength to continue with those policies in the face of the opposition of those who sit opposite.

  I welcome the question from the member for Dobell, who is a very good member who replaced a very bad member in the seat of Dobell at the last election. It is particularly apposite for the member for Dobell to ask this question about royal commissions, because the royal commission that we announced on Monday into union governance and corruption will go to the heart of issues like slush funds in unions - slush funds like the one conducted by the Health Services Union, which was represented as national secretary by the former member for Dobell.                     I understand the sensitivity of the Labor Party on this issue, because the Health Services Union has given $1.2 million of its members' money to the Labor Party since 2007, like the CFMEU, which has given $5 million of its union members' money to the Labor Party since 2007. They have fallen a bit more quiet, because they do not like the public to know -                    The member for Gellibrand then left the chamber.                   The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                      and they certainly do not like workers to know that the Health Services Union and the CFMEU, both of which will be the subject of this royal commission, gave between them over $6 million of their union members' hard-earned money to the Labor Party to keep them in government from 2007 and to dismantle the Australian Building and Construction Commission to ensure that it was defanged and then eventually abolished and replaced with a tiger that was so toothless it was unable to even prosecute if two parties had agreed and settled a matter, in spite of it being criminal or civil activity.                  I am not surprised at all that the Labor Party is sensitive about this answer, but it is worse than that, because the Leader of the Opposition continues to stand in the way of the royal commission, the re-establishment of the ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission, which would address the issues to do with slush funds and corruption in the union movement.                 I know that the Leader of the Opposition spent some of the summer in Paris, where he obviously picked up his latest idea to crack down on the unions at workplaces around Australia, because he came back from Paris and said he would attack them with the fashion police. He would make sure they did not wear their colours on worksites if they were bikie members and union members. He got some very good ideas from his trip to Paris, the fashion capital of Europe, because he returned and unveiled this startling policy to strike fear into the hearts of union members. We want to put a tough industrial cop on the beat; he wants to put the fashion police on the beat. He believes that the best way to attack union thuggery is by exposing it in the pages of Vogue magazine. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he will never rise above his background.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. As he knows very well, there are many Australians in regional and remote areas for whom fixed-line broadband services are simply not practical and a satellite service is the solution. There is a real role for government to play in providing that. Under the Howard government, the Australian Broadband Guarantee provided just that. It provided an equipment subsidy. So it did not come as a surprise, I suppose, that in 2010, ahead of the final long-term satellite solution of the NBN, the Labor government announced that it was spending $351 million on an interim satellite solution.                 This is probably the worst example of misspent and mismanaged funds in the whole NBN saga. At the outset, Senator Conroy said that there were 165,000 premises eligible, but he did not buy sufficient services to enable 165,000 premises to get a service. In fact, he only bought 48,000 services. So he promised it to 165,000 but could only get 48,000. And then - in what can only be described as the Labor government's departure from the real world of Australia and entry into its own fantasy world of Conrovia - at the beginning of 2013, in a press release, the NBN Co announced that the number of eligible customers for the broadband satellite had increased to 250,000, so it had gone up. They had changed the eligibility, but of course nothing had been done to improve the service.                 The tragedy of this is that not only are there tens of thousands of people who cannot get the service but were told they could; the quality of the service is now little better than dial-up. Under the old Broadband Guarantee, we required ISPs to ensure that people got 65 per cent of their peak speed 80 per cent of the time. No such guarantee was given and no such restriction or rule was made, and as a consequence of that we now have the situation where the 48,000 lucky people who got the service are getting a far inferior service to what they got under the Howard government Australian Broadband Guarantee - three times the subsidy, Labor spent on this, and for a fraction of the service level.

  Thank you very much to the member for Capricornia, who is a great local advocate for people who need health services. When we came into government, we knew that Labor hailed the GP Super Clinics Program as one of their great successes in health, and I thought: 'Well, I should look for some examples. I should look to see the great successes of the former Minister for Health, the member for Sydney.' I was speaking to the member for Capricornia, and she happened to mention this particular instance, and I thought, 'We should get some detail.'                 Do you know that, to her credit, the former health minister announced this GP superclinic on 10 August 2010? It was a $7 million commitment of taxpayers' money to this GP so-called superclinic. But the problem was that it took 643 days for the former government to put pen to paper to sign the actual funding agreement. The former health minister says that this program drove her crazy, even though it was one of her greatest achievements. Do you know that today, here we are in 2014 and we know that there has been not a patient seen, because there is no building? There are no rooms for the doctors to practise in.                     It is a virtual clinic, as Labor would have it.                 The Labor government wasted billions and billions of dollars. At a time when the Medicare levy only raises $10 billion yet the Commonwealth spends $62 billion on health; when medical services 10 years ago cost us $8.1 billion and yet today, having gone up by 124 per cent, are costing us $18 billion a year; and when we know that Alzheimer's, for argument's sake, has gone up by 170 per cent, Labor still decided to waste billions of dollars on these stupid programs when they should have been spending it on patients and the sorts of services that delivered outcomes for Australian people who deserve elective surgery and who deserve the sorts of services that they could not get under Labor.                 There are many, many examples of the way in which Labor wasted money. We were elected to clean up Labor's mess. We will do it in health, and I will make sure that this government gets money back into front-line health services so that we can help the ageing in our population meet the health needs that they have in the 21st century. I will make sure that we clean up the billion-dollar mess that Labor blew on e-health. I will make sure that we clean up this superclinic program. That is because I want to make sure that we get the health needs right for the Australian people in the 21st century.

  I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. He understands the importance of the strategic and economic relationship with the United States. In fact, our strategic alliance with the United States is, as former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said, our bedrock, the guiding principle of Australia's engagement with the region and the world. In economic terms and taking into account two-way investment stocks and two-way trade in goods and services and the impact of the free trade agreement that we have with the United States, it is also our most important economic partner. One trillion dollars in investment stocks is unparalleled in our history and the $630 billion of US investment has helped underpin the development of critical infrastructure in mining and resources and agriculture, not only in Western Australia but across the nation. It has enabled us to export record levels of commodities to Asia, particularly to China, which is now our largest and most important two-way merchandise trading partner.                  These are facts, and successive leaders on both sides of the parliament have acknowledged this. For virtually every Labor leader from Curtin to Gillard and Rudd, this has been an article of faith. Labor leaders have consistently prioritised the United States relationship. Take Gough Whitlam's words in Washington in 1973. He was speaking about our many relationships. He said, 'Undoubtedly the most important of those relationships is the American connection, many sided, deep and enduring.' Kevin Rudd more recently as Prime Minister said, 'There is no more important relationship for Australia than our relationship with the United States of America.' Kevin Rudd again said, 'Our relationship with the United States is Australia's most important relationship.                  So I was rather surprised to find that there has been a change in Labor's foreign policy and they are walking away from this bipartisan position. Apparently Labor senator Sam Dastyari is now articulating the view that to reaffirm as I did the strategic and economic importance of the relationship was a diplomatic stumble which was guided more by a misplaced sense of Australian identity. The one and only Labor leader who has ever up until now rejected the importance of the US relationship was Mark Latham. He said it was the last manifestation of the White Australia policy. His insulting and reckless commentary was rejected by the Australian people, but it seems that the Latham doctrine lives on. We should not be surprised that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition could not even bring herself to stand as a matter of protocol when the 43rd President of the United States addressed this parliament. Seriously, the Leader of the Opposition should know better than to embrace the regressive Latham doctrine.

  I thank the honourable member for the question and recognise that he recognises that the G20 finance ministers' and central bank governors' meeting in Sydney next week is very important. I want to recognise that the member for Lilley and the member for McMahon both attended previous G20 finance ministers' meetings - in the case of the member for Lilley, quite a number of them. The G20 was at first at its best as a finance ministers' meeting, out of the ashes of the Asian financial crisis. Then it became a leaders' meeting, after the real impact of the global financial crisis. Now it is a finance ministers' meeting held five times a year, and Australia is the chair of the G20. The G20 is the 20 largest economies in the world, representing 85 per cent of the world economy and 75 per cent of the world's trade. In Sydney next week the world's economy is going to be focused on that meeting. It will be at times a difficult meeting. There are going to be discussions about the impact of the US's tapering and what that means for currencies around the world. For a lot of Australians it seems quite remote, but the fact is that the currency has a big impact on many Australian businesses, as we have seen this week. Therefore it is a discussion not only that we will participate in but, as chair, we will lead. I refer you to the Prime Minister's outstanding speech in Davos earlier this year. It was lauded by chief executives and finance ministers and other leaders around the world for its direction.                  The Australian Prime Minister wants the world to focus on getting rid of unnecessary regulation, on reducing taxes, on growth through freer trade, on a fairer taxation system, on empowering business to get on with the job rather than expecting governments, which are cash poor, to do the heaving lifting. That direction, which the Prime Minister stated in Davos for the G20, is going to reverberate around the world and around the global economy over the next 12 months and beyond. We are going to facilitate that with the G20 finance ministers next week. It is a long way to come to Australia for a meeting. The fact that every key finance minister and central banker in the world is coming to Sydney next week to discuss the world economy says a lot about what we can lead and the way we can take the world.

  I welcome the question from the member for Ryan, who I know is an enthusiastic advocate for independent public schools and one of the new ambassadors for independent public schools. On Monday last week, I announced an initiative for independent public schools of $70 million to encourage the states and territories to work with the Commonwealth so that 1,500 more public schools can become independent public schools by 2017.                 Our policies are unashamedly about putting students first in education, about standards and about quality. All the domestic and international research into education indicates that the more autonomy a school enjoys, the better the outcomes for the students. That is why we are pursuing independent public schools - so that students get better quality education and better results. This is virtually a bipartisan policy or it has been in the past. The member for McMahon wrote in Hearts &amp; Minds:                 Western Australia, with the support of the federal Labor government, has taken some tentative steps towards more independence for its public schools.                 In fact Julia Gillard, when she was the Minister for Education, said:                 _ Today in Western Australia, as a result of our resources and reforms, more than 30 state schools are now called independent public schools, _                 Another Labor figure said:                 A report released today on the Labor Government's Empowering Local Schools initiative shows positive progress in engaging parents in school decision-making and improving learning opportunities _                 _Â Â Â _Â Â Â _                 More than 900 schools across Australia are working to increase their authority through an initiative to give school principals more power to make local decisions.                 He went on:                 _ schools that enjoy greater local school authority in relation to resource allocation tend to show better student performance than those with less autonomy.                 Guess who said that, Madam Speaker? You are so smart, I do not even need to ask you to guess. I know that you would know it is the current Leader of the Opposition when he was the Minister for Education in July 2013. Somewhere along the line he had a Damascene conversion, a phrase that he would remember, and he decided to oppose independent public schools. He said they would create a two-tiered system. Do you know who else opposes independent public schools and calls them a two-tiered system? Again, Madam Speaker, I do not need to ask you to guess. It is the Australian Education Union.                 So, unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates time and time again that he is simply a union official speaking for union officials. He cannot rise above his background. He is running a protection racket for a protection racket, only in this case he is hurting students' outcomes. He should get behind our independent public schools model because, if he did, he would be putting students first.

  Of course I stand by all the commitments that this government made prior to the election. If there is one lesson that members opposite should have learnt from the experience of the previous term of parliament it is that you cannot say one thing before an election and do the opposite afterwards.                 Let us never, ever forget the former Prime Minister's statement prior to the 2010 election: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' What did we get? After the election, in order to save her job, she broke her commitment to the Australian people. In order to win the support of the Greens member of this parliament, in order to stay in government, she broke a solemn pledge. Unlike members opposite, if this government says something, it means it. We will keep our commitments.                 It is interesting, is it not, that members opposite are trying to stop us from keeping our commitments, but we will, one way or another, keep our commitments. It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition has talked about cuts to health and cuts to education. The only government that, in recent times, has cut health and cut education is the government in which he was a senior minister.                 The former minister for health is saying it is not true. The former minister for health cut $1.6 billion out of public hospitals. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2012-13 cut $1.6 billion out of public hospitals. What kind of parallel universe are members opposite living in? Conrovia comes to health policy; Conrovia comes to education policy. The former minister, now Leader of the Opposition, cut $3.9 billion out of education. He is shaking his head. He has a terrible case of amnesia. Dr Gillespie, please attend to this man!                 The Australian people want a government that is competent and trustworthy. The test of a trustworthy government is: does it keep its commitments? And we will.

  It was a terrific opportunity to visit the member for Corangamite's electorate last week to meet with the learning centre at Belmont, attend a roundtable hosted by the Torquay Early Learning Centre and meet with the Surf Coast Shire. Things have changed in the electorate of Corangamite. We now have a connected, energetic, community based member. It was a delight to spend the day with her, but I heard the same message there as I have heard across Australia. Sadly the legacy of the previous government was revealed in a report released last week. This report told us that childcare costs in long day care centres have gone up 50 per cent and for most families that is an extra $70 a week.                 That is what we have inherited, but we have a plan. We have launched our Productivity Commission inquiry. Submissions closed last week and we will have a draft report in July.                   The member for Charlton then left the chamber.                     We will have a final report in October. Things are moving quickly and I want to reassure the three-quarters of a million families who took their children back to child care last week - many of whom are struggling with rising costs and are unable to take up the careers they would like to have to meet their needs because they cannot find affordable child care near them - that we have already acted to cut red tape in concert with state and territory ministers. I look forward to the outcome of our Productivity Commission review. I thank the shadow minister for making a submission to the review and helpfully telling us all the problems in the childcare landscape at the moment - she is not in the House today. Isn't that an admission of all the things she failed to fix when she was childcare minister in the Labor government?

  I do deeply regret the job losses at the various businesses that the Leader of the Opposition has mentioned. I deeply regret them. Our plan to create jobs and to boost prosperity starts with scrapping the carbon tax. It starts with scrapping the carbon tax; it continues with scrapping the mining tax. It goes on with restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It goes on with reducing red and green tape. This is what we need in this country if we are to create the jobs - the secure and sustainable jobs - of the future. That is our plan.                 What is the Leader of the Opposition's plan? The Leader of the Opposition has consistently opposed everything - everything - that this government has tried to do to create jobs. The Leader of the Opposition's plan is to keep the carbon tax: a $9 billion hit on jobs. The Leader of the Opposition's plan is to keep the mining tax - again, an anti-Western-Australian tax. The Leader of the Opposition's plan is to oppose the restoration of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, because the problem -                      with this Leader of the Opposition is that he cannot transcend his background as a union official.

  I thank the member for her question. The government's plan to build a strong and prosperous economy does start with scrapping the carbon tax. Scrapping the carbon tax will be good for jobs, it will be good for businesses and it will be good for families' cost of living, because the carbon tax is a $9 billion a year hit on jobs. It is not surprising, given the fact that this is a $9 billion a year hit on jobs, that unemployment is 110,000 people higher now than it was in July 2012, when the carbon tax was introduced.                 The carbon tax, even on the former government's own figures, is a giant handbrake on our economy. Members opposite know, because their figures said so, that our economy by mid century will be $1 trillion smaller - a cumulative $1 trillion smaller - with the carbon tax than without it. It is as though Australia were to close down for a year because of members opposite and their carbon tax.                     Every single Australian's gross national income per head will be $5,000 a year less with a carbon tax than without one. That is a $5,000 a year hit on every Australian's income that this opposition wants to maintain in perpetuity.                 Scrapping the carbon tax right now would make every single Australian household, on average, $550 a year better off. That is $550 a year better off, thanks to scrapping the carbon tax. Scrapping the carbon tax will give industries like the aluminium industry a fighting chance not just to survive but to flourish. The Labor Party's own figures show that, by mid-century, under a carbon tax aluminium production will be down by more than 60 per cent. So, every time an aluminium plant closes or scales down, it is just the carbon tax doing its job.                 I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition is now visiting workplaces where jobs are at risk; I am very pleased that he is doing that. But if he wants to help those workers rather than just use them, he will get out of the way and he will let the carbon tax repeal legislation go through.

  I think the workers of this country do not want talk; they want action. That is what they want. My job as Prime Minister is to fight in this parliament for the policies that will help those workers and that will enable those businesses to have a fighting chance of surviving and flourishing - and that is what I am doing every day. As Prime Minister I am doing what I can in this parliament to remove the taxes and the regulation and the industrial lawlessness which are damaging the job prospects of these decent Australian workers. That is what I am doing, and I will do that as long as there is breath in my body.

  I thank the member for Higgins for the question and recognise that she came along to a number of meetings over the weekend. There was a meeting of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors. It was the first significant ministerial meeting under Australia's presidency. At the end of the meeting Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, described Australia's presidency as 'action oriented'. That is exactly what the Prime Minister promised at Davos earlier this year - that we would have a presidency of the G20 that would be focused on getting on with the job of building infrastructure, creating more jobs and repairing budgets. It is so vitally important not just for the world but also for Australia that we focus on structural reforms to create jobs. Only through structural reforms are we going to increase the speed of growth in the economy.                 The heavy lifting on economic growth cannot be left to central banks, be it in Australia or anywhere else in the world. Easy monetary policy is only a temporary source of growth. The only way you can have economic growth is to earn it. You have to earn it, and it only comes through structural change in economies to cope with the changing nature of the global economy. That is why, out of the weekend and for the first time ever, G20 finance ministers laid down on the table a number - a real ambition - for the next five years to increase global growth by over $2 trillion. That is tens of millions of new jobs across the world. It is the first time it has happened. Why has it happened? It has happened because every country in the G20 recognises that only through structural reform are you going to grow the economy and create jobs. I was wondering what the reaction of the Labor Party would be. I love the member for Wills. He said this morning on the doors, 'Growth is not an end in itself. I heard over the weekend that Australian adults have grown by six kilograms in recent times and this is in fact a recipe for diabetes and heart disease so it is not a good thing.' I guess I have been in 'recession' for the last 12 months, haven't I? Oh dear, growth is not a good thing. This is the man who was the Labor Party Parliamentary Secretary for Trade and for Schools - keep him away from the kiddies if he is going to give them that for an economics lesson.

  I thank the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development for her question. I do remind her and the House of the scale of the fiscal challenge that members opposite have left us. Under the policies of the former government, we would get $123 billion in cumulative deficits over the forward estimates period; and, under the policies of members opposite, debt was skyrocketing towards $667 billion with $123 billion in accumulated deficit. So there is a big challenge, and we will address it in ways consistent with our pre-election commitments.                     Yes.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. As the honourable member is aware, the rollout of the NBN in Tasmanian essentially stalled in July, and very little work has been done since then - in large part because the contractor, Visionstream, was not prepared to continue working for the rates it had previously agreed to. Since then the NBN Co under its new management has had extensive negotiations with Visionstream. Work has resumed already on 17,000 premises and is shortly to begin on another 19,000 premises, all of which are expected to be complete comfortably within this year. So we would, if that occurs - and we expect it will - have more premises passed with fibre by the NBN Co in Tasmania in this year than were under six years of the Labor government.                 The honourable member is concerned, as we all are, about people who have cancelled their service - for example, their Telstra service - in anticipation of the NBN Co connecting them at the time that the NBN Co said they would. So they were told by the NBN Co, 'We will connect you on such and such a day,' and those people cancelled their Telstra or Optus service. Then the NBN Co did not turn up on time, missed appointments and so forth, and those people were left in the lurch. This is a real problem. As the honourable member knows, this has been going on for some time. This is not something that has occurred since the election. He asked me what we are doing about it.                 We have changed the approach the NBN Co has to rolling out its network. Previously, it was totally focused on meeting numbers in its corporate plan and passing premises so as to tick that box without regard to whether those premises could actually be activated. That is why there are so many thousands of premises - roughly a third - which are in so-called service class zero and which cannot be connected at all. We are focusing now on activation, and the new chief operating officer, Greg Adcock, is very focused on actually delivering what it should. The object is to get people connected, so we are very alert to it. I can give the honourable member an example of some early progress. He will note from the rollout figures we publish every week that the premises passed in Tasmania have not materially increased since July although they will start o ramp up now. But the number of premises which are connected and which have a network termination device on the premises has increased by 50 per cent.

  I thank the member for Barker for his question and recognise that, over the weekend, G20 finance ministers spoke about the challenge of ongoing deficits. It was Korea who said that they are going to have a surplus this year. Korea is going to have a surplus this year. Germany has been running surpluses since 2012. I remember when Wayne Swan promised a surplus. I do not remember when Labor last delivered a surplus.                     That was 1989 - the year of Roy. The fact is that Labor left us with a $123 billion deficit and debt approaching $667 billion. They made spending commitments that had no money behind them. That was the way that Labor ran the budget.                  I turn to that oracle of wisdom about economic policy on the Labor side, the member for Wills. I want him to be on the doors every day. He said this morning:                 What we need are economic objectives such as low unemployment, low inflation, low interest rates and a balanced budget. They are the things that people could get excited about.                 I want to be at his home for a dinner party on a Saturday night - 'They are the things that people could get excited about.'                 As for low unemployment, the member for Wills should be asking his colleagues why, after just six years in office, they left the unemployment rate 200,000 people higher - 200,000 higher than what they inherited. As for low interest rates and low inflation, you do not have to worry about that too much when you have five out of six years of below trend growth - which is what Labor had. But how about this: there he was on the doors talking about a balanced budget. This is a new concept for Labor - a balanced budget. He said that that is what the people can get excited about. I say to the member for Wills: instead of going to the doors in the morning, why don't you walk down the corridor and go into the Leader of the Opposition's office and just ask him why he is opposing $20 billion of savings in the Senate. Five billion dollars of those savings are what the member for Wills promised to introduce at the last election. You promised to introduce those at the last election and now, like complete A-grade hypocrites, Labor are now opposing their own policies to fix the budget now they have gone into opposition. Do you know the great lesson of opposition? You have to have consistent principles - and I hope the Leader of the Opposition is going to learn that.

  Before I answer the member's question, I am sure he would join me in expressing condolences to the family of Mr Berati. I offer those condolences on behalf of the government and myself for that tragic death that occurred at the Manus Island centre last week.                 In relation to the question put by the member: as he would know, as a former minister that morning and over the course of that night I took several reports, verbal and otherwise, regarding what had occurred that night. What happens in these situations, as ministers previous opposite will know, is that information can be patchy - and it is rarely perfect on those first occasions. I reported the information I had as of that morning; and, later that afternoon when I returned to Canberra, I received further briefings and I gave a press conference where I stated quite clearly the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Berati - known as 'the deceased' at that time. I said:                 In terms of the man who died, he had a head injury and at this stage it is not possible to give any further detail on that, including now, based on subsequent reports, where this may have taken place.                 On the afternoon of that very Tuesday, I further qualified the report I had given that morning. Over the course of that week I received further briefings, and I dispatched my deputy secretary and General Campbell to Manus Island. Over the course of the weekend, on Friday night and on Saturday, in particular, I received further information that made it very clear that it was important to make a further correction to that earlier report. Information is never perfect in those circumstances. Over the course of that week I conducted five press conferences to update people on what was occurring at that centre. What occurred was a terrible tragedy.                  The other point I would make about what occurred on that night is that, despite that terrible tragedy, the centre opened the next morning and it continues to operate today. That centre is an important part of our overall suite of border protection policies. I would not describe it as the cornerstone of our policy; I would describe it as an important part of our policy. It is the part of our policy that has been most successful in ensuring that, for 64 days and counting, we have had not one successful people-smuggling venture to Australia has been principally what we have done at sea. We stand by all of those policies, because those policies are stopping the boats and they are saving lives.

  I thank the honourable member for the question and for the privilege of being with him in his electorate during the break. It was good to see and talk about some of the important infrastructure projects that this government has planned for Wannon and the neighbouring electorates.                  The member would also know how important regional aviation is for so much of country Australia. People who live in regional communities depend on aviation not just to get to other places in the country or around the world but also for many of their basic services, such as health, education and the professional services they need in their community from the people who fly in to provide those services. Alternatively, country people so often have to go to the cities to get the health care and other things that they need. So the aviation industry is very, very important to regional Australia. It has been an industry facing significant competition and, obviously, high cost. It is a difficult environment.                  However, since the carbon tax was put in place, the cost of regional aviation has increased dramatically - 6c a litre added to the cost of aviation kerosene and 5c a litre added to the cost of avgas - and that puts up the cost of operating aviation right across the country. We all know that regional aviation companies have been reporting declining profitability. Sharp Airlines in the member's own electorate -                      reckoned that this tax is costing them $400,000 a year, money that they find very difficult to recover from their passengers, and of course it also affects their profit margin. Rex have talked similarly about declining profit projections.                  There is something that this parliament can do to make regional aviation more competitive and that is get rid of the carbon tax. If the opposition is serious about jobs in this country, then it should be voting to get rid of the carbon tax. It is a job-destroying tax. It is a service-destroying tax. It is a tax that tears particularly at regional communities because they have to pay such a significant share. So when members opposite talk about the need to look after Qantas and Virgin and the other major airlines, there is something that this parliament can do right now. The Senate should vote to get rid of the carbon tax that will tear hundreds of millions of dollars out of the cost structure of our airlines, to make them more profitable, to enable them to employ more people and to provide better services for the people of Australia.

  I am happy to answer, Madam Speaker. I advised in my previous answer that on Tuesday afternoon I received a further briefing and I reported on that afternoon that there were conflicting reports. That is what I said on Tuesday afternoon. Over the balance of the week, I received further information and on Saturday I received information that made it clear that it was essential to correct the record, which I did on Saturday.                     There will be a formal review into these matters and that formal review will investigate all of the issues that relate to this incident. That would include how this centre was specified and who set it up and how it was set up. It will go into the performance of the service contractors that those opposite contracted. It will go into the security arrangements that were put in place and left to the opposition when we formed government.                     It will go into all of those matters, and it will go into my conduct and the conduct of those on this side and our handling of these issues since we took over responsibility for these centres. We identified that there was a $1.2 billion funding black hole for the operation of the offshore processing centres.                      That is the figure from MYEFO. The shadow Treasurer interjects opposite that it is not the right figure. Maybe he has trouble counting, but there was a $1.2 billion funding black hole that went to issues such as security infrastructure and the size and capacity of the centre.                  I know those opposite will be concerned about the specifications and arrangements they put in place in Manus Island. The Manager of Opposition Business once boasted that he could build a 10,000-man camp on Manus Island. I just shudder to think how something like that could have been run safely on Manus Island.                  But we on this side of the House, and I as minister, took steps early in September to commission a force protection assessment review of security arrangements on Manus Island. It listed a long list of things that needed to be conducted and performed, and we have been implementing them over several months. So I look forward to the review.

  I note that the member for Hindmarsh asks about political uncertainty. He asks where political uncertainty is. The political uncertainty has turned its back on the Australian people. The political uncertainty is sitting in that seat, and the political uncertainty caused by the Leader of the Opposition is an industrial go-slow in the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition has called his senators out on an industrial go-slow. Our senators are ready to vote. They are ready to repeal the carbon tax. They are ready to get on with the business of giving Australians lower electricity prices. But, since December, we have had an industrial go-slow in the Senate. This is a throwback to the fifties from a throwback to the fifties! Right now, the Leader of the Opposition, if he wants to be a very modern man, can do something very simple, and that is to send his senators back to work, get them back to the job so that they actually vote on legislation.                 The member for Hindmarsh asks about the costs of the carbon tax. As the Prime Minister said, only a week ago the Clean Energy Regulator confirmed a multibillion dollar hit in the first year - a $4.1 billion hit to electricity bills. I just want to repeat that: $4.1 billion of electricity bills whilst this Leader of the Opposition sits there with his arms crossed and his senators on strike. But, more than that, it is $1.1 billion on manufacturing alone. So at the very moment that the Leader of the Opposition feigns this concern about the jobs of manufacturing workers, he is standing in the way of $1.1 billion in tax relief by removal of the carbon tax for Australia's manufacturing firms and Australia's manufacturing workers. Adelaide Brighton has a gross carbon tax of $62 million, Boral cement has $41 million and Cement Australia has $53 million. And what does the cement industry say? The Cement Industry Federation and the National Lime Association of Australia say that they support the carbon tax repeal legislation and request that the Australian parliament pass the bills well in advance of July 2014.                 Whilst you opposite are sitting on your hands, we have issued a ministerial determination to axe the carbon tax auctions before 30 June. This is your chance, I say to the opposition, to stand up and allow those auctions to be repealed. The determination is in place, the auctions are off and only a disallowance formed by a reunited Greens and Labor alliance can get in the way of them. So we say to you: 'Get out of the way and let us repeal the carbon tax.'

  Let me read to the opposition spokesperson exactly what I said on the Tuesday afternoon:                 _ I am not going to make assumptions until I have further information on that -                  referring to the details of what had occurred to the deceased -                  Where physically -                      No, listen!                     Listen:                 Where physically this took place based on the information I have received this afternoon, that is a matter where there are some conflicting reports.                 A journalist then asked:                 What are the conflicting reports?                 And I said:                 Well the reports are conflicting on where the individual might have been at the time.                 That is the report I gave on the Tuesday afternoon, immediately reporting in the press conference that there were conflicting reports about the nature of that incident and where the individual might have been when those incidents occurred. Over the balance of the week I sought to have those conflicting reports resolved: firstly, by sending the deputy secretary and, secondly, by sending General Campbell. And when General Campbell had returned, and I had received further advice on the Saturday about these incidents, then I produced the information.                     Those opposite ask about what time - in particular, the Manager of Opposition Business. I ask the Manager of Opposition Business: how long did it take him after the Nauru processing centre burnt to the ground to announce -                      Now you get up, don't you! I've got you to your feet now!                     I have been asked about what time, and I am simply making reference to the previous practice of past governments. I note that the Manager of Opposition Business, when he was minister for immigration, took a full week to front the Australian people to announce the review in relation to the Nauru processing centre that burnt down on his watch.                     It was a meltdown on your watch!

  I thank the member for Barton for his question, and I recognise the number of Fijians living in his electorate, as well as the number of Fijians living in Australia.                 I am delighted to be able to inform the House that on the weekend of 14 and 15 February I visited Fiji as part of the ministerial contact group of the Pacific Islands Forum. The six ministers in that contact group welcomed the progress that has been made by the Fijian government towards an election to be held by the end of September this year. In particular, we noted the large number of registrations that have occurred. At the last count it was something like 550,000 voters registered out of a population of about 800,000, including registrations of Fijians living in Australia, the US and elsewhere. We also noted that independent electoral commissioners have been appointed, and we were pleased to see that progress towards these elections is being made. We also held meetings with other Fijian ministers to talk about the election preparations, we met with representatives of the other registered political parties and we met with civil society.                 There are challenges, including the need for freedom of the press. There are challenges involving putting in place an electoral legal framework for the conduct of the elections. We urged the Fijian authorities to have international observers present. There should not be any doubt in the minds of the international community as to the legitimacy of this election when it is held.                 I also took the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Bainimarama. This was his first meeting with an Australian minister since 2008. In accordance with the commitment we took to the Australian people at the last election, we believe it is time for there to be a new and constructive phase in our relationship with Fiji. I outlined to the Prime Minister our plan for deeper engagement. Australia is the largest source of investment for Fiji, we are the largest source of overseas development assistance and we are the largest source of tourists to Fiji, so we believe it is time to rebuild the political ties, including reviewing the travel sanctions.                 In accordance with our election commitment, we have a plan for deeper engagement and that will include public sector exchanges, defence exchanges, and greater trade and investment with Fiji. The Australian business community certainly welcomes the change of foreign policy under this government. Given the deep affection that the Australian people have for the people of Fiji and the affection that the people of Fiji have for Australia, I am proud that this government have been able to change the direction of our foreign policy and work towards embracing Fiji as it leads into an election by the end of September this year.

  The operations manager is an appointee of the chief migration officer of the Papua New Guinean government, Mr Rabura. I first met the operations manager when I visited the centre when I was in opposition. I met him personally when I was visiting that centre in September last year. Officers in my department regularly engage with that operations manager and I maintain that contact through the department, as I do with Mr Rabura.                 The member raises an important question about the jurisdictional issues regarding this centre. This centre is run by the government of Papua New Guinea. The Australian government supports the government of Papua New Guinea in running that centre through the arrangements which were established under the former government and we work within those arrangements.

  I can inform the member for Boothby about the questions that he has put to me. The first question was: how much has the Health Services Union, a registered organisation under the act, provided to a political party from 2007? I can tell the House that the Health Services Union gave $1.2 million to the Australian Labor Party - $1.98 million was donated to the Australian Labor Party from 2007 to last year.                     I can also tell the House that the Fair Work Commission found that $267,721 of Health Services Union members' money was used in the Dobell campaign to elect Craig Thomson, the former member for Dobell. So $1.2 million went from the Health Services Union to the Australian Labor Party and $267,000 of Health Services Union money was found by the Fair Work Commission to have been used to elect the member for Dobell.                 I can also tell the House that the Labor Party paid $350,000 of legal fees for the member for Dobell prior to the last election in order to maintain his vote in the parliament. Senator Sam Dastyari admitted that was paid in order to make sure that he remained in the House and they could, therefore, rely on his vote. Here is an important test for the Leader of the Opposition because he has failed the test on the Registered Organisations Commission, he has failed the test on the Australian Building and Construction Commission and he has failed the test on the royal commission into union corruption. But this is an important test. If it was good enough for the Labor Party to use their members' funds to fund the legal defence of Craig Thomson, the former member for Dobell, will the Labor Party pay back the $267,000 to the Health Services Union members that was taken illegally by the former member for Dobell to use in his campaign to be elected? This is the test for the Leader of the Opposition. If he really stands on the side of workers, he would direct the Labor Party national office to repay $267,000 to some of the poorest workers in the economy, to those members who faithfully handed over their membership dues to the union bosses -                      He has to show whether he is on the side of the worker or on the side of dodgy union officials. Can he rise above his background or will he continue to be a union official and support union officials running a protection racket for a protection racket? This is his latest test, and I hope he will announce today that he will at least pass that test.

  The short answer is that certain requirements were put on the staffer in question. My understanding is that he failed to adhere to those requirements. When it became obvious, the staffer in question resigned and the matter is now at an end.

  It is a pleasure to take a question from the member for Braddon. Last Friday I was in Burnie and Devonport with the member for Braddon. We visited two chambers of commerce. It is indeed an appalling statistic that 20 per cent of young people in the north and north-west of Tasmania are without a job. It was clear to me that the job-destroying carbon tax and the job-destroying Tasmanian Labor government have left these young people without a meaningful pathway from school to work. The cost of doing business in this part of Tasmania is just too high. These jobs should exist - on the farm, in the factory, in forestry, in mining, in agriculture, in aquaculture - and they do not.                 Last week I also held a roundtable with the states and territories to revisit and rewrite the national framework for vocational education in schools. This was created in 2001 by the previous coalition government. The previous Labor government had, I think, five ministers for skills, which shows its lack of commitment to trades training and vocational education. Labor spent a lot of time talking about higher education and tertiary education, but instinctively its approach was this: if you have not made it to university, you have not made it at all. Our approach is very much focused on the young people like those that I met in Tasmania with the member for Braddon and on a first-class pathway from school to work. Our approach will have industry at the table. We want to elevate the status of the trades. We understand the importance for every young person to find that pathway.                 It is interesting that there are a lot of people doing vocational ed in schools but that only nine per cent of the 40 per cent are in a school based apprenticeship. That needs to increase. We need to have school leading to work. Our approach starts -                      with local schools talking to local industry about local skills shortages. We look forward to working with the members for Braddon, Bass and Lyons, to participating in our economic growth plan for Tasmania, and to jobs for young people - real jobs in the real economy.

  For the benefit of the shadow minister opposite, the gentleman in question was required to divest himself of an interest in his wife's business. My understanding is that he was dilatory in doing that. When that became apparent, he resigned. That is as it should be. I would simply make this point: when people on this side of the parliament fail to act by the highest standards of propriety and decency, they go. It is as simple as that. They go, and he is gone.

  I thank the member for Longman for his question. It is not a question those opposite tend to ask me in this place. On that side of the House they have no real interest, it would seem, in how long it has been since a successful people-smuggling venture has made it to Australia. I can inform the House that it is 67 days. That is how many days it is. It is 67 days as of today, 64 as of last Friday, and the reason I say that is because we have not had a consecutive period where there has been no successful venture like this since before the previous government got rid of the policies that worked under the Howard government. The measures that we have put in place are working and they are stopping the boats, and the lead in those matters is what we are doing at sea. I am not going to rely only on our own experience in this. I am going to make reference to Gillian Triggs, who said today: 'I suspect that the real cause of the capacity to save lives has been the stopping of the boats in the physical sense.' And we know what she is referring to - she is referring to our policy of intercepting vessels that seek to illegally enter our waters and removing them. This has been the watershed policy that has been responsible for the success we have seen over the last 67 days.                 Those opposite like to refer to offshore processing, but those opposite had to be dragged kicking and screaming to offshore processing. Now they talk about it as the cornerstone of their policies. It was the only stone they had in their policies and they had to be forced to put it back in place. That measure remains important; it is a backstop measure for any potential vessel that may happen to get through. But for 67 days that has not happened.                 The other measure relates to temporary protection visas for those of the more than 30,000 that the current opposition, when in government, left behind for this government. And those opposite still, to this day, are seeking to frustrate the mandate of this government to remove the possibility of permanent visas for people who have come to this country illegally by boat. They betray themselves, but this government is not going to be intimidated into walking away from our policies. We are not going to be intimidated by the weakness of the Greens or the double-mindedness and hypocrisy of the Labor Party. We are not going to be intimidated by any violence that occurs in any centre anywhere or at sea. Our policies are working. They are stopping the boats and our resolve is absolute.

  I appreciate that members opposite are desperate to find some moral fault with members on this side of the House. I appreciate the embarrassment, in certain important respects, of members opposite when it comes to ethical standards just at this present time. But let me make this point: the minister in question has not breached the standards. She has not breached the standards. She gave what she thought was correct information to the Senate at the time and, as soon as she was aware that the information was incorrect, it was, in fact, corrected for the Senate.  As for the former staffer, he was required to divest himself of a shareholding. He was dilatory in doing so. As soon as that became apparent, he resigned. The matter is at an end. The right thing has been done by all.                 Leave not granted.

  Thank you very much to the hardworking member for Flynn. I appreciate his interest in health and thank him very much for this question. The GP superclinic program was held up by the former Minister for Health, the member for Sydney, former Minister Plibersek. It was one of the great programs of the Labor Party and their time in government. It is worth going back through the GP superclinic program to try to trawl through those many, many successes. Emerald happens to be among those, I am happy to inform the member for Flynn.                     Like the member for Flynn, I am a little old-fashioned on these things. I like to see a doctor's surgery, not an open paddock where patients are expected to go to see a GP. It is old-fashioned, I know -                      but the taxpayers are contributing $5 million for a vacant paddock and not one patient has been seen. Yet the former health minister trumpeted this as one of Labor's great successes. It is all relative, of course.                 It was a $650 million program, the so-called GP superclinic program. Bear in mind that they had to borrow that $650 million. Bear in mind that other health needs faced this nation, such as the ageing of the population and a doubling of the amount that we were spending on medical services over the course of the last 10 years. The Labor Party was still able to set up 12 new bureaucracies and find $650 million of borrowed money to put into these superclinics for none of that to make any difference to patients. This is the ironic part of it: $650 million, in this particular case, was promised in August 2010.                 There is another example I would like to point to and that is the Mt Isa GP superclinic. It was promised on 21 November 2007. In actual fact, I have this glossy press release here which talks about some money - $2Â½ million dollars of borrowed taxpayers' money - being put into a superclinic at Mt Isa. Again, it has never been built. Not one patient has been seen. This Labor Party left this government with $123 billion of accumulated deficits, racing towards debt of $667 billion. And there they were in government - with the former minister, the member for Sydney, saying that this was a great program - wasting money hand over fist, not cutting waiting lists and not investing in the areas that we needed to in health. They wasted money across government. They left us with an incredible mess. But we will clean up Labor's mess in health, as we will do in other portfolios. We will get Australia's health system back on track. But we will not do it by wasting taxpayers' money like Labor did with the superclinic program.

  Again, I understand that the shadow minister in question is attempting to impugn the ethical standards of this government.                     I back the ethical standards of this government absolutely, to the hilt, against the ethical standards that those opposite showed when they were in government. I do. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to show a little bit of repentance for the standards of members opposite, he might say something about the former member for Dobell.                 To get onto the issues that she raised -                      On Health Star Rating, my understanding is that the departmental website was put up before the system was ready to go. That is my understanding. That is the answer that the minister provided to the Senate. Let me make this absolutely crystal clear -                      The minister has done the right thing, and the former staffer did the right thing by resigning. This is a government which takes ethical standards seriously. This is a government that will always act with decency and integrity.                   The member for                    Wakefield                    then left the chamber.                     The staffer in question was dilatory in complying with an undertaking that he had given. He has now done the right thing and he has resigned. The matter is at an end.

  I thank the honourable member and well recall the broadband forum we had in his electorate some months ago. The previous government are notorious for, when embarking on the National Broadband Network project, not undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. What is perhaps not so well known is that they did not bother to even ask the most fundamental question, which is: where is broadband good, where is it okay and where is there no broadband at all? Logically, a government that is going to spend taxpayers' money to address broadband deficiencies would want to target the people who had the worst broadband. Our predecessors in government, the Labor Party, had no idea what the answer to that question was. They did not care, because the only thing that informed their rollout was politics. That is why you saw in marginal seats in Western Sydney the fibre network being rolled out on streets where there were not one but two hybrid fibre-coax networks, where the residents already had a pick of 200-megabit-per-second services.                 What have we done? Last Thursday, we released the complete Broadband availability and quality report and the MyBroadband website, which drills down to 78,000 local areas across Australia and shows what types of broadband are available - wireless, HFC, fibre to the premises, ADSL et cetera - and what the quality of them is. It gives an estimate as to what types of speeds people will get. It shows graphically where broadband is good - and in some places it is very, very good - and it shows where it is really bad. There are 1.6 million premises in Australia where there is either no broadband at all or broadband with medium peak speeds of 4.8 megabits or less per second, which today is unacceptably slow.                 It would have been a lot easier if the previous government had done this from the start and, as I have said to the House many times, we had not been left with, rather than a blank sheet of paper, a real mess to clean up with the NBN. But what we are now going to do is prioritise the worst served areas so that people with poor broadband get it upgraded sooner. The recent strategic review of the NBN estimated that underserved areas can be upgraded on average two years sooner if they are prioritised in the rollout as we are proposing. We are committed to all Australians having access to very fast broadband sooner, cheaper and more affordably, and only the coalition can be counted on to get that job done.

  Thank you. I appreciate the question from the Leader of the Opposition, because obviously Qantas is an iconic Australian business and all of us want to ensure that Qantas flourishes forever. It is a great Australian airline. It is a great Australian icon. We want it to flourish. For that to happen, two things are necessary: first, it needs to be able to compete on a level playing field with its rivals; and, second, it needs to put its own house in order.                  Qantas is doing its best to put its own house in order, and this government will do what it can to ensure that Qantas has a level playing field on which to compete, because that is the best thing that we can do for Qantas. I have to say to members opposite that, if they are fair dinkum about wanting Qantas to flourish, one thing they can do is scrap the carbon tax.                      $106 million a year in just the last year; that is Qantas's carbon tax bill. We want to help Qantas. And we can start helping Qantas by helping the carbon tax.

  I thank the member for Macquarie for her question. I can inform her that this government has a strong, clear and consistent plan for Australia. We are stopping the boats; we are fixing the budget; and we are building the future, a future where every Australian can expect a fair go and every Australian is encouraged to have a go. We have a plan.                  We will build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. A prosperous economy is obviously an economy that creates jobs. And, if you want to create jobs, you have to cut taxes. I will say that again for the benefit of the members opposite: if you want to create jobs, you have to cut taxes. The carbon tax is a tax on jobs; it is a tax on every Australian family's cost of living; and the mining tax is a tax on investment and also a tax on jobs.                  As I have been saying repeatedly for years now, the carbon tax is a $9 billion a year hit on jobs, as well as being a $550 a year hit on every household's cost of living. They are terrible taxes. The carbon tax will reduce the aluminium industry by over 60 per cent; it will reduce the steel industry by 20 per cent. That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do, it seems.                  But I think that members opposite are having second thoughts about the high-taxing agenda of the Leader of the Opposition. We had the member for Fremantle stand up in caucus today and say 'get rid of the mining tax'. Well, she is right. Good on the member for Fremantle. She is speaking up for Western Australia. Is the Leader of the Opposition listening?                     This government will do whatever is needed to stop the carbon tax. We have legislation before the parliament, and just this week the relevant minister introduced a determination to stop the carbon tax auction, to stop the auction of permits. He is a very influential man, because it seems that members opposite agree with him. They are actually dismantling the mechanism to collect the carbon tax. Bill, make up your mind. Go the whole hog; stop the strike in the Senate and scrap this job-destroying tax.

  We want Qantas to be able to compete on a level playing field. We want Qantas to be able to compete in a low-tax, low-cost environment. We want Qantas to be able to manage the business in the best interests of customers, of shareholders and of workers. That is what we want. We want Qantas to survive. We want Qantas to flourish. We want it to maximise employment. That is what we want and the best thing that members opposite can do, if they are fair dinkum about helping Qantas, is scrap the carbon tax. It is a $106 million hit on Qantas. It is a $106 million hit on the jobs of Qantas workers -                    The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     You know what the workers of Qantas and the workers right around Australia want? They do not want a tourist; they want a leader. They do not want someone who just feels their pain; they want someone who works for them. This government is working for the workers of Australia by scrapping the taxes that are hurting their jobs.

  I am delighted to receive this question from the new member for Fisher, who brings a certain decency, diligence and dignity back to the parliament. Long may he reign.                     He asked me: what progress are we making on repealing the carbon tax? We are making progress. We made a very important first step today, when the opposition finally began the crab walk away from the long held belief in the carbon tax. What occurred was this. In the last few days I signed a determination to scrap the carbon tax auctions. These auctions were a critical part of the floating price period of the carbon tax. It does not work without the auctions, and they know it. What we saw was that, instead of standing up for their beloved carbon tax, they did the right thing. They stood back. They allowed the auctions to be revoked.                 The significance of this moment in this parliament should not be underestimated in any way. We see that overnight the ALP has begun the journey to allowing full repeal of the carbon tax. By allowing the auctions to be axed, they know that, through the life of this parliament, you cannot have the floating price period operating in any effective way. What does this mean? It means that they have taken the first step, but we still have to finish the job. At this moment in the Senate the Leader of the Opposition has his senators out on strike. They are on an industrial go-slow in the Senate. We have the bills backed up, and everything they can do to delay repeal of the carbon tax is being done. This is the moment when, if you take the first step, you have to finish the job and repeal the carbon tax.                 Why do we need to do that? It is a multibillion dollar tax - $4.1 billion on electricity alone and $1.1 billion on Australian manufacturing alone. Whether it is a food maker such as Simplot or an airline such as Qantas, who has a $106 million carbon tax, the costs are mounting for each and every Australian. If you want to repeal the carbon tax lock, stock and barrel, the message to the Leader of the Opposition is: listen to what the Australian people voted for, bring your senators back to work - end the industrial go-slow, end the strike, in the Senate - call them in on Monday and get them to vote for repeal of the carbon tax. Get them to honour the election mandate and vote for lower electricity prices.

  I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition is interested in the speech, because it was a good speech, and if he was to study it closely he would learn something. No such measures were proposed in the speech. The Leader of the Opposition should be honest with this parliament. What I did say was that over time, in the longer term, the rate of growth of expenditure has to be restrained. Of course, it has to be restrained. You know why? Because of the fiscal mess that members opposite left. Thanks to members opposite, over the next four years this country is facing prospective deficits totalling $123 billion. It is facing cumulative debt of $667 billion. That is the burden that members opposite have left on future generations of Australians. We will repair the budget, but we will do so in ways which are entirely consistent with our election commitments.

  I thank the member for Petrie. He is right. We were left a mess - $123 billion of deficits, $667 billion of debt and 200,000 more Australians unemployed than when Labor was elected just six years ago. And the budget is in a structural mess as a result of Labor's failure to meet its commitments. They said, they promised - the member for Lilley, the member for McMahon and the whole lot of them promised - that they would get the budget back to surplus. That is what they promised. They said: 'Don't worry. Expenditure will not increase in real terms by more than two per cent.' What have they left us? They have left us with education expenditure rising at three per cent above inflation for the next 10 years; they have left us with health expenditure rising at four per cent per annum above inflation every year for the next 10 years; and they have left us with a pension bill that is increasing by three per cent more than inflation every year for the next 10 years - and they promised it would not be more than two - because they did not have the courage to make the decisions that needed to be made to fix up the budget and make sure that those most vulnerable in the community were cared for. Labor talk about caring for vulnerable people but they do not give a damn, because the net result of all their largesse, the net result of their incompetence, is that the debt per head of population - every man, woman and child - in Australia will double over the next 10 years, to $23,000 per man, woman and child, unless we can address the structural problem left by Labor.                 We take intergenerational responsibility seriously. Of course, they did not just mislead the Australian people about the state of the budget. Oh, no; they went further. They retrospectively misled the Australian people about the budget, because Wayne Swan, in his own newsletter, says: 'We're back in surplus, on time, as promised.' So he is retrospectively fiddling the facts! Well, the truth is: they have left us with a legacy of debt and deficit that is unsustainable. If we want to have jobs, if we want to create new jobs, the only way to do that is through more growth, and the only way to get more growth in place is to get rid of the taxes like the carbon tax and the mining tax, to get the budget back on track, to invest in productive infrastructure, not to waste taxpayers' money and to get on with the job of responsible government.

  I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. I certainly share her concerns about the delays that people in the trucking industry have been experiencing since the beginning of the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator's supervision and issuing of heavy vehicle and wide vehicle permits. It is particularly disappointing because I think members on both sides of the House have been enthusiastically supporting the development of the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. It is an important piece of economic reform that is potentially going to save billions of dollars in the trucking industry over the years ahead. This regulator has been a long time in the making. It was due to start on 1 January 2013. Its start-up time in relation to the issuing of permits was delayed on at least four occasions, and finally there was a view that it was ready to start up. It provides a one-stop shop for the issuing of permits, so, instead of vehicles having to get new permits every time they cross the border, they are able to just get a single permit that deals with all the issues. It is clear that the systems that were in place were inadequate to do the job. In spite of an audit conducted by one of the country's leading auditing companies which said it was ready, the reality was it was not ready. There are deficiencies even in the legislation, which allows 28 days for there to be a permit issued. That is clearly unsatisfactory.                 This morning I met with transport ministers from around Australia to talk about what further response there needs to be to deal with this issue and to try and get the regulator working properly. New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria have taken back the process of issuing licences within their state and negotiating with local government to get the local permits, which have been a significant part of the delays in bringing this to fruition. South Australia is going to take back the management of its permits later this week. From the point of view of ministers, we are not going to allow a return to the national regulator distributing these permits until we are satisfied the systems are fixed and are going to work. We clearly inherited, as a government, an arrangement which was unsatisfactory. A lot of repair work will need to be done, and I would expect that these interim arrangements we have with the states will be in place for several months until everyone has got the confidence that the new system will work well. It is an important reform. We need to get it right. This government is not going to walk away from it, and we will be working with the states to achieve satisfactory permit-issuing systems. But in the interim the states will take back that role so the industry can get its permits issued quickly and on time.

  I thank the member for Cowan for his question. I know that he is concerned about job opportunities in his electorate of Cowan. Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird, and this evening Foreign Minister Baird and I will be addressing the Australia-Canada Economic Leadership Forum, which I know the Prime Minister addressed last evening. We have a strong bilateral relationship with Canada, based on our common values, our shared experiences. But in many ways our economies are competitive. We are both export oriented, open trading economies. Our strengths are in mining and resources and agriculture.                 It is interesting to note that the Harper government, like the Abbott government, has a strong focus on economic growth and job opportunities through a plan to pay off debt, to get their budget back into surplus, to have smaller government and lower taxes and to cut out wasteful spending. And like the Abbott government they are also pursuing a very ambitious free trade agenda for job opportunities for businesses in Canada. One of the most critical steps undertaken by the Canadian government was to reject a carbon tax. As Prime Minister Harper's Parliamentary Secretary Calandra said last year:                 Our government knows that carbon taxes raise the price of everything, including gas, groceries, and electricity.                 Parliamentary Secretary Calandra went on to say that the Canadian government:                 _ has reduced greenhouse gas emissions while protecting and creating Canadians jobs - greenhouse gas emissions are down since 2006, and we've created 1 million net new jobs since the recession - and we have done this without penalising Canadian families with a carbon tax.                 This was the election promise of the Abbott government. When those opposite shed crocodile tears over job losses, they should remember the words of their own climate change adviser, Ross Garnaut. He warned the opposition, when in government, when he said:                 _ regions that are vulnerable to large-scale loss of livelihood as a result of the implementation of a carbon price.                 Their own adviser warned them that there would be large-scale loss of livelihood as a result of the implementation of a carbon price. So not only are emissions set to go up under Labor's carbon tax; they have also been warned about large-scale loss of livelihood. The lesson from our great friends in Canada, the lesson from the Canadian government, is that this opposition should support the repeal of the carbon tax, support the will of the Australian people and support our plan to give business an opportunity to create more jobs.

  I think that the average Australian GP does a very good job, often under difficult circumstances, and we want to support general practice. I have had a bit of experience in this area of health. I have to say that the general practitioners of this country are absolutely the backbone of our system, because, apart from the individual himself or herself, the one person in the whole of the system who invests the time, energy and effort in managing an individual's health is that person's GP. I have nothing but admiration and respect for the GPs of Australia and we will do what we can to make their job easier, not harder.                 The only people who really made life hard for the GPs of Australia in recent times, funnily enough, were members opposite. Let us not forget that the former minister for health, sitting over there as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, looking a little bit embarrassed, is the person who let the MYEFO at the end of 2012 cut $1.6 billion out of health. Shame, shame, shame!

  I thank the member for Calare for his very important question. The reality is that the carbon tax is adding to the cost of fuel right across the country and it is adding therefore to the cost of doing business wherever we are. There is carbon tax on the diesel used by trains to move products to the port. There is carbon tax on the trains that carry people to work. If you travel to work on a train, whether it be diesel or electric, you pay a carbon tax. If you drive your car to work there is no carbon tax directly applied to the fuel. If the Greens really believe in public transport, as they say, if members opposite really believe in the importance of encouraging use of public transport, they will vote against the carbon tax. Get rid of the carbon tax. It will make public transport cheaper and therefore a more competitive way for people to travel to work. If you are worried about wanting to build more infrastructure or you want to build more roads, there is carbon tax applying to the diesel used in graders and trucks building roads across the country. If you want better investment in infrastructure and better value for money, vote against the carbon tax.                 Yesterday I referred to the carbon tax on aviation fuel. If you want a more competitive airline, if you want our Australian airlines to be more competitive than airlines in other parts of the world, vote out the carbon tax. Get rid of the carbon tax. The reality is that the carbon tax is adding to the cost of everything we do. I know the member for Calare is well and truly aware of the fact that, if Labor had its way, the carbon tax would be added to all transport fuel from 1 July this year. Their intention was to extend the carbon tax - 6Â½ cents a litre, 7Â½ cents a litre  - to every truck operating in this nation. That was Labor's plan. If they had been re-elected we would be getting a carbon tax on the entire transport industry. We do not want it on the transport industry. We do not want it at all. The people have voted to get rid of it and it is time this parliament responds to the demands of the Australian people and abolished the carbon tax.

  It is good to get a question from the member for Perth. I apologise because I actually misled the House earlier, inadvertently, when I referred to the member for Fremantle wanting to get rid of the mining tax. I suspect she does want to get rid of the mining tax, but only the member for Perth was brave enough today to say to the caucus, 'The mining tax is an anti-Western Australian tax and it should be repealed.' She is right. I am pleased that the member for Perth is against harmful taxes. So am I, and there is no such tax planned.

  For the benefit of the member for Lyons, the carbon tax is an absolutely cruel tax on small business. This is something that was reinforced when I recently visited New Norfolk with the member for Lyons for a small business forum. Time and time again, they talked about the impediments to small business, that great driver of growth, economic activity and employment. They said, 'Why is it that a government that has been voted out wants to hang on to a carbon tax that actually impedes our ability to create opportunities in our community?' In Tasmania, small business and family enterprises are the economy. They are so crucial to livelihoods for those citizens. What stands in their way? It is excess red tape, excessive taxes, particularly the carbon tax, and a disinterested Labor Party that has not heard the election result and wants to hang on to a tax that is a job destroyer. You can imagine the conversations we had when the member for Lyons outlined how a local IGA was paying some four times the amount for refrigerant gases on top of all the other carbon tax related price increases for energy - natural gas and electricity - in the whole supply chain and how hard it is for that small business to compete.                 If the opposition leader is interested in jobs, I will help him with a plan for jobs. Under the former Labor government 412,000 jobs were lost in small business. Why? Their policy settings were hostile to small business. Small businesses understands that. The electorate understands that. The citizens in the member for Lyons electorate understand that. I just met with the Ai Group and they understand it. This government understand it. Why are those opposite standing in the road of giving small business the chance to recover its contribution to the economy and its opportunity to provide jobs and livelihoods? We are getting on with the work of getting rid of this job-destroying carbon tax.                  The ACCC has been given a direction to start monitoring electricity and natural and synthetic gas prices so we have a baseline for costs that have resulted from the carbon tax. Why is that important? When we get to actually axe the tax, which is what the electorate wants and what small business are crying out for, we can make sure that those price increases that were a result of Labor's carbon tax are taken out of business and taken out of households, that the spending power of households in Lyons and right across the continent is restored, and that cost pressures are taken out of small business. We have a plan for jobs. It is about putting the business back into small business. One great impediment is the carbon tax. If you are slightly interested in jobs, Leader of the Opposition, why don't you join us to axe this tax and let small business get back to that powerhouse of employment they were before Labor cruelled the sector over six years?

  I thank the member for McPherson for her question. It is very important that this House express its regret and apologise for the statement the former member for Dobell made in 2012. Why is it so? It is so because the privilege that attaches to members of parliament to be free to be able to raise matters in this place without the fear of defamation proceedings is a privilege that should only ever be used in defence of our constituents and because we are trying to do good in this place. It should never be a weapon to be wielded to attack opponents who cannot fight back, which is what the former member for Dobell did in 2012.                 The former member for Dobell used parliamentary privilege to defame individual members of this House and also individuals outside the parliament and to mislead the parliament with a fantastic story that he then did not repeat in court when he had the opportunity to stand by it. In fact, not only did he not repeat it but he did not dispute the facts in the case as put by the prosecution. He simply said that the facts were as agreed by the prosecution and defence but that he had the authority to use Health Services Union members' funds for the purposes that he has been found guilty of.                 This presents the Leader of the Opposition with an opportunity. This afternoon's debate presents him with an opportunity because he said to Neil Mitchell in 2011 in answer to the question:                 You've run a union, you understand these things, do you support him?                 Oh, yeah, I believe him -                  the Leader of the Opposition said.                 You got complete confidence in him?                 Neil Mitchell asked him and he said yes. He made it absolutely clear in 2011 that he utterly supported and had full confidence in the former member for Dobell. I expect this afternoon that the member for Maribyrnong, the Leader of the Opposition, will be on his feet not only to apologise for the mistakes he made in supporting the former member for Dobell but also to apologise for providing $350,000 of ALP members' money to the former member for Dobell to defend his actions in the courts.                 I assume that the Leader of the Opposition will announce today that he is going to pay back the $267,000 that the former member for Dobell stole from Health Services Union members, some of the poorest-paid workers in Australia, from the $1.2 million that those union members provided to the Labor Party over six years. It is the very least that the Leader of the Opposition can do.

  I thank the member for Herbert and am pleased to be asked this question about the report that was released on Saturday evening. I notice that I have had no questions from those opposite about the Nauru riots that occurred on their watch. I have not heard any calls for the report to be released any earlier. They seem to want to whitewash the history of the time they were in government. Their border protection record was 50,000-plus arrivals, more than 800 vessels and the tragedy of more than 1,100 deaths.                 On one particular night, 19 July, there was a riot on Nauru. When you read the findings in the independent report, which was commissioned by the previous minister a week or so after the event, you find the report outlines what happens when a government is dragged kicking and screaming to implement a policy it does not believe in. That was the record of the previous government when it came to offshore processing. Year after year after year in opposition the coalition said, 'You need to restore offshore processing,' and year after year after year the then government denied it. They said: 'You shouldn't do it; it won't have an outcome; it won't help.' They also said you could not turn back boats and temporary protection visas should not be implemented. They still believe the latter two despite the success of our operations, particularly those at sea. They said that could never work, but clearly it is working because it is now 68 days since there has been a successful people-smuggling venture to this country.                 The report says $60 million in damage to taxpayer-funded services and facilities occurred on that evening. It finds that the planning of those centres was poorly conceived by the previous government to the point of failing a duty of care. It says there was hands-off oversight and that the intelligence response failed up the chain, so when intelligence existed there was no ability to respond to it up the chain. It says there was a lack of clarity relating to the powers of police and security officers on that evening. It says there was no pre-emptive exercise of authority undertaken to prevent those sorts of incidents from emerging. It says staffing levels were inadequate to deal with large-scale non-compliant behaviour.                 We are now dealing with the results of another very serious incident, and many of the design flaws present on Nauru were present in putting together the facility on Manus Island. When you are dragged kicking and screaming to implement a policy, as the previous government was, then accidents will happen.

  I thank the member for his question. I outlined yesterday to this House when I had the personal meeting with the operations manager appointed by the Chief Migration Officer from Papua New Guinea -                      That was in September, that is right - that is when it was. And on a daily basis my department and agencies work with that operations manager. I know those opposite like to meddle in the operational affairs of their agencies and give them all sorts of directions, but is the opposition seriously suggesting that on a day-to-day basis ministers should direct the operations of those centres?                 I have a highly competent secretary, the same secretary that serviced the three ministers previously on that side of the House, and that secretary together with my department works together with the service providers at that centre. One of the things that we did do when we came to government was this: on that visit that I made in September of last year with General Molan it became absolutely crystal clear that the situation was not right on Manus Island - that the security situation on Manus Island was deficient - and, as a result, the first thing I did was to instruct Lieutenant General Campbell to do a force protection assessment review on Manus Island. Over the last five months we have been filling the $1.2-billion black hole of inadequate funding and support for an under-resourced, understaffed, undercapitalised centre that was put in place by the previous government - the previous government that appointed all the service providers and all of the arrangements for those service providers who were on watch that night.                 The review into the Manus Island incident will take its course. It will look at all of these matters. It will review all of these matters. It will review the decisions taken by the previous government as well as the decisions taken by this government. In February that included sending 130 additional security officers to Manus Island to deal with the brewing incident. I know this: as terrible as the events of that night last week were, without the actions taken by this government over the last five months to clean up the mess on Manus Island that was left by the previous government - for a policy they were dragged kicking and screaming to implement - if it were not for those actions, the situation would have been far worse.

  I thank the member for his question. The issue of youth unemployment is a very important issue and I was stunned by the comments of the Labor Premier of South Australia in today's Australian.                     I was stunned by the Labor Premier in today's Australian. Unemployed young people in northern Adelaide -                      should be disturbed and disgusted that their Labor Premier -                      That their Labor Premier would describe their plight as -                      We believe every young Australian should have the opportunity to have a job. This government believes that youth unemployment needs to be addressed. The Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Steven Marshall, clearly takes this issue seriously and it is about time the Labor Premier of South Australia did the same. Federal Labor created this problem. Youth unemployment increased by almost three per cent when they were in office - 55,000 more young people are unemployed as a result of their failed policies. By contrast, this government has a comprehensive plan to address the issue of youth unemployment.                     We will introduce legislation to give effect to our Job Commitment Bonus, which encourages young people to get and keep a job. We will introduce a new relocation assistance program which will help young people move to where the jobs are. But the most important thing that a government can do to help young people is to develop a strong economy, and we have the plan to do that. It is just unfortunate that the Leader of the Opposition in this place sees fit to stand in the way of creating opportunities for young people through the repeal of the carbon tax, standing in the way of the repeal of the mining tax and the opportunities that that would create for young people, and standing in the way of implementation of the ABCC that has the potential to create so many jobs in the construction industry for which young people could be eligible. One thing that the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of South Australia have in common is that they care little for the jobs of young people. It is about time that the Leader of the Opposition got out of the way.

  This is a very, very important question. The previous government presided over an enormous amount of waste in the Health portfolio - the former minister looks away, looking for some help from fuelwatch and GroceryWatch man beside her. She presided over the $650 million. You won't get any tips from him, I can tell you that much! You'll get no tips or good advice from that man. He was not only the Treasurer but the failed immigration minister. He was a disgrace.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. I was asked about different approaches to the way in which we can eliminate some of the waste from not just the Health portfolio but within the health sector as well. I want to recognise the efforts of the current member for Dobell because she has a very different approach to the health workers within her electorate - a very, very different approach, I might say. There are about 4,000 health workers in the electorate of Dobell. Those workers toil away in public hospitals on minimum wages, in difficult circumstances, and they are the backbone of the health system in this country. The current member for Dobell of course wants to represent them, to work hard for them. She wants to make a better situation in our health system across the country. She is a great champion of health workers, not just in her electorate but across the country.                 Of course, the contrasting approach is very, very interesting. I notice the Leader of the Opposition has picked up a pen and he is writing furiously. 'Union Bill' needs to listen to this response because this is very important. It is about workers you pretend to represent, Mr Shorten.                     Certainly, and thank you very much for the compliment from the member opposite. Thank you very much, Member for Watson.                 The problem is that the former member for Dobell, who was sanctioned by the Leader of the Opposition, who was protected by each and every union official sitting opposite, and there are many union bosses sitting opposite who pretend to put the workers as their priority - the former member for Dobell's great approach to health workers was to take the money out of the pocket of health workers but to put it into the pocket of other workers, just not health workers. I can tell you that not only did it extend to those 4,000 workers, but the HSU was ripped off by not only the member for Dobell but other union officials, of course. All of that was known to members opposite but they did nothing about it. And in actual fact they paid $350,000 of legal expenses for the previous member, to protect the former member for Dobell. There is a very different approach that Labor takes to workers. We will protect the workers. They pretend to.

  It is true that if people engage in riotous behaviour inside the fence or outside the fence then there will need to be actions taken by the appropriate authorities whether they are outside the fence or inside the fence to restore order, but at all times those persons in restoring order must act lawfully. And it is important that, when you select service providers to provide security in places like this, you select service providers that have the appropriate briefs and arrangements in place to ensure that they act appropriately in those situations. Where they breach those conditions, if they were to breach those conditions, then obviously they would be matters that would be subject to review and subject to appropriate sanctions, should that have taken place.                 In my earlier answer to an earlier question I talked about some of the things that we decided to change after we came to office, as we know it was the previous government who set the facility up, it was the previous government who selected the contractors. One of the things we changed last December is we chose not to renew the contract of the security provider at the completion of their term.

  I thank the member for both her question and her continuing, enthusiastic and knowledgeable contribution to our broadband policy. In December the strategic review told us the melancholy truth about the current state of the project we inherited from Labor and what our realistic options were to fix it. The rollout statistics since December are now accurate and meaningful, and published not when it suits the minister's convenience but every single week. Last Thursday, for the first time, the Department of Communications published a detailed analysis of broadband availability and quality across Australia. On Friday the NBN management held a results briefing on its last six months. The chairman, CFO and chief operating officer gave a detailed presentation and then took questions from the media and industry analysts, all streamed live over the web, and this will be repeated every three months.                 I note that today in TheAustralian David Frith has said that since the election the project has come to a standstill. In fact, since the election active fibre premises have nearly doubled to 95,000, total fibre premises passed have increased by 120,000, and serviceable brownfield premises are up by 74,000. The truth is: the fibre build is proceeding faster than ever.                 But probably the most extreme reaction to the NBN Co's new transparency and honesty - openness about both past mistakes and current operations, and realism about future plans - has come from Senator Conroy. His rage against the truth is now so intemperate that today the Senate estimates committee had to be temporarily adjourned by the chairman after his abuse of witnesses reached new lows as he waged his solitary war of denial, continuing to claim that the project was in perfect shape when he left office. This is all the more puzzling because Senator Conroy is the shadow defence minister. But there is a connection - tenuous, I grant you - between Senator Conroy's denialism and the military, because he has become the Lieutenant Onoda of the Australian parliament - the Japanese officer who, refusing to accept that the war had ended, fought on in the jungles of the Philippines for 28 years after the end of hostilities. When Lieutenant Onoda finally surrendered, he still had his sword, his rifle and 500 rounds of ammunition. Will it be 28 years before Senator Conroy too, clutching his dog-eared bundle of reckless forecasts, finally surrenders to the truth: that he presided over the most wasteful infrastructure debacle in our history?

  I do thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because he is effectively inviting me to state my full confidence in the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, and I am very happy to state my full confidence in the minister. What we need in this particular job is a minister who is strong and decent. We know that this minister is strong because we have now gone almost 70 days without an illegal people smuggling -                      Thank you -                      So we have got a Minister for Immigration and Border Protection who has, through his policy, through his strength, ensured that, for almost 70 days, there has been no illegal people-smuggling venture arrive in this country. I think in the last 3Â½ years there have been five ministers for immigration. Four have failed; one has succeeded: the current Minister for Immigration and Border Protection.                 We all deeply regret the events in and around the Manus camp last week. We deeply regret that. What we are determined to do and what the minister is now doing is ensuring that we have the full facts - that the matter is fully investigated so that everything that is necessary to ensure that this camp is properly run can be done.                 The interesting thing is: despite a very, very serious riot - a serious riot involving, we think, some hundreds of people - by the next morning the camp was operating; people were being fed, clothed and housed. That is as it should be.                 We deeply regret - of course we do - the fact that Mr Reza Berati lost his life. We will do everything we can to ensure that never again does anyone lose his or her life because of illegal people smuggling. That is why it is so important to stop the boats and, thanks to this minister, the boats are stopping.

  Let me thank the member for Durack for her question and her ongoing interest in maritime surveillance. Considering she has the largest electorate in the country - the second largest in the world - and over 6,000 kilometres of coastline making up her area, including huge oil and gas assets, the question is most appropriate. As the House would recall, a few days ago the Prime Minister announced that the government will acquire eight P-8 Poseidon aircraft and consider four additional such aircraft, pending the defence white paper process. This is the manned component of the AIR 7000 program that began under the Howard government, continued through numerous governments and will continue with numerous more governments. It will provide essential maritime surveillance capability. Be under no doubt: it is a potent and highly versatile aircraft. As well as patrolling Australia's maritime approaches, it will conduct search and rescue missions, and antisubmarine and maritime strike missions by using torpedoes and indeed harpoon missiles.                 Together with our high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles, these will replace the current Air Force P3C Orions that have served us so well for over four decades. It is appropriate at this juncture that the House actually thank those who have flown and do fly these aircraft over these 40 years. They have been the most heavily deployed assets from the Air Force that the ADF has used over so many decades for not only Operation Relex in the past through Border Protection Command and Operation Resolute but numerous operations to the Middle East and the Middle East area of operations.                  These state-of-the-art aircraft will massively boost our ability to patrol the maritime approaches, something like 2.5 million square kilometres of our maritime jurisdiction, an area which is four per cent of the entire earth's oceans. The first aircraft will arrive in about 2017, with all eight operational by 2021. The project will offer significant opportunity for industry and local job creation. Australian businesses have already won well over $8 million of work associated with our participation in this P-8 program and stand by to enjoy in the order of $1 billion more through construction of facilities at RAAF Base Edinburgh as well as other work in maintenance and through-life support right across the country.                 We are absolutely committed to ensuring Australian industry benefits, including small business, to the highest degree possible. We are committed to ensuring Australian industry has every opportunity to be involved in this project not only in South Australia, where they will be housed, but right around the country. I would encourage all of Australia's small businesses to get informed and get involved.

  I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I think all members of the house for the concern that they have shown about our fellow Australians, particularly in Western Queensland and western New South Wales, who are suffering from crippling drought. I was pleased to be with the Minister for Agriculture about 10 days ago in the member for Maranoa's electorate. I was also in the member for Parkes's electorate and the member for Farrer's electorate to look at the predicament and to hear first hand what people are experiencing.                 I should point out to the House that a once-in-20-year drought - let alone a once-in-a-century drought, which is what some people are experiencing -  is much more akin to a natural disaster than it is to an ordinary variation in the business cycle. I want to assure country Australians, I want to assure all Australians, that this government intends to stand by people in need. We intend to stand by people in good times and in bad.                 The package of measures which the minister and myself announced earlier today is, I believe, fair, fiscally responsible and builds on existing programs. That is why it is able to be implemented reasonably quickly. There are five elements to the package which the minister and I announced. The first is greater access to income support for drought affected people who have no income and who cannot sell, cannot leave and cannot borrow on the strength of their properties; greater access to concessional loans for drought-hit farmers; more assistance to state governments dealing with feral animals; more assistance to state governments to deal with water infrastructure projects; and more assistance to community groups who are dealing with people in personal crisis.                 I think the Australian people get it when it comes to drought. They understand that our cities cannot live without a countryside to support them. That is why I am sure that Australians will welcome the package of measures that the minister and I announced today. Obviously, what we really need is rain. I hope and pray for rain. The government, regrettably, cannot work miracles, but we will do what we reasonably can to stand with people in trouble. My message to country people is: we will not let you down.

  The short answer is: neither. I know that there is likely to be a series of questions today from members opposite on this subject, but I can assure members opposite that on this particular issue there is Labor smoke but there is no coalition fire - there is smoke without fire. I wish to make two essential points. The first is that every action that this good minister has taken is eminently defensible, and within a couple of days of issues being raised the staff member in question did the right thing and he resigned.

  I thank the member for Parkes, who allowed me into his electorate with the Prime Minister. It has been part of the hard work he has done over such a long period of time - and not only him, but also the member for Farrer, Susan Ley, and the member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott. I also commend the Leader of the Opposition and thank him for his support. I think issues such as this should rise above politics. It is a clear example of the Australian people who are seeing mums and dads doing it tough and are under the pump and who are saying, 'That for this issue we'll put politics aside, because we must concentrate on these people, who are such a clear reflection on who we are.'                  I would also like to thank the people of the Australian cities - in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane - who when they are vox-popped say that they get it; they understand quite clearly that these are people who need to be supported because they live by the vagaries of the weather. They live by the fact that for the last 18 months or two years they have had no income stream and they have no prospect of one for the next six to eight months, in many instances. Nobody else would want to see themselves in that position, where someone would say to you, 'Well, not only have we not paid you in the last 18 months, but we don't intend to pay you for at least another half a year.' You could not survive.                 The question clearly pointed out some of the advantages of this and how we move things forward. I want to point out a few of them. We will be moving the assets test on what was formerly known as the Transitional Farm Family Payment to the new settings so that it goes from 1.5 to 2.55, exempting the farmhouse and also allowing off-farm assets that are comparable to what you would get under other social security packages. We will also make sure that we give the capacity to the person to earn money off farm up to the value of $80,000, providing that their interest bill is in excess of that. What you will often note, and the member for Parkes will be aware of this, is that the money from that just goes straight to the bank. We will also be making sure that people have access to a concessional rate of four per cent for a million dollars or 50 per cent of their loan, whichever is the lesser, so that we keep control of that credit and we are prudent with the finances of our nation. The advantage if someone has money at, say, eight per cent and they can refinance down to four per cent - $40,000 per million over five years that is $200,000 and that is a real advantage.                 We will also be looking at mental health and we know how important those issues are. We will be re-investing in them. There are other issues such as wild dogs - people might snigger about it - but it is important. There is no point in feeding the sheep if the sheep are getting eaten by wild dogs and other animals. Water infrastructure is also vitally important. I commend the work that has been done by so many and I thank the Prime Minister for his support.

  I would like to thank Professor Palmer for the question. I would to make a confession to him and to Australia: I am not very familiar with the budget position of Equatorial Guinea or Uzbekistan. I am more familiar with the United States. The fact is that the United States economy has been running at a substantial deficit for a number of years. The quantitative easing in the United States has suited their times but, of course, tapering is now coming into play. As tapering comes into play and the previous fiscal drag that was in place in the United States is no longer in place, in this current year, the United States economy continues to grow - although I must say there was recognition at the G20 over the weekend that there had been some disappointing data that had come out of the United States over the last month or so, which many are carefully monitoring. The fact is that we need a strong United States to have a strong global economy. We want the world economy to continue to improve. It is the case also that easy monetary policy, whether it be in Australia or around the rest of the world, is not going to do the long-term heavy lifting when it comes to growing the economy. That has to come through structural change in economies.                 Australia is no different. Easy monetary policy will, at some time in the future, come to an end. The result is that unless we have prepared our economies by having appropriate structural reform such as: getting rid of the carbon tax; getting rid of the mining tax; having a better balance in workplace relations by bringing back the Australian Building and Construction Commission; ensuring that the budget gets back to a sustainable surplus and that as a nation we live within our means - and if we do not do it and other countries do not do it - then the problems that have beset the world over the last few years will come back again and we will consign a future generation around the world to a lesser quality of life than that which we have had. There is no easy solution here. There are only hard solutions and the whole nation and the whole world need to do the heavy lifting.

  I thank the member for Barker for his question and recognise, as he does, that the mining tax was one of the worst public policy disasters of the last six years.                     It is a big call. It is a very significant call. There has been a helluva lot of competition for bad policy over the last six years but the mining tax was right up there. It was originally forecast to raise $49.5 billion over 10 years, and after 18 months it raised $400 million. The problem was that Labor committed all this new expenditure against a tax that did not raise any money. To put it in perspective, it was like having a $75,000 yearly salary, spending all that money and more, but only getting $6,000 in salary in that year.                 So where does that leave the budget? The Labor Party is so supportive of the mining tax that they are happy to see the budget $13 billion worse off. That means $13 billion of extra debt. The mining tax, as a matter of principle, is harmful for the economy because, as was clearly pointed out during its bungled introduction, it was going to have a negative impact on investor sentiment and it was going to affect the reputation of Australia as a safe and stable place to do business.                 I am glad that the new member for Perth understands this. I am glad that the new member for Perth, previously a minister for planning and infrastructure in Western Australia, knows that the mining tax is bad for Australia. But I would suggest to the member for Perth that she just lean over to the person on her right and whisper into old Swanny's ear, 'What were you thinking, mate?' Go on, give it a shot - just whisper. You do not have to move your lips. Or write him a little handwritten note: 'What were you thinking of, Swanny, introducing a mining tax that raises no money, spending all that money against that tax, leaving Western Australia worse off and representing a threat to the sustainability of good finances?'                  But the problem is that this is typical Labor. In South Australia we have just seen that Jay Weatherill, the Premier of South Australia, has had a story leaked that identifies a $212 million hole in the budget. That is almost Swanny-esque. Jay Weatherill, where did that go to - another $212 million missing in a Labor budget. That is the problem. Labor do not understand money and they certainly do not understand taxes.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question and I acknowledge his distinguished service as an officer in the Australian Army and his deployment in Afghanistan and Iraq. There is an unwritten rule, indeed, a protocol that has been observed for decades in this parliament and across Australian political life, that there be bipartisan support for our military, our troops, whether at home or abroad.                     That was shattered yesterday in Senate estimates by Senator Stephen Conroy when he launched an attack, when he traduced the reputation of one of Australia's most distinguished military commanders for serving his country.                      Senator Conroy attacked this commander's motives and his conduct in a most despicable slur designed to dishonour an honourable man.                 Lieutenant General Angus Campbell has served this country for 30 years: as a squadron commander of the SAS and he commanded the 2nd Battalion group in the UN Mission in East Timor. Indeed, he was awarded the Order of Australia for exceptional service. He commanded all Australian troops in the Middle East and he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his outstanding leadership.                 He is a man of the highest calibre; an officer who has served his country with distinction. It was because of his outstanding skills that he was asked by the Australian government to serve his country once more. He has headed up Operation Sovereign Borders to fix the mess that was left on our borders by the last Labor government.                 Operation Sovereign Borders was endorsed by the Australian people at the last election. It has been designed to dismantle the criminal people-smuggling trade. It is designed to stop people taking that dangerous journey to Australia and it is designed to save lives. It is dangerous work and it is difficult work, and General Campbell has undertaken this task with the professionalism and diligence for which he is renowned.                 Labor can disagree with that policy. They can come up with their own policy. They can attack the government. But they should never engage in the gross disrespect that we saw meted out to General Campbell in Senate estimates yesterday. General Campbell himself said he took extreme offence at the slurs.                     Now, Senator Conroy should apologise. The member for Hunter knows that. Senator Conroy should apologise - he should have given an unqualified apology. If he does not, the Leader of the Opposition should remove him from the role of shadow minister for Defence. He is unfit for that role.

  I thank the member opposite for her question. The premise of the question is simply wrong. It is simply wrong. People are entitled to disagree with the position of the government, but the position of the government was determined by the government and by the minister. It is eminently defensible.                 Leave not granted.

  Let me thank the member for Mitchell for his question, and acknowledge that as he is a former Army Reserve officer he is a man with deep interest in the military.                 It is now a matter of national attention that Senator Conroy has opened his account as Labor's Defence spokesman with a grubby and premeditated slur against one of our most respected three-star Lieutenant General officers, accusing him of a political cover-up no less. Six months of near total silence from the opposition's shadow Defence minister and he decides the best way to come out and support those who support us is to sling mud at a general's face.                 Let me tell you what the military says. It says, 'The standard you walk past is the standard you accept'. And what the nation wants to know and what this parliament wants to know, Leader of the Opposition, is whether you accept the comments - whether you -                      Madam Speaker, what the nation wants to know is whether the Leader of the Opposition accepts the comments made by the shadow Defence spokesman. And if not, what is the Leader of the Opposition going to do about it?                     The Leader of the Opposition was asked today, 'Do you personally think Conroy went too far?' And the Leader of the Opposition's response? 'The senator has withdrawn his remarks, and that speaks for itself.' Well, the only thing that speaks for itself is that the Leader of the Opposition's abject failure to bring into line his own shadow defence minister is as unacceptable as the original comments themselves. Will the Leader of the Opposition look at what former Labor defence minister, the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, said when asked today about his regard for Stephen Conroy? His response was, 'Stephen Conroy is doing an excellent job as the shadow defence minister.'                 As is clear from the above examples, it is not in order for Ministers to be questioned on opposition policies, for which they are not responsible. The Speaker has been critical of the use of phrases at the end of questions, such as 'are there any threats to ...', that could be viewed as intended to allow Ministers to canvass opposition plans -                      If that was not enough, Senator Conroy was given another chance to apologise. He could not manage it. He could not man up and manage it. He even went so far as to say that the people who should apologise apparently are the Australian government.                 Our serving men and women deserve a lot better than this sort of grubby attack. They deserve an opposition leader who mans up, an opposition leader who says, 'I don't condone this behaviour.' If the opposition leader had some courage, he would demand that Senator Conroy publicly apologise for these outrageous remarks. If the Leader of the Opposition takes no action, he reduces himself to exactly the same level as Senator Conroy. And, let us face it, if Senator Conroy were in the Army, he would be peeling potatoes right now.

  I do appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition is a little embarrassed by the conduct of Senator Conroy.                     If the Leader of the Opposition is embarrassed by Senator Conroy's conduct, he should have a word in Senator Conroy's ear and say that it would be good for his dignity and that of the parliament if he simply apologised to General Campbell.                     Obviously anticipating this issue, members opposite have decided that this is some kind of a riposte for the Leader of the Opposition's unwillingness to pull into line his shadow minister for defence. The trouble with this question is that it is false - utterly, absolutely and completely false. It is typical, I regret to say, of this opposition. They never let the facts get in the way of a good smear. That is typical of this opposition.                     The truth is that the conditions of service of personnel in the Middle East have changed. Haven't members opposite realised that we are no longer in combat in Afghanistan? Haven't they recognised that we have concluded our combat mission in Afghanistan? Haven't they realised that? Well, we have. We have concluded our combat mission in Afghanistan.                   The member for Kingston then left the chamber.                     Has the Leader of the Opposition forgotten that he and I both went to Tarin Kot to solemnly observe that our combat mission had ended? Because the conditions of service have changed, the relevant allowances have changed. That decision was made quite properly by the service chiefs in response to the changed conditions of service in Afghanistan. I can see the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon, sitting there squirming in embarrassment at this grubby tactic on the part of the opposition. You should be embarrassed by Senator Conroy's behaviour -                      I am sorry, what was that?                     The best way to deal with this issue is for the Leader of the Opposition to ask Senator Conroy to apologise.

  I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and her keen interest in these issues; I know it has always been a very keen interest of the electors of Lindsay. It has been 69 days since there has been a successful people-smuggling venture make it to Australia. But despite the success to date of this operation, it still faces obstacles. And those obstacles sit on that side of the chamber, they sit amongst the Greens and they sit in the other place as they band together. Those obstacles are there.                 So miffed are those opposite about the success of this government's border protection policies, and how that has exposed their weakness and their incompetence and their failure in government - as boat after boat arrived, as person after person arrived, as boat after boat sunk - that what they seek to do is adopt the policy of miff. They will try and make it fail. That is what they are trying to do. What they are trying to do is make the government's policies fail. Make it fail.                  The Leader of the Opposition has become the chief executive of 'wreck the joint', and not just wreck the joint when it comes to the government's border protection policies but also wreck the joint when it comes to the budget. As a former union official he knows exactly how to do it, he knows exactly how to wreck the joint. He is the chief executive of 'wreck the joint' when it comes to policy in this country.                     'Make it fail' is the objective of that opposition when it comes to this government's policies.                     But unsatisfied with seeking to frustrate us, frustrate our policies, to deny the obvious that our maritime operations are having success and seeking to undermine them, now they have embarked on a new strategy - that is, to attack the people who are implementing our policies. He may be a resident of 'Conrovia' on some other distant planet, as the Minister for Communications advises us from time to time, but it is up to this Leader of the Opposition to call into line the most disgraceful act of Senator Conroy against Lieutenant General Campbell in the Senate last night. He accused him of a political cover up, and this Leader of the Opposition's failure to force an apology from that senator to Lieutenant General Campbell is an absolute disgrace.                 I will say there is one member opposite who knew what was the right thing to do last night, and that is the member for Chifley. This is what he said last night: 'I'm not going to dance around it. What he said was wrong' - referring to Senator Conroy - 'it shouldn't have been said, not to a serving officer, in that way.' Well maybe the member for Chifley should be able to step up, because this Leader of the Opposition cannot step up when it comes to these matters of border protection.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for her question. I do welcome the bipartisan support that the government received yesterday for its motion to apologise for the statement of the former member for Dobell, Mr Craig Thomson, on 21 May 2012. Admittedly it was two years too late, but better late than never.                     The Leader of the Opposition at least measured up to that test and led the Labor Party into stopping the protection racket -                      that had existed around the former member for Dobell. But it presents the Leader of the Opposition with other tests that he needs to meet if he is going to prove that he is more than a union official representing union officials, that he runs a protection racket for protection rackets. Those tests are mounting up, like passing the Australian building and construction commission bill, passing the registered organisations commission bill, supporting the Royal commission into union governance and union corruption. He needs to pay back the $267,000 of HSU members' money that Labor used to elect the former member for Dobell in 2007.                 And there is a new test that has been set for him today if he is going to show that he is a real leader and not just a union official representing union officials - that is, whether he will stand up to Senator Conroy in the Senate and make him apologise for the egregious remarks that he made yesterday to Lieutenant General Campbell. He attacked him and used him as a political football. The Leader of the Opposition said himself, on 23 January this year, 'I don't like seeing the Navy -                      The reason it is relevant to the question is because Senator Conroy is a well-known union organiser from way back. He cut his teeth as a union organiser, and the question is about union power and the misuse of it.                     And the reason why Senator Conroy remains in the position he is in today -                      Madam Speaker, it is directly relevant to the question, because the reason Senator Conroy remains in the position he is today; the reason he was brought back from political death; the reason why the Leader of the Opposition won't make him apologise today is because he relies on him to stay in the position of Leader of the Opposition: Senator Conroy has the power. He is calling the tune - just like every other union leader that the Leader of the Opposition responds to, about all those policies. Whether it is the Australian Building and Construction Commission, the Registered Organisations Commission, the royal commission - the Leader of the Opposition is a union official representing union officials. He went to the AWU conference two years ago, and he said, 'I am union today; union tomorrow; union forever.' The point is, he needs to rise above his background. He could start by disciplining Senator Conroy, and apologising for the way he treated our military personnel.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. Madam Speaker, yesterday was a big day in the Senate for denying and ignoring information and truth and facts about the National Broadband Network. We had, in the morning in room 2S3, Ziggy Switkowski, the chairman of the NBN Co. - one of Australia's leading businessmen - laying out the facts about the NBN rollout. And what did the shadow defence minister have to say, Senator Conroy, appearing there in his shadow shadow role as broadband spokesman? After hours of abuse, he then proceeded to accuse Ziggy Switkowski of lying and misleading the Senate and he refused to retract - one of our most respected businessmen! But then - after being compared in this chamber with Lieutenant Onoda, who fought on in the jungle for 28 years - Senator Conroy careened into the Main Committee room, madder than ever, and then proceeded to accuse Lieutenant-General Campbell of being none other than Colonel Jessup - and he actually said: 'We are living in a movie, and you are Colonel Jessup.' Well, of course, that means that he obviously thought he was the incredibly handsome Daniel Kaffee, played by Tom Cruise. We can all see the resemblance - it's obvious! He can be excused for thinking that.                 When it comes to denial of the facts, I think the better movie analogue is in fact Colonel Kurtz, leading the Labor Party further and further up the Conrovian River into delusion and denial. And you know, we remember the last scenes of that movie, as his temple fortress, his jungle fortress, is being smashed by bombs, fire everywhere, columns falling, walls collapsing - and what does he say? What does Colonel Conroy-Colonel Kurtz say, as he is dragged from the ruins? He says, 'I had immense plans, I had immense plans. I was on the verge of greatness!' Madam Speaker, the real summary of Colonel Conroy's performance are of course the most famous lines in that movie: 'The horror, the horror!'

  Madam Speaker, the minister has not breached the conflict of interest rules. In order to avoid any perception of potential conflict of interest, the staffer in question resigned.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. And I advise the House that, whilst the Leader of the Opposition has a horse running wild in the top paddock, he has a Senate that is not prepared to pass one of the bills that will actually improve economic growth in Australia and create jobs, and that is the bill that repeals the carbon tax. The fact of the matter is that modelling commissioned - not by this government; modelling commissioned by the previous Labor government - identifies that the carbon tax would actually detract from economic growth. It would actually cost jobs. It would actually cost the economy. Now, Labor are sticking like glue to the carbon tax. They own the carbon tax. It is their creation, and they are prepared to die defending the carbon tax. The carbon tax -                      'Hear, hear!', they say, 'Hear, hear!' They are all there defending the carbon tax, which costs jobs, which means less economic growth, and which at the end of the day is going to cost the Australian economy. The cumulative loss of output would be $22 billion by 2020 as a result of the carbon tax. What is more, this will rise to $175 billion as a cost to the Australian economy by 2030. That is in 2012 dollars - $175 billion to the Australian economy by having the carbon tax.                 Yet Labor is determined to fight to the death to keep this tax. You can be sure that, if Labor are ever elected, they will reintroduce the carbon tax. If they are so absolutely committed to the carbon tax here in opposition after losing an election, they would not be afraid to reintroduce it. They would not be afraid to go back and reintroduce it. They might not promise it at the election; we know they have form in that regard. They never tell you about a carbon tax before an election but you can be as sure as the sun will rise up in the morning that they will introduce it after the election, because the carbon tax is in the Labor Party's DNA, even though it costs jobs.                 As New South Wales Treasury said, it is going to cost 31,000 jobs in New South Wales by 2030, and yet Labor is defending this to the death. There is the impact on wages, the impact on industry, and the impact on the health and education sector, which is not compensated for the carbon tax. It flows right through the economy. It flows through to every single area of production, every single area of activity. Yet Labor is defending it to the end. The problem is that the Labor Party does not know what it stands for other than the fact that it is prepared to hit the average Australian worker.

  I can confirm that my office would have been listening to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection on Tuesday afternoon when he said that it was unclear exactly where many of the things that had taken place on that fateful evening had in fact taken place. I will gladly check the record, and, if there is anything to tell the parliament, I will come back and tell the parliament. But, again, exactly what is the evil here? Exactly what is the grievous error? Exactly what is the monument of maladministration that members opposite are trying to uncover? As soon as the minister was aware of a problem on the Monday night he went public, on the Tuesday morning. By the time he got to Canberra on the Tuesday afternoon he was aware that there was some possibility that more information might come to light. He went public with that. On the Saturday, he conclusively discovered -                      Maybe it was midday. Maybe it was one o'clock. Maybe it was two o'clock. It was as soon as he was clear. What does it really matter if he delayed 15 minutes, half an hour or an hour? What does it really matter?                     The truth is that, as soon as he reasonably could be, after clarifying the position, he was completely up-front with the Australian public and the Australian people.                 This minister has a very difficult job, restoring border security with the legacy that this government inherited - a massively difficult job. I want to say that I deeply admire and respect the strength and the integrity that he has brought to this job. While I can understand that members opposite would be a little embarrassed at the way the boats are stopping now, surely they at least ought to be men and women enough to give credit where it is due. This minister is stopping the boats. That is what counts.

  I want to acknowledge the member for Hume and a very distinguished business career in which, throughout that time, he learnt a lot about how to manage businesses. He has always been concerned about bad bills of all kinds, whether they have been bad electricity bills, bad carbon tax bills, bad fuel bills or just plain bad bills. He asks how many businesses are being affected by these bad bills. The answer is not, as they would have us believe on the other side, that 500 firms have been hit by the carbon tax. It is not that 5,000 have been hit by the carbon tax. It is not even that 50,000 have been hit by the carbon tax. According to the Australian Treasury, 75,000 firms have been directly hit by carbon tax bills. More than that, every firm in Australia that consumes electricity or gas is hit by the carbon tax, and every family in Australia that consumes electricity or gas is hit by the carbon tax.                 The question specifically went to manufacturing. As the Clean Energy Regulator set out recently, it is not just a multibillion dollar hit on Australian firms; specifically on manufacturing, it is a $1.1 billion hit. That $1.1 billion includes $596 million in the metals sector for firms such as Rio Tinto and Nyrstar. In the chemical manufacturing sector, there is a $311 million hit for firms such as Incitec Pivot, which provides fertilisers to farmers. In the glass and cement manufacturing sector it is a $30 million hit - CSR, Adelaide Brighton. At a time of massive global pressure, we are putting massive Australian pressure on our manufacturing firms. In the pulp and paper sector, there is another $25 million, and, in food product manufacturing, another $25 million. It is a $1.1 billion manufacturing hit.                 The question then is: with these bills being foisted upon Australian firms, what can we do about it? Come next Monday, when the Senate sits again, it will have been three months that the carbon tax bills have been before the Senate. The Senate, according to this Leader of the Opposition, is on an industrial go-slow. The opposition leader, who has a history of enforcing industrial go-slows, has his senators on a go-slow. Three months and they are not even close to repealing the carbon tax. They are not even close to voting on repeal of the bills. The message is: if you want to do something for Australian manufacturing firms, get out of the way and repeal the bills.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It is a very serious topic. This is a difficult and anxious day for the workers at Qantas - a very difficult and anxious day for them - and it is a very troubling day for everyone who is following this news. I absolutely accept that. I do point out that there are services available to people who lose their jobs, including those at Qantas. I also point out that the fundamental job of government is to ensure that our economy is as strong as possible, and that means getting the fundamentals right. That means trying to ensure that taxes are as low as possible, that regulation is as low as possible, that the ordinary law of the land operates.                 The last thing I am going to do today is to play politics or to try to make capital out of what is a very difficult day. But I am going to provide, as much as I can, hope and confidence to our country. I am going to state my conviction that the management of Qantas are doing their best to ensure that Qantas is stronger in the future than it has been in the recent past, and I am not going to get into the business of being critical of a company and a management which are doing their best to secure the future.                 I want to remind the House that back in 2012, when Qantas announced that 500 jobs were to be lost, the then minister for workplace relations very truly and very correctly pointed out: 'These workers are highly trained and highly skilled. I am sure any prospective employer will get a bargain with these workers.' The minister for employment was right then.                     I grieve with the workers who are facing an uncertain future. But, just as the minister for employment in that government at that time was right then, I am right when I say that there will be better days ahead in a stronger economy when workers can get the jobs they need.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Again, I reiterate that it is a hard day for the workers at Qantas and it is a hard day for everyone who is following this. But on hard days especially it is important to tell the truth, and the truth is that there are services available to people in this country who lose their jobs, and particularly when we are talking about a company like Qantas people's entitlements are absolutely safe.                 But another important truth is that governments do not save businesses. What saves businesses is the management and the staff working together to make the future better than the past.                     It is not government's job to run businesses; it is government's job to get the fundamentals right.                     As this government understands in the marrow of its bones, it is not government that creates jobs; it is profitable businesses that create jobs. It is not government that creates wealth; it is profitable businesses that create wealth. Government's job is to make it easier for those businesses to flourish.                 Our plan for a stronger economy with more jobs starts with abolishing the carbon tax, because let's not forget that the carbon tax is a $9 billion a year tax on jobs and it is a $106 million a year tax on Qantas. It continues with scrapping the mining tax, which has done so much to reduce investment in our country. It goes on with cutting red tape. We are committed to a $1 billion red tape cost saving for the businesses of Australia. We are also committed to trying to ensure that the rule of law operates in all of our workplaces through restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission, and that in a previous incarnation was responsible for $6 billion worth of productivity improvements.                 We will create a million new jobs within five years. We will create two million new jobs within a decade. The challenge of government is not to guarantee every single existing job; the challenge of government is to ensure that there are new and better jobs available to the workers of Australia when they want them and when they need them.

  As the Leader of the Opposition well knows and has just said, this government have been in regular contact with Qantas. As you would expect, we have been in regular contact with Qantas.                     There are a number of things that Qantas would like. This government will do what we can for Qantas consistent with responsible economic management. We are determined to do what we can for Qantas consistent with responsible economic management. That essentially means that we should ensure that Qantas can compete on a level playing field. We want to ensure that Qantas is not competing against its rivals with a ball and chain around its leg. That is what we are trying to ensure.                 As for the other measure that the Leader of the Opposition has sought assurances on, the difficulty is this: what we do for one business, in fairness, we have to make available to all businesses. But I accept that Qantas wants a level playing field, and the government are determined to ensure that it gets an appropriate level playing field. In that sense at least, Qantas does need this government's help. But it also needs the parliament's help. In fact, it needs the opposition's help too. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: join with me in helping Qantas by scrapping the carbon tax and repealing the -

  I thank the member for Ryan for her question. This is certainly a tough day -                      for Qantas and its workers and their families. Indeed, it is an important day for the future of aviation in Australia. It is obviously a particularly difficult time for those families that are uncertain about their future. It is vital that Qantas works constructively with its workforce, the unions and others associated with the industry to try to make the transition that they are going through as smooth and painless as possible.                 The reality is that Qantas plays a vital role in providing air services through our nation and it will have a key role also into the future. This government and all Australians want Qantas to be a strong company in the years ahead so that it can continue to be a national icon known around the world. But the reality is that aviation is changing. New aircraft have modern technology, and so many of the jobs that were required in the past will not be needed in the future. We do not put our cars in for a grease-and-oil change every 1,000 kilometres anymore, and new aircraft are the same. They do not require the same level of service as required in the past. You cannot maintain a 747 maintenance facility if you have only eight aircraft. You cannot open up a new service facility if you have only a dozen 380s. So many of the jobs that were required in the past are not required for the future. New technology is making such a difference.                 Qantas must work its way through these kinds of issues and ensure that it takes control of its own future destiny. The board and the management have a responsibility to the shareholders to make sure that their company is profitable and a national icon to the people of Australia and to ensure that they are able to provide the services that are required.                 But there are more issues than this. The carbon tax will cost Qantas $106 million this year. Next year it will be $168 million. Honourable members opposite think that that is unimportant. Those two numbers together are more than the loss that Qantas announced today. If you look forward over the coming few years, if there were no carbon tax a good quarter of the $3 billion that Qantas want to save would be saved. That $3 billion could be saved if Labor were prepared to vote to get rid of the carbon tax. And the mining tax has similar figures. Labor can help to make Qantas more profitable.

  The shadow minister is misrepresenting my comments. I do not blame the workers for the fact that technology has moved on, that aircraft do not require as much servicing as they previously did. I do not blame the workers for that. That is simply a statement of fact. However, it is important to note that the significant losses that Qantas is currently incurring and which it has incurred over the last year or two have been in its international division. That is where the major difficulties are for Qantas. It is simply beyond dispute that Qantas is faced with the difficulty of having to compete with airlines in countries where the wage structure is very different from what it is in Australia. That is not the fault of our workers. It is a reflection of the fact that there are lower wages paid in other parts of the world. That does not mean that I am arguing that our workers should not be well paid - of course they should be. I want not just our airlines to be prosperous; I want their workers to be prosperous as well.                 But one of the real challenges that Qantas face is that its new competitors are not European airlines or American airlines, where the wage structures are perhaps closer to Australia's; their competitors are from Asia, their competitors are from the Middle East, where the wage structures are different. That is one of the many challenges that Qantas has to face if it is going to be a competitive airline in the years ahead. It has to find ways that it can make up for the fact that costs in Australia are higher, so that it can continue to be competitive in the future. That does not mean that the wage structure in Australia is going to change dramatically. We appreciate that those wages reflect the cost of living and the lifestyle of Australians, which we all enjoy, but it is an issue which Qantas has to address in being a competitive airline globally.                  Leave not granted.

  I do thank the member for Kennedy for his question and I acknowledge his deep commitment to the ethanol industry, which is shared by a number of members in this House, particularly the member for Dawson, who is sitting very close to the member for Kennedy. I wish to make two fundamental points in response to the member for Kennedy. First, this is a government which is determined to keep faith with businesses which have made investment decisions honestly and fairly on the basis of government policy. Second, this is a government which will do its best to ensure as far as is humanly possible a level playing field between the domestically produced and the imported product. We will do our best to ensure that there is a level playing field. As for the policies of the United States and Brazil which the member for Kennedy refers to, I will gladly have a look at those policies and see whether they are instructive for us, but I do have to point out to him and to all members that, in the end, the policy that we adopt in this country, as far as this government is concerned, will be based very much on Australia's national interests.

  I thank the member for Lindsay for her question and recognise that she is obviously very focused on the issues which are directly relevant to the long-term interests of her community. That is unlike her predecessor, who was part of a government that let go of Australia. They lost control of the Australian economy. That was best illustrated by the fact they lost control of the Australian budget. It has just been revealed by the IMF that - under the last Labor regime - for the six years going forward, the legacy of Labor on the budget, from 2012 to 2018, is that we would have the largest increase in spending of the 17 IMF advanced economies profiled. So Labor buried in the budget spending increases faster than any other major advanced economy in the world - more than Korea, Canada, Germany, France or Japan. That is Labor's legacy - big promises, big spending and 'Don't worry about the bills; someone else will have to pay them.'                 The challenge is: we have to rein that in. It is impossible to have an economy saddled with the biggest spending promises of any advanced nation in the world. Labor promised everything but they delivered little. When it comes to productivity, when it comes to the capacity of the Australian economy to produce more, the Labor Party left us behind. In fact, if we want to sustain our national income growth just at our 30-year average, if we want to sustain our quality of life just at our 30-year average, we have to increase labour productivity growth to over three per cent a year. Currently it is stuck at around two per cent. That three per cent would be a historic high.                  What does that legacy mean for Lindsay? Under the infrastructure Prime Minister and the infrastructure government, we will get on with the job of building things like WestConnex. What does that mean? For Western Sydney, WestConnex will allow the constituents of Lindsay to bypass 52 sets of traffic lights and save over 40 minutes on their trips to Sydney. What does that mean for productivity? It means that the trucks and the transport that are driving the Australian economy and the economy of Western Sydney will get a fair go, will get the opportunity to do more with less. That is what it is about. It is a huge task. Instead of the opposition  bleating, I say to the opposition: get on the agenda. We are dealing with your legacy of debt, deficit and structural problems. Get on board with trying to fix it!

  This is a very serious subject and it deserves to be taken extremely seriously by this parliament. This government is determined to ensure that, as far as reasonably possible, there is a level playing field for competition and that Qantas is not competing against its fierce rivals with a ball and chain around its legs. That is what we are determined to ensure. We know that Qantas would like some further additional assistance. The difficulty with that request is this. Why should the government do for one what it is not prepared to do for all? That is the issue. We are determined to help Qantas. We will help Qantas by establishing a level playing field and we will help Qantas by cutting its costs -                    The member for Gellibrand then left the chamber.                     and we will help Qantas by saving it some $270 million in carbon tax costs over two years. That is what we want to do to help Qantas. The government is prepared to help Qantas in these important ways but, for the government to help Qantas, we need the help of the opposition. We need the help of the opposition to sort out the Qantas Sale Act. We need the help of the opposition this side of July to sort out the carbon tax. I ask members opposite: are they prepared to help?

  It is pretty easy to describe the impact of the carbon tax on small business - horrendous! At a time when there is a challenging marketplace, and small business and enterprising people want to create more jobs, to secure more opportunities, they are laden down and held back by a needless tax which is not effective but acts as a disincentive for employment, which impacts on the cost structure of those businesses, which puts our businesses at a disadvantage when they are competing with international businesses that want the markets that we should be able to make our own, to secure job and economic opportunities for us. I was pleased that the member for Barker hosted me at a meeting with small business people in Mt Gambier. The information that came through there was just how tough things were in the local government area of Murray Bridge. The unemployment rate when the previous Labor government was elected was seven per cent. The most recent figure is 9Â½  per cent.                   They are pretty keen, aren't they? Those figures were from June 2012.                     That is always the problem, is it not? I always say to members opposite: don't peak early! The facts matter. We have seen an erosion of employment and an undermining of small business enterprise.                     At that forum and at so many others, dairy farmers like the one the member for Colac and I joined in Colac said, 'What is it about this  Labor Party? Do they not realise that needless cost impacts on small business impact on jobs and viability or do they simply not care?                      It could well be either. It could simply be that Labor does not understand that small business cannot keep getting more and more taxes and more and more burdens.                     I hear the member for Isaacs, a tourist in our region, singing out about us being the government. This government went to the electorate, including to your community where you will not even turn up at your manufacturers because they know how disinterested you are, and we said, 'Let's abolish the carbon tax.' Our plan -                      Pressures on small business are real. Small business people say to me, 'Is it that Labor just don't care or do they not understand it?' They have been warned time and time again that the carbon tax would be an impediment to job creation and prosperity in small business. We have seen 412,000 jobs lost under Labor. We have a chance to end an anti-jobs, anti-small business, anti-growth tax. Those small business people are saying to me, 'Why won't Labor join with the Abbott government in trying to relieve that pressure to reactivate small business, the engine room of the economy?' We say to them, 'We don't know why that is' -                      So the impact of the carbon tax on small business is all bad. It is anti-jobs, it is anti-enterprise, it is anti-growth and it is anti-opportunity. Let me ask the question that is asked of me, 'Why is Labor standing in the way of repealing this tax?' Join jobs; join enterprise; axe the carbon tax.

  On a day when 5,000 jobs have been lost at Qantas, I am a little surprised that the opposition are back on this subject. And I am surprised that the member for Grayndler is not equally surprised after the point of order he has just taken. There was an event - it was such a secret that half the press gallery were at it. It occurred in the election campaign last year. At that event, I announced the coalition's support for $16 million worth of tourism infrastructure in Tasmania. Maybe the member opposite could say whether she supports that $16 million.                     At the event that was so secret that half the press gallery were at it, at the announcement of the grant that was so sinister that it was supported by the people of Tasmania, the role of that gentleman in question, as I understand it, is that he was the economist for the company.

  I particularly want to acknowledge the fact that the member for Eden-Monaro is a distinguished former head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In that role he worked with numerous small, medium and large businesses, and was always concerned about unnecessary bills, electricity bills and bad bills of all kinds. Against that background, on this day of all days, we should all be concerned about unnecessary costs on Australian businesses and Australian workers. The context for this question is against immense global pressure on Australian firms and immense internal pressures on the costs facing Australian firms. These matters define the Australia of today. Global costs and domestic costs, global challenges and domestic challenges - these are the great challenges that we face. Against that background, the question was what steps are we taking to reduce electricity prices?                     Exactly as the Prime Minister promised, the first piece of legislation introduced by this House was repeal of the carbon tax. Exactly as the Prime Minister promised, the first piece of legislation passed by this House was repeal of the carbon tax.                   The member for                    Wakefield                    then left the chamber.                     On 2 December, of which we will face the three-month anniversary next weekend, the Senate received the carbon tax bills. Right now we are waiting for the Leader of the Opposition, who professes his concern about jobs and costs, to do something about jobs and costs. We can actually make a difference to electricity costs, because what was it that the ACT regulator said?                 The Commission estimates that complete removal of the price on carbon _ would reduce retail electricity prices in the ACT by about 12 per cent.                 But it is not just in the ACT. In Queensland, the QCA said, as quoted by the Minister for Trade in Queensland:                 Businesses would save between 7 and 10 per cent on their electricity bills depending on which tariff they are using. The only people standing between small business operators and lower electricity bills are your local Labor Senators                 The head of the ACCC has also said that electricity prices would fall. The head of the Energy Supply Association has also said electricity prices would fall. Only two days ago, what we heard from EnergyAustralia is that they gave their guarantee to pass on the full cost of electricity reductions. If you want lower electricity prices, get the Leader of the Opposition to get out of the way in the Senate.

  I just wish to make two points in response to the member's question. On a day when 5,000 jobs have been lost at Qantas, you would think members opposite would be supporting a job-creating project in Tasmania. I say to the member opposite: if she is serious about this, what is her view? Was this a good proposal or was this a bad proposal?                     The second point I make to the member for Ballarat is that this was a decision taken by the coalition in opposition. It was submitted to the people at the election, and the people supported it.

  I thank the member for her question and remind the House what a tireless worker she is for the people of the Northern Territory. At least that part of the Northern Territory gets excellent representation.                     The people of Darwin are currently being expected by those who sit opposite us to continue to pay for electricity prices at a premium because those who sit opposite do not care what the cost of living is for those people in the Northern Territory. If they care, I ask them to demonstrate that concern by instructing their brothers and sisters in the other chamber to get out of the way and allow us to revoke a carbon tax which the people of Australia were promised by those who sit opposite would never be introduced. They said there would be no carbon tax under the previous Prime Minister's government and yet we know what happened the moment they got into government.                 They have a chance to redeem themselves for a deliberate misstatement by the then Prime Minister about her intentions for what the Labor Party would do when they got into government. They have the opportunity to save the nine entities in the Northern Territory which have been hit with a carbon bill of over $66 million. They have a chance to redeem themselves - it is a small chance, but they have a chance. All they have to do is say -                      You got thrown out last time, mate; go again.                      The Labor Party is more than happy to sit by and watch the Northern Territory Power and Water Corporation being -                    The member for Charlton                    then                    left the chamber.                     Everyone gets what they deserve, Madam Speaker.                 The Northern Territory Power and Water Corporation is being served a carbon tax bill of $20.3 million, and those who sit opposite are happy to see that happen. They are happy to see Santos QNT pay a bill of half a million dollars, Newmont pay a bill of $1.5 million, and EDL NGD pay a bill of $4.6 million. That is millions and millions of dollars that end up being charged against the consumers of electricity and power in the Northern Territory. Do the right thing.

  I am happy to do my best with all this, but I think I should point out to the House that this really does go to the judgement of the opposition. On a day when 5,000 jobs have been lost at Qantas, this is the best the opposition can do -                      to flog this particular dead horse, and dead horse it is.                     This $16 million grant towards tourism infrastructure in Tasmania was designed to boost employment and help the Tasmanian economy. This suggestion that there was something improper about this grant I deeply reject. I deeply reject it. There was absolutely nothing improper about this. It was so secret that it was taken to the election!                     It was so secret it was announced before half of the press gallery! It will benefit jobs and workers in Tasmania and I call on the opposition to support it.

  I thank the member for Cowan for his question and I recognise the deep respect that he has for our defence forces and the work that they do around the world. Indeed, as the member for Cowan knows, our defence forces are deeply respected in the region for the humanitarian work that they carry out at the direction of the Australian government. Recently in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan, 550 of our finest men and women worked to redress that humanitarian disaster. Indeed, our men and women are respected globally for defending Australia's interests and upholding our values.                 That is why we on this side are deeply concerned that the shadow minister for defence is refusing to redress the 'extreme offence' - those were the words used by General Angus Campbell - felt by General Campbell after Senator Conroy's outrageous slur, indeed the libel, that he uttered against General Campbell, designed to dishonour an honourable man. As the Chief of Defence, David Hurley, said, referring to Senator Conroy's defamatory words:                 I was surprised at the accusations made against Lieutenant General Angus Campbell. I am pleased that these accusations were withdrawn. But, unfortunately, once they are said, the shadow will linger. Lieutenant General Campbell has a reputation - in Canberra, more widely in Australia, and overseas - of integrity, intellect and studied impartiality.                 I should not have to point this out, but when a slur or a libel or a defamation is uttered not only should the offending words be withdrawn but an apology should be offered to redress the hurt and the offence felt by those who have been libelled.                 Labor is making a bad situation worse, for yesterday, in the debate on the motion by the Independent member for Denison, the Leader of the Opposition made his own outrageous slur against Senator Michael Ronaldson that not only reflected on Senator Ronaldson but also reflected on former Chief of Army Ken Gillespie. The Leader of the Opposition falsely claimed that, in estimates, Senator Ronaldson had called General Gillespie a coward. That was a false claim. After Senator Ronaldson demanded a retraction, hours later the Leader of the Opposition crept in just before the close of the House's business and apologised, but he did not withdraw the false allegation, so that allegation stands.                     So that was a false claim, and after Senator Ronaldson demanded a retraction -                      Thank you, Speaker. I now note that the Leader of the Opposition apologised last night and now has withdrawn the words. I accept that and I am sure Senator Ronaldson will. But what he must now do is direct Senator Conroy to withdraw the words and apologise, and I give him an opportunity to do so now.

  I do thank the member for Grayndler for his question. I point out that the $16 million was a tourism infrastructure grant. It was an election commitment. We made it in the context of an election. We made it openly and publicly. It was so secret that it was witnessed by half the press gallery. It was so sinister that it was approved by the people of Australia at an election. And let me remind the member for Grayndler and all those other rather noisy members opposite: the member for Franklin described the project as 'a great project that gets our support'. Well, get behind it. It is a good project and it will create jobs.

  I thank the member for Bonner for his question. It is true that Australian workers do deserve the highest levels of probity in the management of the union movement. The royal commission does create the opportunity to root out corruption in the union movement. Let's put this in perspective. Even after the scandals involving the HSU were public, Kathy Jackson described this scene at the 2011 HSU council meeting in Sydney:                 There would have been 900 delegates _ I kid you not _ This is after I went to the police _ (Michael) Williamson got a standing ovation _ they played the Rocky theme when he walked in _ there were people heckling me and screaming at me and _ Marco Bolano _ that I was a traitor to the movement _ people were calling out 'Judas' from the crowd _ this went on for _ hours.                 It is that level of delusion in the union movement that the royal commission will help root out so that Australian workers get representation from their union leaders that is genuine and real, and not the kind of scandalous grubbiness that we saw in the HSU.                  But what is standing in the way of being able to achieve this? What is standing in the way is the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is opposing the royal commission. He is opposing the Australian Building and Construction Commission being reoriented. He is opposing the Registered Organisations Commission. But, also, yesterday he refused to do what he himself did. Yesterday he apologised and withdrew for saying something was untrue in this place about Senator Ronaldson, but he will not require the same of Senator Conroy. What is good for him should be good for Senator Conroy - what is good for the goose should be good for the gander. Why can't he do it? Because he is the factions' choice, not the people's choice.                     Correct, Madam Speaker, and I am being very relevant. What is standing in the way of being able to deliver probity in the union movement is the connection, the umbilical cord, between Labor and the trade union movement. The Leader of the Opposition will not discipline Senator Conroy because he cannot. He is the factions' choice - there is the people's choice! The member for Grayndler surprised even me -                      Madam Speaker, I am explaining the relevance. The point is that the Leader of the Opposition cannot act because he is a union official first, representing union officials. That is why he will not act against the factional boss Senator Conroy - because he is the factions' choice, not the people's choice. He is not pretty but he is the people's choice.

  Every single person in this House is concerned about the predicament that those 5,000 workers find themselves in. But the whole point of government is not to guarantee every single job - no government can do that. The point of being in office is not to run a chequebook government. The point of being in government is to get the fundamentals right, and that is what this government is trying to do. We want to get taxes down, we want to get to regulation down, we want to get productivity up -                      I am fighting to ensure that Qantas gets a fair go. I am fighting to ensure that Qantas is not shackled by a $106 million carbon tax bill one year and a $168 million carbon tax bill the next year. I am fighting to ensure that as far as is humanly possible Qantas is operating on a level playing field, and the last thing that I want to do on a difficult and anxious day for Qantas is to make political capital out of the difficulty that this business finds itself in. That is the last thing I want to do.                      I absolutely accept that Qantas would like the government's help. The help I am offering is to level the playing field and save Qantas from costs which it should not face. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to join with me and to give this great Australian icon the legislative help that it needs. That is what we should all be doing in this parliament today - giving this great Australian icon the legislative help that it needs. It is a difficult and anxious day for Qantas; there is no doubt about that. But our duty in this parliament is to ensure that Qantas is stronger tomorrow than it was yesterday, and that is what I am determined to do.

  I thank the member for Swan for his question and his keen interest in this issue. I said once before in this place that I would not be running a shipping news service for people smugglers. But there is no shipping news to give, because for the past 10 weeks - for the last 70 days - there has not been a single successful people-smuggling venture to Australia. I note that 70 days was the amount of time the Manager of Opposition Business served as Minister for Immigration up until the election - 70 days. In the last 70 days we have not had a successful people-smuggling venture come to Australia.                 I am asked about the key factors that have produced this outcome. I would suggest the following. Firstly, there are the people in the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, our Navy, our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. These are the people who go out there every day and implement good policy. That is what they do. They are doing a sterling job despite what Senator Conroy might say or others might choose to reflect on in other places. They are doing an outstanding job.                 The other thing that has been a key factor in the success has been the policies themselves. One thing that those opposite do not seem to understand is that we have the same people that they had to do the job, we are faced with the same challenges that they were faced with to do the job and the problem was as great; the circumstances were different. But there is one thing that is very different, and that is that the policies are different. The policies that those people are putting in place are different. The most significant one that has had the impact on the success over the last 70 days has been our operations at sea. Operations, which -                      I will be specific, for the member for Isaacs: denying illegal entry of vessels into our waters and removing them from those waters. That is our policy, and that is exactly what we are doing -                      You said - through you, Madam Speaker - all of them said, that it could not be done! It could never be done! They came up with excuse after excuse after excuse for why it could not be done, and the boats just turned up, didn't they - day after day after day? The third ingredient was the result of a government which believed in policies that would work and wanted to address the problem.                 So it has been the people, it has been the policies under this government and it has been the resolve of a government which believes in the policies we are implementing that mean we and can give those good people - whether they are in our Navy or our Customs and Border Protection - the support they need to get the job done. And 70 days, and counting, on, they are getting that job done.

  Well, no, I will not. Let me say of the Commission of Audit -                      I am happy to elaborate. I am very happy to elaborate and to say why we will not. It might surprise members opposite, but this is a policy that I deeply believe in. This is a policy that I announced on International Women's Day in 2010. This is a policy that the coalition took to the 2010 election. This is a policy which the coalition expounded and defended throughout the last term of parliament. This is a policy which we took to the election. And, I have to say, this is a policy which the Australian public well and truly understood when they voted in last year's election.                 This is a policy whose time has come. It is a policy that will deliver an historic reform for the women of Australia. I think that one day members opposite will be a little embarrassed at the stance that they have taken on this policy. I believe that the women of Australia should have a real choice to combine family with career. They should have a real choice to combine family with career, and that is exactly what this policy gives them.                 This is an historic change. This is a mighty social and economic advance for the women of Australia. It is good for women, it is good for families and it is very good for our economy, because if we can get the participation rate up we will get our productivity up, we will get our prosperity up and it will be good for everyone. I absolutely stand by this policy.

  I thank the member the Hughes for this question. I acknowledge that he has personally shown me the effects of illicit drugs within his own electorate.                     Perhaps I could have phrased that better, but I think the House knows what I mean. This is a very serious issue. Strong and prosperous communities are central to our government's plan to build a better Australia. Too many of the lives of our communities around the country are blighted by organised crime. It remains a serious threat to the social and economic fabric of Australia.                 The Australian Crime Commission recently noted that organised crime costs our community up to $15 billion a year, and the illicit drug market remains the principal source of income for organised criminals. It is this government's commitment to take steps to strike at the heart of this market and to give the law enforcement agencies the resources and the powers they need to go after organised criminals and drug dealers. This is a change in direction for this government compared to that of the previous government, which, budget after budget, cut the resources to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. I am pleased to report to the House the significant work that has been done in targeting the illicit drug market in the past short while.                 In the six months to January this year, federal law enforcement agencies seized over $1 billion worth of illicit drugs. This is $1 billion that has been taken out of the criminal economy and over three tonnes of drugs that are not circulating on our streets. Cocaine seized was over one tonne, with a street value of $427 million. Over one tonne of precursor chemicals have been seized, with a street value of $220 million. Specific operations include Task Force Eligo, which, while being primarily aimed at money-laundering, has resulted in the seizure of over half a billion dollars of illicit drugs, the seizure of $26 million of cash and the restraint of more than $30 million worth of criminal assets.                 Imagine what could have been achieved if the previous government had not cut savagely the budget of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The Australian Crime Commission, the body that is tasked with fighting organised crime, had its budget cut by 30 per cent under the previous government - 30 per cent. It had its personnel cut by 30 per cent under the previous government, and yet they have still managed to do an extraordinary job in tackling organised crime and tackling the illicit drug market. The Australian Federal Police had their budget cut by $128 million under the previous government, and I congratulate both of these agencies for what they have been able to achieve even though the previous government tied one hand behind their backs.                 The new government will tackle organised crime and the illicit drugs market, and we will support the agencies that are tasked with doing it.

  The situation in the Ukraine is fluid and it is threatening. It is something that all Australians are rightly concerned about and that people right around the world are rightly concerned about. I can inform the House that this morning the Russian ambassador was called into the department of foreign affairs to be told in no uncertain terms what Australia thinks about this aggression against an independent country. I can inform the House that a visit to Russia by the Minister for Trade and Investment will not go ahead and I can further inform the House that a visit to Australia by the Russian national security adviser likewise will not go ahead.                 Unprovoked aggression should have no place in our world. Russia should back off; it should withdraw its forces from the Ukraine. The people of the Ukraine ought to be able to determine their future themselves. That is what should happen.

  I thank the member for Brisbane for her question. I assure her that, as far as the government is concerned, there should be no talking down of a great Australian airline. Qantas is a great Australian airline. It is an airline with a great past and an airline which should have a great future. Australians love to travel. We love to travel domestically; we love to travel internationally. The market for Australian travel should increase as the years go by. This means there is absolutely no reason, whatsoever, why Qantas and all other Australian airlines should not have a great future, except for the shackles that legislation has placed not just on Qantas but on all Australian airlines. I refer particularly to the carbon tax - the tax that members opposite said was never going to happen; the tax that members opposite said had been terminated in the middle of last year. That tax is so terminated that last financial year Qantas paid $106 million in carbon tax; Virgin paid almost $50 million in carbon tax and even Rex paid more than $2 million in carbon tax. The best thing that this parliament can do for the airline industry right now is axe the tax. I will quote Virgin CEO John Borghetti, who is someone who knows a bit about airlines. He works for Virgin but he has worked for Qantas. He said:                 _ the best assistance the government and the opposition can provide is the removal of the carbon tax, which has cost this industry hundreds of millions of dollars. To that end, I just say we applaud the government's position on this.                 There is something that this parliament can do today. There are bills in the Senate right now that are specifically directed not at the overall repeal of the carbon tax but at repealing the carbon tax on airlines. I know that the Leader of the Opposition likes the carbon tax, generally, but if he wants to help the airline industry he should let us pass those bills that will take the carbon tax off the airlines. I am happy to work with the Leader of the Opposition to free the airline industry from the carbon tax today. I would like to free everyone from the carbon tax, but let us work together on just this one thing - that is, to look after the jobs at Qantas by taking the carbon tax off the workers there.

  Of course I agree with the Treasurer! There is never a moment when I do not agree with the Treasurer.                     I tell you what, does the Leader of the Opposition agree with his shadow minister that the government is the major shareholder in Qantas? Does the Leader of the Opposition agree with his shadow minister that the Commonwealth has a majority share in Qantas? This is not something that the shadow minister said in 1994; he said it today.                     Madam Speaker, I was asked about disagreements between party leaders and their frontbenchers, and here is a classic case - a classic case of a senior frontbencher who has not realised that two decades have gone by since the Labor Party sold Qantas lock, stock and barrel into the private sector. He is still living in the good old days of state-owned airlines. We are not.                     Unlike members opposite, who are completely clueless when it comes to the facts of the aviation industry in this country, we will make sure as far as we humanly can that we give all the airlines of this country the support they need to keep going, and the best support we can do is to take the carbon tax off them - a $100 million a year hit on the workers of Qantas. The Leader of the Opposition supports it but we oppose it and we will free the workers of Qantas from this $100 million a year tax on their jobs.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and I acknowledge that he is deeply concerned, as are other members who have Ukrainian communities in their electorate, about the escalating crisis that we see in Ukraine. I can confirm, as the Prime Minister has, that both sides of the House are gravely concerned about the escalation that we have seen - an escalation in Russian military activity, an escalation in tensions. In recent days the Russian parliament has authorised the use of force inside Ukraine. This is a significant but wholly unacceptable development. It undermines the right of the Ukrainian people to choose their own destiny. The Australian government has urged Russia to withdraw its troops, to step back from Ukraine and to de-escalate its activities that are persisting in this unfolding crisis. We are particularly concerned that the new Ukrainian government requested urgent talks with the Russian Federation. This request was rebuffed outright. We are greatly concerned that the lines of communication between the parties be kept open. This is a time for diplomacy and dialogue.                  We join with the international community in calling on the Russian Federation to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and its territorial integrity. In particular, we are calling on the new government of Ukraine to continue to exercise restraint in the face of provocation. Today, on my direction, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade called in the Russian ambassador to formally register our concerns with the Russian government and to ascertain the intentions of the Russian government in this matter. We will continue to maintain that dialogue. Over the past 48 hours, the United Nations Security Council has also met on two occasions. Our ambassador to the United Nations, our permanent representative, Ambassador Gary Quinlan, has given a clear, unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian people, and that is that we support Ukraine's sovereignty. The use of force is utterly unacceptable. It is contrary to the UN charter of rights and it is contrary to international agreements that Russia has signed to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty. We will remain in very close contact with our friends and allies and the members of the UN Security Council.                  I urge Australians thinking of travelling to Ukraine and the surrounding area to log on to the government's Smartraveller website. The travel advisory will be updated; it will be under constant review as the situation changes. This is an extremely volatile, fluid situation and extreme caution must be exercised. I will keep the House informed of any further developments.

  We are more than happy, as the Treasurer has abundantly made clear, to take the shackles off Qantas. That is what we want to do. We want to get rid of the carbon tax, which is a $100 million-plus hit on Qantas jobs, and we do want to remove from Qantas the shackles placed upon it by the Qantas Sale Act. Again I say to Leader of the Opposition: if he is fair dinkum about wanting to help the workers at Qantas, if he is fair dinkum about wanting to do the right thing by Qantas - make Qantas more competitive and more efficient in these difficult days - he should work with the government to decouple the bills in the Senate so that this very day we can free all of the airlines of this country from the carbon tax. The only thing stopping that is the Leader of the Opposition.                     What members opposite essentially want the government to do is provide to one airline what we would not provide to all. What this government wants to do is ensure that all airlines are given the level playing field that they deserve. Unlike members opposite who believe in chequebook government and playing favourites amongst businesses, we do not. We want to give all airlines a fair go, and that includes Qantas.                     Regardless of what it is?

  I thank the member for Forde for the question. He is known to all of us as 'Bert the Beattie Beater'! He does care about the aviation industry in Australia, which has grown in domestic passenger numbers since 2005 by 4.5 per cent per annum and in international passenger numbers since 2005 at an average of 5.1 per cent per annum. I am glad I was asked a question by someone in this House about all my words in relation to Qantas. It is no secret that Qantas has been having some challenges over the last few years. In fact, in his recent public statement, the chief executive of Qantas recognised that they have been speaking to governments about the challenges for two years.                 I came across a letter of comfort from the member for Grayndler.                      There he is! This was a letter of comfort from the Australian taxpayers to Qantas to try and reassure the rating agencies that the government would stand behind Qantas. I bet that was not just something given out to every business in Australia. No, there must have been some reason why the member for Grayndler would write a letter like that, and I am sure he spoke to all of his colleagues. But, of course, all the problems of Qantas are a rude shock to Labor. They still think its in government ownership. The should call a shareholders meeting to address their problems!                 But there is more because Labor just does not deal with the facts. Today, when I heard the member for Grayndler say, 'Part of the obligations in the Qantas Sale Act are for regional services and the regional network,' I rushed to my copy of the Qantas Sale Act and could not see anything there about it. There was nothing in the act about regional services. He was a transport minister for six years and never read the Qantas Sale Act.                 But there is more. This guy over here, the member for McMahon, was the Treasurer and he went on the doors today and said, 'A debt guarantee - you don't need legislation for that.' But you do because you cannot appropriate money if you do not have legislation and you cannot give a guarantee that means anything if you do not have an appropriation. So you have a former Treasurer who does not understand the facts, a former transport minister who does not understand the facts and a frontbench that still thinks they own Qantas. The bottom line is that, as the chief executive of Virgin and the chief executive of Qantas said, the best thing you can do for the aviation industry is get rid of the carbon tax now.

  I have two points in response to the Leader of the Opposition: first of all, he should stop verballing the Treasurer and, secondly, he should stop talking down Qantas. That is what he should do. He should stop talking down Qantas. If he is serious about helping Qantas today, this very day he should join with the government and lift the carbon tax from Qantas and all other airlines.

  I thank the member for his question. The death of Mr Berati is a tragedy. It is a terrible tragedy. It is as tragic as the 1,200 other deaths that occurred over the last five years. All of those deaths were no less tragic than that of Mr Berati - the children who died at sea were of the some 8,000 who got on boats over the last five years, when the previous government joined up with the Greens to abolish the measures that worked under the Howard government. They abolished them.                 The situation on Manus Island has been very difficult - it has. The previous government put in place arrangements on Manus Island. They put in place all of the arrangements and all of the contractors that were present on that night. Soon after becoming the Minister for Immigration, I went to Manus Island and one of the first things that was presented to me was the issue of security in the compound. As a result of that we commissioned a force protection assessment review and started taking immediate steps to improve the security of that compound. I believe that the steps we took over the ensuing four to five months saved lives on that night.                 Managing a centre in a situation like that, where there are rising tensions - where we have been working for months to try to put in place the details of the resettlement arrangements and the processing arrangements on Manus Island that were left undone by the previous government - has led to the increase in tensions in that place. We are working on that, but it remains the case that if there is riotous behaviour and if there are people who are not cooperating with the care and support that is being provided to them in centres then the risk in those centres inevitably goes up.                 We have been working to reduce that risk. The report which we have announced and put in place is now going to be conducted in partnership with the government of Papua New Guinea. The police investigation which is underway there and the coronial inquiry will get to the facts. They will get to the facts. We will know what happened on that night. I am not going to speculate on the conduct of any individuals on that night, but the report will find out and I will wait for the report to find out.

  I thank the member for Durack who, arguably, would travel longer by air than anyone to be here week by week. She fully understands the importance of aviation in regional communities and in linking regional Australia to the rest of the nation.                 The aviation sector is vital to the national economy. It behoves us all to take note when the aviation industry has reported a loss in the first half year for the first time in more than a decade. The reality is that the carbon tax is bleeding this industry. The carbon tax is adding to its costs - costs which cannot be added on to consumers. The cost is not just the direct cost that the airlines have to pick up through their fuel bills but it is also the impact on tourism, and the fact that we have been made less competitive as a country as a result of the carbon tax.                 There is the mining tax as well. It means that fewer people fly, and so the airlines have been left in a less profitable position. The CEO of Virgin nailed it, John Borghetti, when he made it absolutely clear that it was the carbon tax that was the most important thing that governments could do to make a difference to the airlines, and that it was making a substantial contribution to Virgin's drop in profitability.                     The member for Grayndler is the man who thinks that the Qantas Sale Act is about regional services, when they are not even mentioned in the act. When he was minister for transport, he said, 'The impact of the carbon tax will be little more than the cost of a cup of coffee.' Little more than the cost of a cup of coffee! Well, for Rex in the first half year the cost was $1.3 million! For Virgin it was $27 million in the first half year, and for Qantas it was $106 million in the year. I do not know when the shadow minister last bought a cup of coffee, but it was a very, very expensive cup of coffee! If it is so insignificant, why won't Labor join us in getting rid of the carbon tax? Get rid of the carbon tax!                 The member for Gorton thinks that the government owns the airline. Five times he said on Sunday television that the government was the majority shareholder. Where was he when Paul Keating and Bob Hawke sold off every share in Qantas? The opposition is so out of touch, so lacking in understanding of the aviation sector. That is the only way they could be denying what the industry wants most. There is something they can do just as well as the government: that is, to vote against the carbon tax. Get rid of the carbon tax and that will be a major stride forward for the aviation industry and its profitability in Australia.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. We know that he does not understand the aviation legislation, but maybe he should read the Air Navigation Act which makes it absolutely clear that if you want to be a national carrier for Australia, fly international routes and exercise Australian landing rights, you have to be majority owned in Australia. So for all of our national carriers, their international arm must be majority owned by Australians. That is not only laid down in our own legislation but is also a part of the international conventions we have signed in relation to these types of issues.                     The second part of his question relates to regional Australian air services, which are not mentioned in the Qantas Sale Act. The reality is that regional aviation in Australia, the QantasLink services operated by Qantas, has been trading profitably over recent times. Rex is the only airline in Australia that actually reported a profit for the half year. It was a tiny one, but at least they reported a profit. Of course, Virgin is expanding strongly into regional areas because they also believe that regional Australia is a great place in which to operate air services. So I am confident -                      that regional airlines, without the burden of a carbon tax, can trade profitably into the future.                     They can provide services in regional communities, and the opposition can help to make that a certainty. They can vote down the carbon tax. Get rid of the carbon tax - then Rex, Qantas and Virgin, in their regional services, will be more profitable than they are today.

  I am very pleased to take this question from the member for Petrie because he, like this side of the House, recognises that the carbon tax is having a very real and negative impact on jobs in the airline industry. In fact, in the last financial year it was a $106 million negative impact on Qantas and $45 million impact on Virgin, leading John Borghetti, the CEO of Virgin, to say on Friday: 'The best assistance the government and the opposition can provide is the removal of the carbon tax which has cost this industry hundreds of millions of dollars.'                 Now the opposition could fix this today. We have a lot of crocodile tears from the Leader of the Opposition; a lot of wringing of hands from the opposition about jobs at Qantas. As the Minister for Education, representing for the Minister for Employment, I say that this side of the House has legislation ready to go that would assist Qantas and Virgin and jobs in the airline industry today. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 sit in the Senate being debated as we speak. Both of those bills could be separated out from the rest of the carbon tax repeal legislation and passed today by the combined votes of the government and the opposition. If the opposition really cared about jobs in the airline industry they would stop the rhetoric, they would actually measure up and they would indicate - and I give the opportunity to the Leader of Opposition to do so at the end of this answer - that they will help Qantas and Virgin today by repealing the carbon tax on the airline industry.                 I suspect they will not. I suspect that the Leader of the Opposition is more concerned about the Qantas unions than he is about Qantas workers. This is his big opportunity, but I suspect he will not do it because he said in February 2013: 'I am very proud to carry into the Parliament of Australia every day, my union membership card.' Now here we are again -                      'Hear, hear!', they are all saying. They are delighted. They should table this, as union members. Has he got it on him or was he just making that up? Does he walk in here with his union membership card? Why does he not walk in here with his 'putting Australia first' card or his 'putting the Qantas workers first' card, rather than his employment union membership card?                     The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is he cannot forget his background. He cannot rise above being a union official representing union officials. But this is a big test for him.                     If he really cares about Qantas workers, he will put aside his union membership card and vote the carbon tax through in the Senate.

 We wish to free the workers of Qantas from a $100 billion hit on their jobs. We want to do it today.                     We want to do it today, and I say to the Leader of the Opposition: he should stop huffing and puffing. Just for once he should be useful. Just for once he should leave the union card at home and he should get out of the way, let the carbon tax repeal legislation go through the Senate and take this $100 million tax off Qantas workers.

  The answer is: Western Australian families, Western Australian workers and Western Australian firms. I want to thank the member for Pearce. He is a multitalented member of parliament. He was Treasurer of WA. Many would say he is extremely good-looking, in my office; charming; intelligent and, above all else, somebody concerned about electricity bills and bills of all sorts.                     The member opposite wants to do something that is all about action, not talk. Right on this day, he can have his senators walk into the Senate, get out of the way, repeal the carbon tax and, in particular, repeal the fuel tax bills on Qantas, Virgin and Rex. If you care about action, not talk, it is right there - it is available today, this very moment.                 In terms of Western Australia, the question was: what are we able to do to help Western Australian firms? The Clean Energy Regulator was absolutely clear. There are 63 major firms in WA today that are directly paying the carbon tax. Western Australian firms, however, are part of the 75,000 that are paying the diesel tax. And, more than that, Western Australian firms, along with all other Australian firms, are paying it through their electricity, gas and refrigeration costs.                 More than that again - let's go to the details - when you look at the Western Australian figures, you see that we have $4.1 billion of national electricity costs because of the carbon tax: $200 million for the Electricity Generation Corporation in WA alone and $60 million for Bluewaters Power station. Then, beyond that, we go to mining and manufacturing and the way they have been hit. In LNG, Woodside energy has a $172 million carbon tax bill. In alumina, a sector under enormous pressure, BHP's Worsley alumina refinery has a $56 million bill. In fertilisers, the Yara Pilbara operation has a $35 million tax. The state government is hit with $50 million of direct costs in terms of schools, hospitals and police and emergency services. And this is the tax that you want to keep on schools, hospitals, police and emergency services. That is what the modern Labor Party has come to - a tax on the most basic services at state level. We then go to the fact that every Western Australian household will be part of the benefit of $550 per household per year if we get rid of the carbon tax. So, if the Leader of the Opposition wants action, not talk, he should go to his senators, get them off strike and get out of the way.

  I do want Qantas to call Australia home, and I do want Qantas to flourish into the future. But the best thing we can do to help Qantas to call Australia home, not just now but forever -                      is to remove the shackles which are holding Qantas back. The Leader of the Opposition is complaining on behalf of Qantas. I want to work on behalf of Qantas. I want this parliament to work on behalf of Qantas by, this very day, repealing the carbon tax and taking that $100 million hit off Qantas and off Qantas workers.

  I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and recognise that he knows, like most Australians know, that having responsible economic management is closely linked to responsible management of the budget. As I advised the House last week, the recent IMF assessment of comparisons between the 17 key economies identified that the Labor Party had locked in, from 2012, the largest percentage increase in spending of any of the top 17 countries in the world. Understand this: the Labor Party locked in increases in government expenditure at a higher rate than any other developed economy in the world - of the top 17 IMF countries identified. Our spending is growing faster than that of Korea, Canada, Germany, France and Japan. Some of those countries are printing money, they are spending so quickly. The Labor Party locked us in to the highest expenditure growth of any of the top 17 countries. But now there is more: the IMF has released a further assessment that says, 'For the six years 2012-18, Australia is forecast to have the third largest increase in net debt as a percentage of GDP.'                 This is the legacy of Labor. They lock in expenditure growth at record levels and they lock in debt increases at record levels. Then they are in shock when savings have to be made to the budget and they are in shock when taxation increases. Labor do not have restraint. As we have heard today, senior Labor ministers in the previous government did not even understand their own portfolios, yet they act surprised when they see that the budget is forecast for 10 years of deficit - $123 billion of deficits over the next four years alone and $667 billion of debt. That is the legacy of Labor.                 We are up for the task of fixing this mess. We are determined to fix the mess that Labor left behind. To the Labor Party: if it has not been sobering enough for you to lose an election, just walk down to the Senate and help us pass $20 billion of savings that we promised to help fix up the budget now.

  The basic problem for Qantas is that the party opposite that sold Qantas are not prepared to free Qantas. That is what should happen. Qantas should be free to compete, to survive and to flourish. That is what this government wants to do. One thing I am not going to do is stand at this dispatch box and do what members opposite have done for the last week or so. I am not going to talk Qantas down; I am going to allow Qantas to compete on a level playing field with every other airline in this country, because I have confidence in the workers of Qantas and I have confidence in the staff of Qantas. Unshackle Qantas and they can continue to be one of the world's great airlines.

  The member for Adelaide is welcome to ask me a question if she could get one up in the tactics committee. Perhaps not after the last disaster! I am very pleased to report that support for the government's IR move to the sensible centre is coming from Labor figures who would not necessarily normally support the government. In February just passed, Paul Howes, Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, said:                 Some will tell you that our industrial relations system is dragging us down.                 And I won't be popular amongst my friends in the labour movement for saying this - but I agree.                 And we agree with Paul Howes. But last week at the CEDA conference in Perth, a most unlikely source of support came for the coalition's position on Fair Work and on the Australian Building and Construction Commission, and that came from Martin Ferguson, the very well respected former cabinet minister in the last Gillard and Rudd governments - one of the lions of the labour movement. He said at the CEDA conference, 'The ABCC is a mechanism that holds both sides to account and which can help deliver projects on time and on budget.' He also said: 'The government has tabled some changes to the FWA to bring into effect their pre-election policy commitments. While the changes are a step in the right direction they are really quite modest.'                 So we have support from Martin Ferguson, the better side of the gene pool of the Ferguson brothers in this place. But what did Brendan O'Connor, the shadow minister for workplace relations, instantly say? He told Sky News that he was very disappointed that Mr Ferguson had joined the other side. Following up his remarks about Qantas being owned by the Australian taxpayer, his response was to attack Martin Ferguson, a lion of the Labor Party. But Joel Fitzgibbon rode in to defend Martin Ferguson. He said that Martin had been sharing these views publicly and privately for a very long time.                     It was the member for Hunter who starkly reminded the public of the choice facing the Leader of the Opposition - either he chooses to continue with a future shackled by the trade union movement, believing that they can force the economy to fit the union movement, or he can go forward into the future with a positive plan, as enunciated by the member for Hunter, which is to understand that the union movement is not the be-all of the economy in Australia. This is very difficult for the Leader of the Opposition because, as he said, he is union first, union second and union third. He said, 'I am very proud to wear into the parliament of Australia every day my union membership card.' It is time for him to put this - are you coming up to table his card? Has he shared it with you, because you are the people's choice and he is the faction's choice? The people's choice is riding in to defend the faction's choice!

  Regardless of which portfolio the money comes from, it is a great investment. How do I know? Because the shadow minister sitting opposite, the member who has asked the question, said that it is 'a great project, that gets our support'. Senator Urquhart, ALP Senator for Tasmania and Deputy Opposition Whip, said, 'Of course I welcome this announcement. I welcome investment in the Claremont site.' But listen to this: the Premier of Tasmania, who the Leader of the Opposition was with just this weekend, said 'I welcome this potential investment in Cadbury. It is fantastic.'

  I would like to thank the member for Ryan. This is a most appropriate question from someone who set up Conventions Queensland over 25 years ago and, from a room in the front of her house, established one of Queensland's leading management and events tourism businesses.                 Trade and investment are two crucial factors in seeking to meet the challenge of restoring sustainable growth and sustainable jobs. China, as our biggest training partner, is a big part of that challenge. There is great scope to widen and to deepen our relationship because China's economy is changing. China is moving from a focus on exports -                      and shifting to a focus on domestic spending by way of the exploding middle class.                     Retail sales in China last year increased by 13 per cent, the opposite of what we saw in Australia under those on the other side. This will open up new opportunities for Australia across many areas in line with our strengths. That is why today the Prime Minister announced that, from 8 to 11 April this year, we will take a very big business group, which I will lead in association with Australia Week in China, involving the Prime Minister as part of his broader North Asian involvement. This trip will have industry-themed events across four major cities. It will involve hundreds of business people from Australia - 350 have already nominated - and it will reflect our nation's strengths: things such as agribusiness, mining, health, tourism, food, urban planning and architecture.                     It builds on our efforts to conclude a free trade agreement, which has been under negotiation since 2005 and is yet to be completed.                     It is on the back of an agreement with Korea, which those on the other side sought to negotiate for years without success. And we are working hard to complete the Japanese free trade agreement. All of these activities are an important part of giving us the opportunity for trade and investment, which will help us fix the mess that those on the other side created for this country. It is a critical issue, alongside the carbon and mining taxes. It is a very clear message for Australians.

  No, I will not, but I think that the shadow minister should stop making herself unpopular with her colleagues.

  I thank the member for Page for the question. The Leader of the Opposition may be very interested to know the answer to this question that the member for Page has asked because last year, back in November, he said:                 There's no doubt in my mind that the coalition's boat person policy is absolutely not working.                 That is what the Leader of the Opposition said last November. He may like to know that for the last 74 days there has not been a single successful people-smuggling venture make it to Australia. He may also be interested to know that over that same 74 days, when those opposite were running border protection, there were 33 vessels and 1,756 arrivals over that same period of time.                 This may be news to those opposite, that that is what success looks like, but those opposite did not get to know what success looked like because, year after year, their policy failures led to boat after boat arriving. We have been able to achieve the success we have achieved so far - and there is further to go - because of a number of policies. But the one that has been most effective over the last 74 days has been what we are doing at sea. It is interesting to note that the shadow minister said of our policy in relation to turn backs:                 Turning back the boats was always a furphy.                 The former minister, the now shadow Treasurer, and the member for McMahon said Tony Abbott's policy of turning back the boats will not work. That is what he said: he said it will not work. He said:                 I look forward to an explanation today or alternatively, them facing a dose of reality for a change and dropping this policy.                 Here is the dose of reality: 74 days with not a single successful people-smuggling venture because of our policy to turn the boats back, because of our policy to intercept vessels that are coming illegally into our waters and remove them from our waters. The former Prime Minister said:                 Mr Abbott is peddling a myth to the Australian people. _ he's trying not to be exposed as telling the Australian people something that can't and won't work.                 Well, it is working. The only myth was what was peddled by those opposite when they sat on these benches and when they said the boats could not be stopped.                 Finally, there is of course the Manager of Opposition Business, who, when he came to the job, said 'By the time we came to government we recognised it was not able to be done.' You know what? Where there is a will, there is a way. This government has the will and we have the way.

  I do accept that members opposite are supremely embarrassed about their record in government. That is what I accept.                     The record of members opposite, quite apart from the 55,000 illegal arrivals by boat, was 200,000 more unemployed people and debt skyrocketing towards $667 billion. We were elected to fix this and fix this we will. We will fix it. We are marching to the rescue of this nation from the wreckage that we inherited from members opposite.                     It suits them now -                    The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                     to pretend that it was the best government that this country has ever seen. But the fact is the record of members opposite is of 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat, 200,000 extra unemployed people and debt skyrocketing towards $667 billion. We will fix it.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. The biggest barrier to internet access in Australia is not technology but lack of income. It has been always thus. The Australian Bureau of Statistics only last week confirmed that households in the poorest income quintile, the lowest income quintile, were more than 10 times less likely to have access to the internet at home than those in the wealthiest quintile - that is to say, of the lowest income bracket, 41 per cent had no access to the internet; of the wealthiest, four per cent - so affordability is obviously absolutely vital. But what was the inevitable object of Labor's approach to broadband? Making internet access less affordable than ever.                     Now I know that in the fantasy land of the Labor Party economics is not a strong suit. But the reality is that, if you create a massively overcapitalised government monopoly - what is that going to do to prices? It is going to put them up; what else can it do? Thirty-two billion dollars additional investment is what we would see if we proceeded with Labor's program. And, according to the strategic review, that would increase monthly broadband prices by 50 per cent to 80 per cent per month. The people on the Labor benches are mocking and scoffing; they do not care about the battlers they claim to represent.                   The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     They do not care about the people who cannot afford the internet today. Their goal, their objective, is to make the internet access that is unaffordable today to 41 per cent of people in the lowest income group even less affordable in the years to come. They are sticking with that policy. It is a policy the victims of which are the Australians they claim to represent and which they have so manifestly - on this and on so many other issues - and utterly abandoned.                 This Labor policy would result in average broadband monthly prices increasing by $43 a month, making it even less affordable. So our policy is designed to have this project completed sooner, cheaper and more affordably. That will make it more affordable, and a key part of that is the fibre-to-the-node technology which we will be deploying shortly on the Central Coast at Umina. Australians then will see how a competent government will deliver broadband.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can inform him that Qantas will still be subject to the Air Navigation Act. The Air Navigation Act provides that to be a designated national carrier an airline has to be 51 per cent Australian owned; the chairperson has to be Australian; the majority of the board has to be Australian; and the principal base of operations has to be Australia.                 The point I want to make in addition, though, is that by continuing to want to have Qantas shackled by part 3 of the sale act, what the Leader of the Opposition is effectively doing is giving Virgin a better deal than Qantas. I am all in favour of Virgin. I think it is a fine airline, but why should Virgin be given an advantage in running its business that Qantas does not? As long as the Leader of the Opposition persists in his opposition to what the government is proposing, he is giving Virgin a better deal than Qantas.                     Why would any Australian want to see the big flying kangaroo disadvantaged? As long as the Leader of the Opposition persists in his current position - and we know he does change his mind quite often - he is giving Virgin a better deal than Qantas and that is just not right.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. I appreciate that the member for Banks has lots of Qantas staff living in his electorate and he wants to give them every chance to keep their jobs and to be a continuing part of one of the world's great airlines. Qantas is one of the world's great airlines, and this government wants to see Qantas continue as one of the world's great airlines, and the best way to ensure this happens is to take the shackles away. That is why the first thing that the government is going to do for Qantas is to repeal part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act, which puts a whole lot of restrictions on Qantas which do not apply to Virgin. What this government wants to see is both big Australian airlines competing on the same playing field. The fair thing is to have both big Australian airlines competing on the same playing field. I have great faith in the staff and management of Qantas to compete. But we have got to take the shackles off. We have got to allow them to compete on the same playing field under the same conditions as their competitors, and that is what this government wants to do.                     The other thing we want to do is make it easier for all Australian airlines to compete, to employ and to expand. We want all Australian airlines to flourish, and to do that we are going to repeal the carbon tax. The carbon tax is a tax on Australian airlines which other countries simply do not face. All of Qantas and Virgin's competitors do not face the carbon tax, so we are going to take it away. The carbon tax is a $106-million hit on Qantas jobs; it is a $48-million hit on Virgin jobs; it is a $2Â½ million hit on Rex jobs; and it should be gone.                     Let me just remind members opposite that two decades ago under a Labor government this parliament sold Qantas. It was a gutsy call by the then Labor government, but that was a gutsy Labor government. It was a gutsy Labor Party in those days. What we now need to do, having sold Qantas, is to give it its freedom, and that is what this government proposes.

  To those who are frightened about what might happen, to those who are fearful of the future, to those who think that any change in the Qantas Sale Act is some kind of a disaster, I say: look at Virgin. Virgin is employing Australians. It is serving Australians. It is, in every meaningful respect, an Australian airline. Why does this Leader of the Opposition think that Virgin should be given a commercial, competitive advantage that is denied to Qantas?                      Why does the Leader of the Opposition think that Virgin should get a better deal than Qantas? I think that both Australian airlines should get the same fair deal. The people who work for Virgin are Australians; they are employed in Australia. The aircraft that Virgin flies are based in Australia; they are serviced in Australia. And what is good for Virgin is good for Qantas. Let's have the same rules governing both airlines.

  I thank the member for Mallee for the question. We have heard a lot in the last 12 hours or so from the Leader of the Opposition about the threats to Australian jobs once part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act has been repealed. If you believe the Leader of the Opposition, there would be thousands of jobs lost overseas. He refers to the board and the chairman, the cabin crew and the flight attendants, and even the head office being moved overseas. It just shows how little the Labor Party understands about aviation policy.                  The reality is that the Air Navigation Act ensures that Australian international airlines have to be majority Australian owned. Our air services agreements require that the boards of international airlines have to be majority Australian - two-thirds have to be Australians. The chairman has to be an Australian, the head office has to be in Australia, the operational base must be in Australia and of course they must be majority owned in this country.                      So the doomsday scenario that the opposition suggests is simply not going to happen. Even if Qantas were to be like Virgin and separate its domestic arm from its international operations, the Air Navigation Act, the Foreign Investment Review Board, the Corporations Act, the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations, the Fair Work Act and immigration regulations would all continue to apply.                 Honourable members may remember that Virgin, Rex and Skywest were all at some stage 100 per cent foreign owned, but I did not notice any foreign crew on board; I did not notice that they were importing food or in fact using foreign ground crew. The reality is that Virgin's head office is in Brisbane, their ground crews are in Australia, 75 per cent of their maintenance is done in Australia, their catering is done in Australia and their flight crews are Australian. Virgin employs about 9,500 people in its operations, and 9,000 of them are Australians.                     Qantas is this proud Australian icon. They are not going to move their head office to any other part of the world, no matter who owns them. Their proudest boast is that they are Australian. And we want to make sure that they remain a strong airline, that they can be free from the restrictions that they have at the present time and that there can be a level playing field for Qantas, our airline. The opposition can give them a chance to save Australian jobs and to build a strong airline by supporting the repeal of part 3.

  At that time, I was very pessimistic that the opposition would have sufficient vision and foresight and sufficient faith in Qantas to allow appropriate changes to the Qantas Sale Act. I had little hope that the opposition would put sufficient faith in the national interest to want to make Qantas succeed. Since that time Qantas's position has become even more -                      As I was saying, since that time, Qantas's position has become markedly worse. Its credit rating has been downgraded twice. Its losses continue to mount, and it is obvious that there needs to be reform to give Qantas the chance to be competitive in the future.                     That is why the government is putting forward this initiative now - to help create a level playing field for Qantas. I hope that the opposition will, this time, become sufficiently aware of the deteriorating situation of Qantas to actually -                      I do not need it to be tabled; I have my own copy. The reality is that over the time Qantas's position has gone from bad to worse, but, wow, the opposition's position has gone from bad to worse as well. Yesterday we said there was one thing that the Labor Party could do to help Qantas be profitable in the future, and that was to get rid of the carbon tax. Now there are two things that they can do: they can get rid of the carbon tax and they can support the repeal of part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act. That will make a difference and it is time that the opposition got on board and helped give Qantas a chance for the future.

He will be a great Premier of Tasmania should the electors of that great state give him the opportunity in a couple of weeks' time. He will be a great Premier of Tasmania if he gets the support of the people at the election, and he deserves the support of the people.                  As for the so-called supertrawler, the supertrawler is banned from Australian waters. It was the Manager of Opposition Business, formerly the relevant minister, who let the supertrawler in in the first place. He then thought better of it. It was banned with the support of members on this side of the House. It was banned; it will stay banned.

  That is an exceptionally good question. It means for his constituents that they have got a better chance at a job and a well-paid job. That is what removing restrictions on business does. It gives the opportunity to create jobs. That is why the coalition is proceeding with removing the restrictions on Qantas. We want Qantas to have growth. We want Qantas to create more jobs. That is what we are focused on. Once upon a time there was a Labor shadow minister for transport who said this:                  Labor is on the record as having an open mind on the relaxing of the 49 per cent foreign ownership cap on Qantas as we recognise that without significant capital investment the airline is putting at risk its future international and domestic competitiveness.                 That was a former Labor transport spokesman in 2002. But, in case that was a false press release, in 2004 we had this, under the headline 'ALP rethink on Qantas ownership':                 A Labor government would consider lifting the restrictions limiting foreign ownership of Qantas to 49 per cent in a significant shift in policy.                 What happened to Labor? For a more contemporary view, I went to the book. I went to the book - the member for McMahon. Don't worry: I didn't buy it, I got it from the library. I don't do retail; I'm half Arab. I can't even find it in a remainder bin. The member for McMahon, the now shadow Treasurer, said:                 Political parties have a choice: they can lead the debate on foreign investment, or they can follow it. Tony Abbott's Liberal Party has decided to follow it, and Labor must lead it.                 Where is Labor leading us? He goes on to say:                 All round, foreign investment is a good thing for Australia. There is an obligation for responsible Australian political parties to lead this debate _ Promoting foreign investment to promote growth would be a very Labor thing to do.                 You see, we do not know what Labor stands for. They have got a snollygoster as a leader, who doesn't have any consistent principles. Labor is actually going back to a pre-1992 position on Qantas. To the member for Gorton, I want you to know: Qantas is not owned by the government anymore. The Commonwealth Bank is not owned by the government anymore. If there is anything else he needs to know, ring a friend. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratory is not owned by the government. TAA isn't in the skies anymore. I say to the Labor Party: please be consistent, please be principled, please do the right thing by the Qantas workers.

  Only yesterday the Leader of the Opposition told us that he was for action not words. During the election campaign we heard that their action was going to be to terminate the carbon tax immediately. They were going to terminate it. They were not just going to talk about it; they were for action. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to be the action man he claims to be, today is the day. It is up before the Senate. You can have your troops, your senators, go into the Senate to support repeal of the carbon tax. But something tells me that it is not action man, it is not the terminator, it is all talk at the moment.                 When the member for Lyons, who is something of an action man - I think he had a 13Â½ per cent swing at the election; the largest two-party preferred swing in the country - asks about taking real action to protect firms in Tasmania, you can back his words. What do we know about Simplot? Simplot has a $1.1 million carbon tax bill. What did their managing director, Terry O'Brien, say not that long ago in talking about the carbon tax? The managing director of Simplot, talking about the carbon tax, said:                 Governments should not have to prop up private businesses, but they do have the capacity to make a mess of private business, and over the last few years we have seen legislation and regulation that has impacted us.                 But it is not just Simplot; across Tasmania we see Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical, Grange Resources and Bell Bay aluminium smelter and, when you go nationally, a $1.1 billion manufacturing hit. But it is not just $1.1 billion of manufacturing; on top of that, there is also electricity, off-road diesel, gas and refrigeration in the case of food manufacturing firms.                 These are the very costs which could be reduced if the Leader of the Opposition took the action to walk his senators into the Senate and repeal the carbon tax. There is a strike at the moment. He is the strike leader; he could be the strike breaker. Business more generally has a point here. The Business Council says:                 To reduce these costs, Labor should step aside and let the government repeal the carbon tax legislation.                 ACCI have said:                 Abolishing the carbon tax and mining tax and coming up with a pathway back to surplus will go a long way to restoring business confidence.                   The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     AMEC have said that 'the repeal of the carbon tax and mining tax will go a long way to recovering some of the lost competitiveness'. It goes on and on with business saying that they want the action of repealing the carbon tax. It is time to take your senators in and repeal the carbon tax.

  They asked for it; we thought about it; and we rejected it.                     They asked for it; we thought about it; and we rejected it.                     Let me, if I may, outline for the Leader of the Opposition's benefit what his position has done. His refusal to contemplate taking the shackles off Qantas means that Virgin is in a stronger position than Qantas. As I said, I am all in favour of doing the right thing by Virgin, but let's do the right thing by Qantas too. Let's do the right thing by Qantas too.

  I would like to thank the member for his question. In his area they were famous strawberry producers. In fact, as you go down the road, you go past Roys Road. Wyatt Roy - who remains the youngest member of this parliament and will be for decades - has asked this question but it should really be asked by the member for Blair, because Ipswich is in his electorate and this meatworks is the largest employer in his electorate.                  But, of course, he is not going to ask this question on behalf of the working families and the people of Ipswich. Oh, no, he is not going to ask this question on behalf of the working families of Ipswich, because he believes in the carbon tax. He believes that they should pay that $1.7 million. You believe they should pay that $1.7 million, don't you? They could actually use that $1.7 million to expand the production facilities. They could actually be employing more people in Ipswich. They could be helping out the people of Ipswich. But, oh, no; you believe that they should pay the tax because, apparently out there in the great vault of heaven, you are changing the climate. Well, congratulations; well done!                 But I am a bit worried because since the carbon tax has been in it is all supposed to be better and it is all supposed to be fixed -                      but it seems to be around about where you left it. This was the sort of insidious thing, the ridiculous economics, which the Labor Party had - it is the whole reason they are in opposition - but which also affected the people of Ipswich. It still affects the good working families of Ipswich because not only do they pay it in the processing sector but they also pay it on electricity, water and the trucks going in and out of Ipswich employing working men and women. They are going to pay it on that from 1 July. You believe this tax should be everywhere.                     You just sow it home, because the people of Ipswich can go to the member for Blair and say, 'He's not much of a member, but he is changing the climate, which is very good.' It is great to see that your belief -                      in this is greater than your belief in the working men and women of Ipswich, who you should be standing up for. This carbon tax is such a work of art because if less than 25,000 tonnes of carbon are emitted, they do not pay the carbon tax, but once a beast goes through on the hooks and they go over 25,000 tonnes they do. It is actually a $603,000 beast. You must have been on the working group to work that one out! So what we will do for the people of Ipswich - and thank you, Wyatt Roy, for asking the question - is help the working families and get rid of the carbon tax.

  Qantas asked us to consider a number of initiatives. We investigated them. We are going to free Qantas from the shackles of the Qantas Sale Act. We are not going to give them the debt guarantee that they sought because we do not believe in playing favourites between private companies. We believe in giving all private businesses the same fair deal -                      on the same level playing field, and, once upon a time, so did Labor members. But I am afraid this is a very shrunken Labor Party and a very shrunken Leader of the Opposition.                     I have concluded my answer.

  That is an outstanding question.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker, I had a hunch that the question was for me. I want to thank the member for Braddon for his question, and, yes, I have seen the article where there is a doubling of the number of small business customers really grappling with rising energy costs. I draw heavily from Sylvia Sayers, the Devonport Chamber of Commerce and Industry president. She makes the point that 'running a small business is getting more and more expensive' and that 'costs are increasing'. She goes on to say that when costs increase it just puts extra burden on the economy where, in the case of Tasmania, the economy is not that flash and where people are more careful with their expenditure.                 She goes on to talk about it being a 'double whammy'. The people in Tasmania know about the double whammy. They have had the double whammy of Labor-Green alliance governments in Tasmania, as they have had previously at a federal level. Madam Speaker, you would remember the carbon tax we were promised we would not have but that we did have. That was a creation of the Labor-Green alliance. What we need in Tasmania is a chance for Tasmanians, who are enterprising people, to have every opportunity to succeed. The abolition of the carbon tax is a really meaningful and constructive step in that direction.                 The Tasmanian Liberal opposition have pointed to a reduction in household electricity prices of 5.6 per cent, gas prices becoming more affordable, exporters having another price pressure taken off them so that they can create jobs, a reduction in freight costs and the costs of using the Bass Strait ferry and TasRail internally. The Tasmanian people know that if Labor has its way this tax will not only go up and become even more of a burden and create even greater pressure on those businesses but also that it will actually be extended to freight as well. So in addition to the extraordinary costs of cross-channel freight costs, we will have on-road freight costs going up as well, all adding to the pressure on the Tasmanian economy. It will be cheaper to travel on the Spirit of Tasmania if we get rid of the carbon tax. The flights in and out of the great southern island would be cheaper as well. But what can we do about that? What we can do is get the Labor opposition here to actually get rid of this tax. They do not like being reminded that under Labor 412,000 jobs were lost in small business. Did you know that is 1,320 jobs for every week of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government? But did you hear a word from Labor? No.                 Let me help the opposition: a small business job is a local job; a small business job is an Australian job. Perhaps the reason they were not interested in 412,000 small business jobs going is that maybe they were not union jobs and perhaps that was why they did not care. But for states like Tasmania to get rid of the double whammy of the Green-Labor alliance and the punishment and pain of the carbon tax, we need to get this Labor opposition off their backside to actually support the efforts of this government to remove this cost impost. The other thing they can do on 15 March is elect Will Hodgman and his team. We know about the natural system in Tasmania; we need the enterprise ecosystem supported, and you can do that by a change of government in Tasmania as well.

  A previous Labor Party that was a great reforming government in its own way was prepared to sell Qantas.                     A previous Labor transport spokesman, someone who was a lion of Labor, a person of great respect in this chamber, was prepared to change Labor's attitude towards the Qantas Sale Act, and I believe even now members opposite have it in them to rise to the challenge of reform. Now, I know that at the moment the Leader of the Opposition is good at complaining and hopeless at leading, he is good at criticising but he is hopeless at governing, but I think he is big enough to rise above this.                     What we are proposing to members opposite, and this is why I believe there is every chance that what we are proposing will pass the Senate, is to allow Qantas to operate under exactly the same rules that Virgin operates under. Let us look at Virgin. Virgin has gone from zero Australian employees to almost 10,000. That is not bad. Virgin has gone from nothing to being a great Australian airline. Virgin actually started off 100 per cent foreign owned. It is still majority foreign owned but Virgin employs Australians, it flies Australians and it services its planes in Australia. What is so bad about that, and why wouldn't a sensible Labor Party - a Labor Party animated by the same patriotism that the Hawke government was animated by, a Labor Party that spawned people like Martin Ferguson - a decent Labor man; a sensible Labor leader - wake up to itself and allow Qantas to do what Virgin does? To stop giving Virgin an unfair advantage vis-a-vis Qantas I want a level playing field. I want two great Australian airlines. I want Qantas to be able to compete. I want Virgin to be able to compete. I want them to be able to compete on the same level playing field, and if members opposite thought about it for five seconds, if they stopped playing these silly populist games, that is exactly what they would want.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question about higher education in Tasmania. I can report to him that since this government was elected we have approved $12 million in research grants to the University of Tasmania. We have approved $13 million for industrial transformation training centres. We have expanded the UTAS nursing school. We have expanded its Pathway to Success program and we have approved $26 million for the integrated marine observing system.                   The member for Griffith then left the chamber.                     So we have strongly supported the University of Tasmania because we believe that higher education is the kind of future sector that can strongly support a bustling, growing economy in Tasmania. By contrast, Labor imposed the $2,000 cap on tax deductibility for self-education expenses, hurting nurses and teachers and public servants and others in the process. We scrapped the cap because we saw that the opportunity for higher education is to transform people's lives and the economies in places like Tasmania.                  The coalition believe that higher education represents a very bright future for Tasmania, and if on 15 March a Hodgman-led Liberal Party are elected to government in Tasmania they will share that vision for supporting transformative industries like higher education in Tasmania for the future. It is certainly time for Tasmanians to understand that there is no future in another Labor-Green alliance at Salamanca Place in Hobart. There is no future to be found in Tasmania in the vision that Labor and the Greens have of thatch-roofed houses in cosy hamlets with a blueberry led recovery of the Tasmanian economy. That is what the Greens and Labor are offering: the blueberry-led recovery. We love blueberries - they are particularly good for you as an antioxidant - but I am not sure they will replace mining and forestry and higher education in Tasmania.                 So I say to the Tasmanian voters: if you want a bright future for Tasmania, vote for a party that is going to support a future economy that is real in that state. Universities can help lead that recovery, along with forestry and mining, and the future for Tasmania is not going to be found in a Greens-Labor alliance in thatched-roof houses with swirling smoke coming out of their chimneys in lovely hamlets like the shire out of The Lord of the Rings. Tasmanians need to vote for an economy that is real and that will create jobs. A Hodgman-led Liberal government will give it to them.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a bit ironic. Labor has absolutely no credibility when it comes to tourism - none whatsoever. What did they do when they had responsibility for tourism? They increased tourism taxes - a 45 per cent increase in the passenger charge. They introduced a carbon tax - $115 million, not much different to the $106 million that Qantas has had to incur under a Labor Party carbon tax. There was a 12 per cent reduction in profits because of the carbon tax to the tourism industry alone last year. They reduced funds for Tourism Australia. Our capacity to market effectively on international markets was reduced. The ability for Qantas to take advantage of international visitors was undermined by the Labor Party because they reduced the budget for Tourism Australia. They have also increased penalty rates, which has crippled so much of the tourism industry in Australia. Of the 412,000 jobs that were lost in small business, many have been in the tourism sector. Also they have strangled visa access -                      Absolutely correct, Madam Speaker. It is highly relevant to show to those opposite that their capacity to talk with any sense of credibility about tourism is impossible. The fact of the matter is: the coalition is looking to provide Qantas with freedom, remove the ownership shackles -                    The member for Bendigo then left the chamber.                     and scrap the carbon tax, because we want Qantas to survive in this country, to be able to take advantage of the tourism opportunities, which will be enormous in the next 30 years but only if we have viable airlines in Australia. Those opposite have shown that they are not interested in creating a market for tourism, much less looking after Qantas, which is one of the great tourism assets in this country. Those opposite need to understand: if locals want to capitalise on the tourism opportunities, we have to maintain the airline, the tourism asset, that is Qantas - that international brand name, that very successful brand name. If you do not move with us on these bills, scrapping the carbon tax and providing that the ownership shackles be removed from Qantas, then you are doing a disservice to tourism.

  I am looking at a document that I understand Qantas released last week, and it says: 'Since financial year '09, Qantas has faced an increasingly challenging environment. Yields are down; the fuel price is up.' And then it says: 'Domestic carbon tax unrecovered of $106 million in financial year 2012-13.' So Qantas know that one of the problems that they have got is a $106 million a year hit -

  I thank the member for Forrest for her question because it seems that the Leader of the Opposition still is a little unsure about the progress of Operation Sovereign Borders, which has meant that for the last 75 days there has not been a successful people-smuggling operation or venture to reach Australia.                 I say that because this morning he said, 'There is no doubt that the tempo of operations has put an additional strain on our border protection fleet.' I know he may think he was referring to an article in The Australian, but the article he probably should read in The Australian was this one from August 2012, which states, 'Asylum demands breaking Navy fleet as patrol boats crack up.' It reads:                 AUSTRALIA'S navy patrol boats are literally cracking up under the strain of intercepting the surge in asylum-seeker vessels _                 That was the history under the previous government when they ran the most extensive 24-hour water taxi service in the history of this country, as boat after boat - more than 800 - turned up on their watch. That was the history under the now Manager of Opposition Business and former minister. We used to have an average of 26 boats turning up every single month. When the member for Gorton was minister, we had an average of 37 boats turning up every month. For the last two months, there have been none that have turned up with a successful venture to Australia.                 I am asked about the impact. The impact of Operation Sovereign Borders and, in particular, our maritime operations has been devastating on people smugglers. People smugglers are having calls on them to hand the money back by the people who have ended up back in Indonesia. They are saying, 'We want the money back,' and the people smugglers are running and hiding. This is happening for one reason: our policies are no bluff. They are no threat; they are real. They happen. If boats seek to come illegally to Australia, then they are removed from our waters. That is what happens under our policies. We do not trumpet it; we do it, and in the doing you get the results. That is what you get.                 At the last election, those opposite took a bluff to the election. They took an absolute bluff to the election. What they had was an invisible 10,000-man camp on Manus Island, which the now Manager of Opposition Business used to boast about. There were detailed resettlement arrangements which looked like this: an absolutely blank sheet of paper. And I table the former government's detailed resettlement arrangements for people in Papua New Guinea. I table it. It is a blank sheet of paper. They left the hard work to this government to clean up the mess of more than 800 arrivals, a capacity at Manus Island which was under-resourced, with arrangements which were underdone and not thought through. This government knows that you do not bluff the boats away; you have policies which get the job done. And that is what we have got.

  I thank the member for O'Connor for his question because I know that his constituents were concerned about the many reports of wasted aid and untargeted aid under the former Labor government. Reports like 'Aussie millions wasted overseas' were of concern to his electorate and those of others.                 On coming to office, yes, the new government has had to clean up the mess of the Labor Party. We all know about the $47 billion of deficit this year, the $123 billion of accumulated deficits and the $667 billion of gross debt that we were heading towards had there not been a change of government. But we have also had to clean up the mess in the aid budget.                 You see, what Labor would do is that they would make an announcement about an increase in the aid budget, and then, having promised to increase it, they would strip the money out of the aid budget. In the last 15 months of the Labor government, they stripped away, after announcing it, $5.7 billion from the aid budget. So it was a mirage. They did not even have the courage to take it to an election. They would announce it then strip it away.                 In contrast, we said before the last election that we would make savings of $4.5 billion over the forward estimates and that we would stabilise the aid budget to $5 billion a year and thereafter it would increase by CPI. We also said we would focus the aid budget on our region, on the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific, and that we would alleviate poverty by promoting economic growth, sustainable growth.                 The Deputy Leader of the Opposition sought to justify the mess under Labor by saying in this House on 27 February:                 _ we looked at every dollar of aid spending to make sure that it was well targeted.                 Really? 'Well targeted'? By 'well targeted', does she mean the $375 million that was ripped out of the aid budget in 2012 and again in 2013 to put into the budget black hole caused by the blow-out in onshore detention centre costs?                 By doing that, by transferring the money from aid to immigration, the Labor government made itself the third-largest recipient of foreign aid - the Labor government!                     By 'well targeted' does she mean Bob Carr's pet projects as he meandered around the globe gathering material for his book? He promised millions of dollars for a rhinoceros program in Sumatra. That is a lovely project for the world wildlife foundation but not for the Australian aid budget. Or does she mean Bob Carr's millions of dollars for architectural preservation in Myanmar? That is fine for some UN organisation but not for the Australian aid budget. Or does she mean by 'well targeted' the millions and millions of dollars promised to Grenada to rebuild their parliament house? Grenada is a country in the Caribbean that is rated high on the Human Development Index, as opposed to countries in our region that are rated low.                     The Australian government has reprioritised the aid projects and we have stopped the waste.

  Does anyone seriously believe that, at a time like this, Qantas wants to pay $106 million in carbon tax? Here is a company which has just reported a $252 million loss for just a half-year, and this genius opposite thinks they want to keep paying $106 million in carbon tax.                     This idea that Qantas somehow loves the carbon tax, even though the carbon tax adds $106 million to its costs, even though the carbon tax is contributing to a $252 million half-yearly loss, is just crackers.                     It is just crackers, Madam Speaker. Tell them they're dreaming. That's what they're doing: they're dreaming.                   The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                     They're dreaming. We are going to give Qantas and Virgin the same level playing field to compete upon and we are going to get rid of the carbon tax on all of them. That will save Qantas $106 million a year. It will save Virgin $48 million a year. It will save Rex $2Â½ million a year. And they will be very, very grateful. Their jobs will be safer and their companies will be more secure.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Ryan for her question and I note her ongoing concern and interest in this matter. As she knows, last December our Prime Minister committed this government to delivering reform on overseas adoption, in collaboration with the states and territories. I can confirm that today, just three months after that announcement, that decision to act, the Prime Minister and Attorney-General Brandis have announced the commencement of new laws to streamline the process for Australian families adopting children through Taiwan and South Korea. As the member will know, approximately 40 per cent of overseas adoptions come from South Korea and Taiwan.                  These laws will significantly reduce the time frame to finalise adoptions. They will reduce that unnecessary stress on families, allowing them to focus on supporting their child to feel safe and secure in a new home. The legislative amendments will also affect adoptions from Ethiopia that have not yet been finalised in Australia. The decision to include Ethiopia is to assist the small number of families in Australia whose adoptions through the programs have not yet been finalised. The best interests of the child are at the heart of these laws. The Australian government is committed to ethical and responsible intercountry adoption practices consistent with Australia's international obligations. The laws are consistent with the need to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect children whilst providing this streamlined process for Australian families who wish to adopt.                 On behalf of the Prime Minister and the government, I also want to place on record our thanks to Deborra-Lee Furness, for her steadfast advocacy, and Helen McCabe, Catherine McDonnell and John O'Neill, who in fact joined the Prime Minister for the announcement today. Supporting families is a core value of the coalition, and I know that it is a core value of those opposite, so I look forward to the support across the chamber for these laws, in the interests of children being adopted and in the interests of the families who want to adopt these children so they can feel secure and loved in a new home in Australia.

  I thank the member for Gilmore very much for her question and her continued interest in getting good health services for the people of Nowra. I come today to heap praise on the former health minister, the member for Sydney. Minister Plibersek trumpeted the GP superclinic program as one of the greatest she ever presided over and one of the greatest programs that Labor ever conjured up. I have a couple of facts to start with. They promised $650 million of taxpayers' money. It was, of course, borrowed money because they had already spent all of the taxpayers' money that they had collected. They promised 64 superclinics but they delivered 27 during their time.                     Some of them that were promised in 2007 still have not started construction even.                     If you look at the one for Nowra, there is a great story to be told. This is where my praise must come in.                     I concede ground where necessary. This was a program that was promised, as I said, for 64. This one was promised in 2010.                      The great news for the former health minister is that we are now in 2014 and construction is almost ready to start. Well done!                     The threat of course is that patients will be turning up to a building site expecting to see a doctor but only see a carpenter or maybe a tiler.                     I say to people: 'Be patient, because some were promised back as far as 2007.' We want to see better health outcomes for Australians, but we are not going to do it Labor's way. We are not going to do it by promising to put money into clinics that were set up to run in competition with doctors who had already put their own money into constructing their clinics. You had people who were putting at risk their own capital, doctors who had worked hard to build the clinics, yet you had the Labor government coming along with borrowed money - $650 million - saying that they were going to set up a taxpayer funded clinic diagonally opposite the doctors' clinic. It made no sense. In fact, it detracted from the primary care model because young doctors coming through did not want to buy into those existing practices. Labor wasted money - billions and billions of dollars.                 We are coming up to the fourth anniversary of the Nowra clinic. It is just about to start construction. It should remain as a legacy of Labor's incompetence into all time.                 Leave not granted.

  Absolutely not. This is just a nasty smear from the Leader of the Opposition. I am aware that Qantas today put out a statement -                      Just so that members of this House should know what the situation is, Qantas has today put out a statement to say:                 We have said that the price on carbon is a cost to our business that we have not been able to recover through fare increases _                 So there we have it: the carbon tax is a drag on Qantas that it does not need. It is a $106 million hit on jobs at Qantas. We will get rid of the carbon tax, but the Leader of the Opposition wants to leave this $106 million a year hit on Qantas in place.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and I acknowledge the work he has done over the years to strengthen our economy, including his work at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The national accounts figures have been released. I can report to the House that in the December quarter GDP grew a little above the expected rate, at 0.8 per cent. In this quarter, household consumption is also up by 0.8 per cent and export volumes are up by a strong 2.4 per cent. As the Treasurer said earlier today, there are positive signs emerging in the economy. As well as these encouraging national accounts, total private building approvals increased strongly in January by 6.6 per cent, taking approvals to the highest level since 2002. The ANZ job advertisement series rose sharply in February, by 5.1 per cent, and the National Australia Bank Monthly Business Survey also showed a rise in confidence. It is now above the long-run average.                 There are lots of challenges, but this government has a plan that will make it easier for the people and the businesses of Australia to rise to them in the future. Our plan means getting taxes down, it means getting red and green tape down, it means getting productivity up and it means building the infrastructure that this country needs, because infrastructure, particularly roads, is the muscles and sinews of our economy. We will scrap the carbon tax, which this House should surely know by now is a $9 billion a year hit on jobs. We will scrap the mining tax, which is a brake on investment in this country. We will give businesses a $1 billion a year red and green tape cost reduction. I am so pleased to remind the House that, thanks to the good work of the Minister for the Environment, some $400 billion worth of new projects have been given environmental approval since last year's election.                 So this is a country which is open for business. This is a country which is well and truly under new management, and that should give the people and the businesses of our country much more confidence in the weeks and months ahead.

  Typically, it was more in the nature of a smear than a statement. But I can tell the Leader of the Opposition that there has been no contact whatsoever between me and my office and Qantas along the lines that the Leader of the Opposition suggests. Just for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, it is worth reminding him of what members opposite used to think when they were in government. We had a very interesting report in The Australian Financial Review by none other than Kevin Rudd's former chief of staff, who said:                 The ALP should remember the _ constraints the Act imposes on a company playing in an international services market.                     The former chief of staff to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd goes on in this morning's The AustralianFinancial Review:                 Remember is the operative word. The ALP had amendments to deal with this ready to legislate in 2009.                 So members opposite know that the Qantas Sale Act is a problem. They had amendments ready to go, and then they lost their nerve. But not only did the former chief of staff to the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, publish in TheAustralianFinancial Review this morning; he was also on Radio National this morning, and he said something very interesting: 'We had the then minister, Anthony Albanese' - that is the member for Grayndler, I believe - 'who prepared changes to the sale act.'                     There we are: the gentleman interjecting. He himself prepared changes to the Qantas Sale Act, so he knows in his heart that Qantas needs to be freed from these shackles. And the former chief of staff to the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, went on to say, 'We had the total support of the opposition,' and that is exactly right -                      because we have always thought that Qantas needed its freedom to compete. I do not want to see Qantas getting any special advantages. I just do not want Virgin to have the special advantage which it currently does because it is not constrained in the way that Qantas is. So please, Madam Speaker, let us have no more weak hypocrisy from this incompetent opposition.

  I thank the member for Tangney for the question and recognise that the December quarter national accounts released by the ABS today, as the Prime Minister said a little bit earlier, were slightly better than what appears to be the consensus forecast, but still the Australian economy growing at 2.8 per cent for the year is less than trend, which is around three to 3Â¼ per cent. But, significantly, it is not enough to start to reduce the level of unemployment. So we have to grow the economy faster to improve the speed of economic growth to start to drive down the level of unemployment in the economy.                 The best way to do that, the most immediate way to do that, is to remove the shackles on business. It is rare to happen, but a coordinated release by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and the Minerals Council of Australia came out today and said the Senate should support carbon tax repeal. Business is saying: 'You should support the repeal of the carbon tax.' That is one way that you can immediately lift the speed of Australia's economic growth: repeal the carbon tax imposed by the Labor Party, because it affects every area of business.                 Qantas have dominated discussions this week. Qantas have revealed that not only did the carbon tax hit them last year for $106 million that was unrecovered - that they could not claim back from passengers - but their bill is nearly $60 million just for the first six months of this year. In the case of Virgin Airlines, a smaller airline, the bill was nearly $50 million last year. And these are coming off the bottom line of a business that is losing money.                 So the best thing we can do, the most constructive thing we can do for the economy right now, is to have the Labor Party in the Senate change its mind and repeal the carbon tax. The same goes for the mining tax, and the same goes for the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Why would you want to stop putting in place an entity that is going to improve productivity on construction sites? Why would you want to do it? I will tell you why: because you owe more to the union leaders than you do to the workers. That is the only reason that I can see in relation to the Leader of the Opposition. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition, if he cares about the workers, if he does want to have more jobs, if he wants to lower the level of unemployment: get behind the productivity agenda and the legislative agenda of the coalition now.

  I know that members opposite are now embarrassed because they have had this revelation from deep within the heart of the Rudd government that the Rudd government, the former government, wanted to lift the restrictions on Qantas. Let me repeat for the benefit of members opposite. This is the former chief of staff to the former Prime Minister: 'We had the then minister' -                      If members opposite are now trying to say that they are prepared to get rid of the 25 per cent and 35 per cent restrictions, come on, come on across! Come on across. If you are prepared to get rid of -                      the 25 per cent and 35 per cent restrictions, please vote with us, because that is what the sale act does.                     We want to do what Labor planned to do. We want to do what Labor planned to do and we have it on the authority -                      of Kevin Rudd's former chief of staff that that is what Labor wanted to do. They were gutless then, and now that a government has been good enough to put it on the table they should support it.

  I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. There has certainly been a lot of talk over recent days about options for Qantas. But only the government's proposal to repeal part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act will give Qantas and the aviation industry the level playing field that it has asked for and is essential for its future prosperity. What we have heard from opposition repeatedly is talk about how any kind of increased level of foreign ownership will lead to lost Australian jobs. The honourable member for Hinkler's electorate is one of those that is benefiting now from the competition of having Virgin and Qantas flights servicing places like Bundaberg and Hervey Bay. The Virgin domestic arm is majority foreign-owned, and yet I have noticed that Bundaberg and Hervey Bay -                      I have not noticed any pilots or crew coming in from Abu Dhabi or Singapore or even Auckland. These are the jobs that have been created because Virgin flights are coming to Bundaberg and Hervey Bay; they are Australian jobs. When Qantas is able to have a degree of foreign ownership in its domestic arm, those jobs in Australia will still be Australian jobs. This is because it is not practical to run a domestic airline with staff who are flown in from other parts of the world. It would be against our laws. Of course, you could not be efficient and competitive unless you were actually employing Australian people.                 The reality is that these airlines that have had some foreign ownership have made an enormous contribution to Australian aviation. Remember what happened at the time of the Ansett collapse and Hazelton and Kendell were essentially grounded. Well it was a foreign investor, Lim Kim Hai, who came in from Singapore, created Rex and resurrected services to so many regional communities. It was a 100 per cent foreign owned airline. Now Rex employs 1,000 Australians, many in regional communities. Their flight crews, their pilots are all Australian. They are training pilots in Australia in their own academy. The reality is that some of these airlines with foreign shareholdings have an enormous commitment to Australia. They have been prepared to back this country. The Rex partners lost a lot of money getting their airline up and running. It has been to the benefit of this country. The reality is that we can invest. We can have a prosperous aviation industry in Australia. We just need to give it the liberty to be able to achieve the very best possible destiny for itself and for the Australian staff it employs.

  The proposal that the Australian government is putting before the parliament at the present time is a comprehensive response to level the playing field to enable airlines to compete fairly and squarely in this country. What the opposition was proposing at the time was part way towards that direction.                 I am interested now that the opposition is suggesting that they might still be prepared to go part-way to the proposal, part-way to achieving the best possible outcome. So my suggestion and advice to the opposition is that they come the whole way, that they agree to the repeal of part 3, as we are proposing, to give the airlines the opportunity to operate on a fair and even playing field. On top of that, I suggest that they vote with the government to get rid of the carbon tax so that Australian airlines are better able to compete, that their costs are lower and therefore they can provide more opportunities for Australian workers and more services to Australian commuters.                 Leave not granted.

  I do thank the member for Barker for his question and I appreciate his concern to ensure that businesses in South Australia are given a fair go. The truth is, the carbon tax is an anti South Australian tax. It is an anti Australian tax, but it is certainly an anti South Australian tax because the list of South Australian businesses that are going to be damaged, and are being damaged, by the carbon tax is a rollcall of South Australian blue chips. There is the Nyrsta smelter at Port Pirie which is being hit $7.4 million a year by the carbon tax. There is the Pelican Point Power Station, with a $28 million a year hit from the carbon tax. But it just gets worse. Adelaide Brighton Cement has a $62 million a year hit from the carbon tax. And there is Santos, perhaps South Australia's best-known company, a very important part of our economy, with a $76 million hit because of the carbon tax.                 The only people who want the carbon tax to stay are the Greens, and it is high time for the Labor Party to side with the people and not with the Greens and repeal this carbon tax. We have heard from the Treasurer already today the statement by Australia's four big business groups, the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Council, the Minerals Council and the Australian Industry Group, who say:                 Australia's carbon tax is one of the highest in the world and is making our key industries less competitive every day it stays in place.                 For small business especially, this has been a major burden that has reduced profitability, suppressed employment and added to already difficult conditions.                 The government knows this. Business knows this. The people know this. The Leader of the Opposition and the Greens seem to have wax in their ears on this, but I regret to say, Madam Speaker, the carbon tax has a friend in South Australia and that is Premier Weatherill. He seems to be happy to have the people of South Australia continue to pay $550 a household more than they should. In fact Premier Weatherill said last year that the carbon tax is a 'fact of life' that he was actually looking forward to. He said, 'I am looking forward to a carbon constrained future.'                 Well, I want South Australia to be unconstrained. I do not believe in unnecessary constraints on the South Australian economy. Let us have a low-taxing government here in Canberra and let us have a low-taxing government in Adelaide too.

  The best thing that we can do for Qantas, the best thing that we can do for workers all around Australia, is to get the fundamentals of our economy right - to get taxes down, to get regulation down, to get productivity up and to get the infrastructure that our country needs built as quickly as possible. That is what this government is seeking to do and we are being opposed at every point by members opposite.                 The Leader of the Opposition can stand up and complain but he cannot lead. He can stand up and criticise but we know that he could not govern. When there was a proposal -                      What the government is proposing is for the same set of rules and regulations to govern Qantas as govern Virgin. Virgin has gone from zero to almost 10,000 Australian employees. Virgin is carrying millions of Australians a week. That is what it is doing. Virgin is servicing planes in Australia. It is creating jobs in Australia. Virgin is growing and Qantas is shrinking and that is why we want Qantas to be under the same rules that Virgin is under. That is what we want. Isn't that the best thing we can do for Qantas?                 What the Leader of the Opposition wants us to do, effectively, is to bail out a private company. That is what he wants. He wants us to get out the chequebook and write a cheque, just as members opposite have done so often. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition what the former chief of staff to the former Prime Minister said:                 It's puzzling when a party claiming to be progressive wants to compound out-dated interventionism with a market distorting loan guarantee specific to Qantas. This is a step down the Argentine road.                 That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants us to do.                     I am not giving the Leader of the Opposition the answer that he wants, because decent Labor people know that the Leader of the Opposition is dead wrong. Let me continue with what the former chief of staff to the former Labor Prime Minister said:                  _ the Qantas Sale Act should go _ and the ALP should not stand in the way.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for this question. I know that he is very concerned about student outcomes and our student-first policy. I do regret to inform the House that South Australia has recorded the worst results in school outcomes of any mainland state or territory. In fact, the Programme for International Student Assessment analysis that was released yesterday shows that, in the time that the South Australian Labor government has been in power since 2002, South Australia's results have declined considerably. In maths, South Australia's raw score for maths dropped 46 points, more than double the national average decline of 20 points. In reading, the state's reading score declined 37 points, again more than double the national average drop of 16 points. In science, South Australia's raw score dropped 19 points, 280 per cent greater than the average decline in performance across Australia.                 Unfortunately, the South Australian results have declined dramatically in the period that Jay Weatherill has been education minister and then Premier of South Australia. Labor's response is: 'There's nothing to see here. Everyone move on. Nothing needs to change. Everything's fine.' We have tried to put in place policies about independent public schooling, the national curriculum review, orthodox teaching methods like phonics and teacher training. The Labor state government in South Australia have opposed all of those policies. They are absolutely content to let South Australian students slip under the ooze of mediocrity.                 I am also asked about jobs. The problem in South Australia is that Premier Weatherill is tied very closely to the teachers union in that state and he will not act on the student results to put students first. But he also made the extraordinary statement last week that the Australian Bureau of Statistics data showing 45 per cent youth unemployment in northern Adelaide were nonsense statistics and that in fact youth unemployment was tiny in northern Adelaide. He is not just out of his depth; he is five miles from the shore as the Premier of our state.                 The truth is: if you have bad results at school, you will not have good job prospects. South Australia deserves better. South Australia deserves a government on North Terrace that puts students first, not unions first. While Jay Weatherill remains in power in South Australia, the job prospects of young Australians will be under the burden of very bad outcomes, presided over by a dysfunctional department of education in my state.

  No, it is not a political game; it is a very serious issue.                     I will tell you - hello, you are still here. Seriously, please. In 1992, when Qantas was privatised after a merger with TAA, it was a very different airline to what it is today. In 2000, around that period, Qantas also wanted to have changes made to the Qantas Sale Act. At that time, Ansett was a full-service airline in competition with Qantas. In 2002, when the Labor Party first raised the issue of changing ownership, as a result of lobbying by Qantas - of course Ansett was not around -  Qantas had a massive market share in Australia.                     Listen, you might learn something. Listen!                     In 2007, there was an $11 billion bid for Qantas - an $11 billion assumed market cap of Qantas. In 2009, when I made those comments, the market cap of Qantas was $4.5 billion. Today it is $2.5 billion. In 2009, when I made those comments, Ansett had gone, Virgin was not a full-service airline and Qantas had a much bigger proportion of traffic into and out off Australia than it does today. Qantas today, compared to Qantas in 2009, is a very different airline, in a very different aviation industry. Labor does not get it. The only difference is, Labor is going back to 1992 -                      We are moving with the times and recognising today that Qantas is facing immediate challenges from a full-service operator in the domestic market.                     It is also facing an enormous amount of competition from offshore which has helped Qantas to lose a massive amount of their global market share. The fundamental point is: what about the future? And the future is about getting rid of the Qantas Sale Act 2002, getting rid of the carbon tax and letting Qantas compete on a level playing field with every other airline that is now taking market share from Qantas.                     Madam Speaker, I seek leave to table the transcript of a doorstop interview with the now Treasurer, the then shadow Treasurer, from 1 pm, Tuesday, 16 December 2009.

  I thank the member for Boothby for that question - a long-time supporter of the Darlington interchange project. He took it to the 2007 election as a commitment and then to the 2013 election and fought for it. He convinced the infrastructure Prime Minister that it is a priority and he had a substantial swing to him. I congratulate him on that.                     It is an important piece of infrastructure, so important that in November 2008 the then member for infrastructure, the member for Grayndler, announced that he thought we should go ahead with it.                   The member for Adelaide then left the chamber.                     In fact, in 2009, the member for Grayndler, the then minister for infrastructure, said that he would award a $6 million contract for a planning study for it and he did. He said:                 At the completion of this study, we will know exactly what is possible and what the preferred scheme is. The project will be then ready to go to tender.                 It never went to tender.                      In fact, it still does not have a plan. In 2013, when we came to government, the infrastructure Prime Minister said, 'We want to get on with South Road and build a north-south corridor.'                     The infrastructure Prime Minister was convinced by Steven Marshall, the leader of the Liberal Party in South Australia, that we should do the whole corridor in a decade. We looked in the cupboard, we looked for the study the former minister had paid for and it was not there. There was no plan. So we funded a plan and we asked for it to be done by the end of February. In the meantime, there have been several cost estimates. Today, we still do not know what the cost estimate is for this project. In 2008, when the then minister announced it, it was $750 million. Then in August 2013, the minister in the South Australian government, Minister Koutsantonis, the next leader of the Labor Party, said the project would be a billion dollars. In fact, standing next to the member for Grayndler in the election campaign, Minister Koutsantonis said it was $1.8 billion.                 On 21 January, in Labor's jobs plan, the Premier of South Australia said it was $600 million. Then in February this year Premier Jay Weatherill said it was $830 million. Then last week, Tom Koutsantonis said it was $600 million. So they do not know and this is the problem. Last night, Jay Weatherill, adopting the Mark Latham tactics to debates, attacked again the infrastructure Prime Minister, rather than talking to the infrastructure Prime Minister as Steven Marshall is doing.                      If South Australians elect Steven Marshall next weekend, they will get a north-south corridor in a decade in conjunction with the infrastructure Prime Minister.

  We want Qantas to operate under the same rules that Virgin does. Virgin employs almost 10,000 people here in Australia. Virgin is flying millions of Australians around Australia every week. Virgin is servicing planes in Australia. If you want to operate an airline in Australia, you have got to have staff in Australia. If you want to operate an airline in Australia, you have got to have planes serviced in Australia.                     The problem with this Leader of the Opposition is that not only is he verballing the Deputy Prime Minister, not only is he defaming Qantas, not only is he running down Virgin -                      I said this is a man who is running down Virgin and he is. He is running down Virgin, talking down Qantas and, frankly, it is conduct unbecoming of an alternative -                      I am doing my best to understand the position of members opposite. What members opposite seem to be saying is that -                      we, the then opposition, the coalition, should have supported a proposal to remove the 25 per cent and 35 per cent restrictions in 2009. That I think is the position of the Labor Party that we should have supported in 2009. Well, let me put this to members opposite: if we were wrong then, they are wrong now. That is the absolute logic of their position. If members opposite believe that the 25 per cent and 35 per cent rules should go, well, support the government. Let us get rid of the Qantas Sale Act because the 25 per cent and 35 per cent rules are the very heart of the Qantas Sale Act that we want to repeal.                 I am all in favour of Qantas surviving and flourishing. I just want it to operate under the same rules that Virgin does. I beg of members opposite, who I think are genuinely concerned for jobs: do not discriminate against Qantas by continuing to subject Qantas to the rules that Virgin does not have to run under. If it is right for Virgin, it is right for Qantas. That is what this government wants the parliament to support.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I am sure the federal member for Braddon would agree, as would the Prime Minister, that, if there is a Liberal candidate for the state seat of Braddon in the upcoming Tasmanian elections, the former Senator Guy Barnett would make an excellent member for Braddon in the Tasmanian parliament.                 The member for Braddon will know that the government's strong border protection policies are designed to do three things in particular: firstly, to stop the deaths that were occurring at sea; secondly, to restore access to the offshore refugee program that was being denied by the previous government's failures - where more than 15,000 people missed out on permanent protection visas while waiting offshore because those visas went to people who came on a boat; and thirdly, to stop the cost.                 More than $11 billion in budget blowouts occurred under the previous government's failures. One of the most significant of those was the massive expansion in the onshore detention network which occurred as a result of their border failures. You could say that it was a 'building the detention centre revolution' that the previous government was running. They turned it into their own economic stimulus program all around the country which even extended to Tasmania.                 In relation to these issues we are having success. I can inform the House today that it is 76 days since there has been a successful people smuggling venture to Australia. I can inform the House that there are an additional 4,000, at minimum, extra places in the special humanitarian program, which was ground down under the previous government because they gave those visas to people who came on boats.                 I can inform the House, as I announced earlier this year, that this government has already closed four immigration detention centres at Pontville, at Port Augusta, at Scherger and at Leonora, which represents savings of $88 million every single year. And there will be more closures of these centres because that is the dividend of stronger border protection policies. But I am disappointed to say that there are some parties in this country, particularly in the Tasmanian state election, that want to reopen detention centres. In particular the Greens in Tasmania are saying - after going against detention centres for all their political lives - that they want to reopen the Pontville detention centre.                 In addition to that, the Labor candidate for Denison is also saying that she wants the Pontville detention centre to reopen and wants to send women and children there. It was the policy of the former immigration minister, now the Manager of Opposition Business, to get women and children out of that centre. So I am unclear about what the policy of the Labor Party is. What I do know is that when I say 'offshore processing' I do not mean Tasmania, and we will not be reopening the centre in Pontville.

  Maybe the opposition has not quite figured it out, but Qantas is still 60 per cent Australian owned and, yet, unfortunately, it has had to announce that 5,000 people will no longer be required to operate its services within Australia. So here it is, a majority Australian owned airline announcing 5,000 redundancies. The reality is, whether an airline is foreign owned or Australian owned, it is going to require a large number of employees to operate its services and provide its facilities in this country. It is not practical to fly those people in and out every day so that they can run a service from Melbourne to Adelaide. Whether the airline is 100 per cent owned by Australians or 100 per cent owned by people from other parts of the world, they are still going to need Australian jobs to provide these kinds of services. Frankly, my assessment would be that a foreign owned airline would require the same number of people to run a service in Australia as an Australia owned airline would.                 I hope that in the future Qantas will continue to grow and expand and provide more services across this nation. If it does, then it is going to employ more Australians. If we pass the legislation that is currently before the parliament, that will give Qantas the best possible opportunity to grow and expand its services and to provide more Australian jobs, more opportunities for young Australians to work in the industry and more opportunities for Australia to enjoy the quality services that Qantas provides at the present time.                 Virgin provides jobs, even though Virgin is part foreign owned. Qantas provides jobs. It has some level of foreign ownership. Rex provides jobs in this country, even though it has a high level of foreign ownership. The ownership of the company does not in any way change the absolutely fundamental fact that to run air services in Australia you need to employ Australians - and many thousands of them.

  I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. I note his longstanding interest in foreign affairs and the concerns of Ukrainians in his electorate of Mitchell. I can inform the House that the situation in Ukraine remains highly charged and volatile. Overnight, the travel advisory of the Australian government was updated to urge Australians who are considering travel to Ukraine or who are currently there to reconsider their need to travel or their need to remain in Ukraine, and in any event to register on the government's website Smartraveller.                 Given the volatile situation in Ukraine, my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and I announced today visa provisions to allow Ukrainian nationals in Australia temporary refuge from returning home while their nation is under threat. Ukrainian nationals who are currently in Australia on a visa due to expire and who may be affected by the unrest in the Ukraine will be able to approach the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and make an application to receive an extension of their visa for a temporary period. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her support for that change.                 We are concerned by reports that Russia has increased its military presence in Crimea. We reiterate our view that Russia's aggressive acts against Ukraine, an independent sovereign nation, are totally unacceptable. Australia joins with other nations across the globe in demanding that Russia take the lead in de-escalating the tensions, that it pull its troops back to base, and that it demonstrate its respect for Ukraine's sovereignty. In that regard, we welcome the visit to Ukraine by US Secretary of State, John Kerry, demonstrating solidarity for Ukraine and its people and their sovereignty.                 We are stressing the importance of dialogue and diplomacy. Australia has made its position clear in the now three debates that have been undertaken in the United Nations Security Council over recent days. In the meantime, I am in contact with the Australian ambassador in Moscow and with our head of mission in Warsaw, and we are working with heads of mission in the region generally, to register our concerns officially with the host governments and to ensure that we are providing consular support to any Australians who may be affected by this crisis.                 I note that Ukraine's charge d'affaires, who appeared before the joint standing committee today, acknowledged the strong stand that has been taken by our Prime Minister and by the government. We reaffirm our support for Ukraine and its people.

  As I think members all around this chamber would know, there has been a period of some difficulty in our relationship with Indonesia. I deeply regret that. I want to ensure members on both sides of this chamber that, as far as this government is concerned, we want the strongest possible relationship with Indonesia. We want the trusted partnership to be resumed at the earliest possible moment. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is in the closest possible contact with officials in Jakarta, and I am confident that the memorandum of understanding that the shadow member refers to will be signed as quickly as possible. Certainly there will not be delays on the part of this government.

  I thank the honourable member for her question and for her continuing interest and support for the government's policy on ensuring that all Australians have access to very fast broadband sooner, cheaper and more affordably.                  The previous government committed more than $20 million to a telehealth trial, but there was a catch. The only people eligible for the trial were those who had access to the NBN's fibre network - in other words, hardly anyone at all. No-one, in fact, in the honourable member's seat of McPherson was eligible - not one. There was no access at all to telehealth under Labor in the seat of McPherson. The Minister for Health and I recognised that this was an obvious shortcoming, and so the Department of Health has announced that telehealth services under the trial can be delivered by a range of broadband access services. It is technology agnostic. So, whether it is fibre or cable or copper or wireless, the important thing is to ensure that people get the service.                  There are some limitations to telehealth services. There are some conditions that are arguably incurable and inaccessible. Take Conrovianism. Conrovianism is a very pernicious problem. It has devastating symptoms.                     One of the symptoms of Conrovianism is a denial of reality and delusions of grandeur, and imagining oneself to be a movie character. The member for Isaacs, for example, does not know -                      The symptoms of this condition include loss of hearing, denial of reality, shouting abuse at unpredictable moments and lack of empathy for people on lower incomes - hence, those afflicted by Conrovianism don't care that they were going to put the cost of broadband up by 80 per cent, $43 a month.                    The member for Kingston then left the chamber.                     Madam Speaker, could I have the clock back a bit? We lost a bit of time then.                      Madam Speaker, it is very hard to be heard. Seriously, this syndrome is -                      There may be no cure for Conrovianism for those who suffer from it - as we have seen today - but one of the virtues of the coalition's broadband policy is that it will at least stop the spread of Conrovianism. We commit to stopping its spread and to ensuring that in the future broadband policy is governed competently and prudently.

  I can inform the shadow minister opposite that ministers who behave inappropriately will be punished. But no-one has done anything wrong in the case that this shadow minister is so preoccupied with. Not a single person has done anything wrong in this case - no-one; nothing. No-one has done anything wrong. Nothing wrong has been done.                   The member for Isaacs then left the chamber -                      Not only is there no fire; there is not even any smoke. Frankly, Labor should find a different tree to bark up.

  I thank the member for Lyons for his question. He is a person who has a great interest in seeing health services in his electorate improved. There are a couple of ways of approaching health. The Liberal way is to make sure that we put more into frontline services. We want to make sure that we can stop Labor's waste and get more money back to doctors and nurses to deliver the very, very important services that we will need not only today but also over coming decades.                 There is of course another way to approach the health portfolio, and that is the Labor way. The Labor way is to build great big new bureaucracies. When they were in government the former Minister for Health, Minister Plibersek, the member for Sydney, presided over the creation of 12 new bureaucracies which took money away from the people of Lyons and other electorates around the country. She took the health services away to pay for these new bureaucrats. It was a novel approach to health services, but it did not deliver better services. That is the problem. When you dig into the failed superclinics program, you see that Labor wasted hundreds of millions of dollars. They wasted a billion dollars in the failed e-health program. They put more money into bureaucracies and other areas that just did not afford services to frontline doctors and nurses who wanted to help patients.                 Let us take a look at the Sorrell GP superclinic. I notice that former minister Plibersek is taking notes on this. I have her former press releases if she wants them. The Sorrell GP superclinic was promised in September 2007. Let us look at the scenario for the member for Lyons of the expectant mother who looked at this press release from the former minister and said, 'This is great; there is a superclinic going into the electorate of Lyons. I might go and see a doctor at this new superclinic.' Of course, the baby would now be 3Â½ years old, but the Sorrell superclinic never opened. They have never seen a patient.                 There was $2Â½ million promised for the Sorrell superclinic. The federal government at the time, the Labor Party, screwed up this contract and they wasted $500,000 of taxpayers' money. It has never been built. It has never seen a patient, not in 2007 when it was promised; not in 2008; not in 2009; not even in 2010, when they promised this clinic again - twice over! It was good value for the Labor Party - $2Â½ million and you get two election promises out of it - but it was a bad deal for patients. It was a bad deal for mums who want to take their sick kids to see a doctor - because it was never delivered.                 Indeed, over half of the clinics promised under the failed superclinic model were never delivered. This was a shocking minister, not a super minister. The former minister failed the Australian people and she is failing the Australian people again in this portfolio.

  Of course the future of Qantas is absolutely vital, and that is why it is important that the parliament consider and deal with the bill that the government put before the parliament today to liberate Qantas from the shackles that it currently operates under. I say to members opposite: Labor was good enough to free Qantas from government ownership; now it has got to be good enough to liberate it from the restrictions under which it operates. Labor was good enough all those years ago to sell Qantas; now it has to be good enough to liberate Qantas. All the government is asking is for Qantas to get the same deal that Virgin gets. That is all we are asking. That is all we want. If it is good enough for Virgin, why isn't it good enough for Qantas too?                 Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that Virgin employs almost 10,000 Australians. It flies almost 20 million Australians every year. It operates some 140 planes here in Australia. It services planes in Australia. And you know, Madam Speaker, Virgin is growing. Why doesn't the Leader of the Opposition want to give the same deal to Qantas that he is prepared to accept for Virgin?                     I am here participating in a debate over Qantas. I have done little else in question time over the last five days. I say to the opposition: it is one thing to participate in a debate. What about participating in a rescue? That is what I ask. What about participating in a rescue by giving Qantas the same fair deal that Virgin enjoys?

  I thank the member for Moore for his question. While obviously there is a long way to go, there are significant positive signs. Yesterday the statistician showed that growth was slightly above market expectations. Confidence is up, export volumes are up strongly and housing starts are up strongly. The news today is that retail sales were up 1.2 per cent in January. That is a very strong result that gives us the strongest year-to-year retail figures in almost five years.                 But there is so much more to do and it is the task of government to get the fundamentals right. That means getting taxes down, getting red tape down, getting productivity up and building the infrastructure that our businesses need, because if we can do all that there will be more jobs and more prosperity for all Australians, including the people of Moore. It all starts with repealing the carbon tax, and it is worth reminding the House of what the leaders of the four biggest business groups in Australia said yesterday:                 Australia's carbon tax is one of the highest in the world.                 This is the important statement:                 It is making our key industries less competitive every day it stays in place.                 Every day it stays in place, it is making our key industries less competitive. They go on:                 For small business especially, this has been a major burden that has reduced profitability, suppressed employment and added to already difficult conditions.                 But it is not just about the carbon tax. It is also about trade. Our plan is about free trade, because trade means jobs and free trade means more jobs. I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Investment on successfully concluding negotiations for a free trade agreement with Korea. I welcome the statement yesterday from China's Premier Li that negotiations for a China-Australia free trade agreement will be accelerated - more good news on the trade front.                 But today the House of Representatives has taken a big step towards liberating Qantas from the shackles under which it operates, towards establishing a genuinely level playing field for Qantas, towards enabling Qantas to compete with its rivals on a fair basis. All this demonstrates that this is a government which is serious about supporting businesses and the workers of our country.

  I absolutely accept that Qantas has a fine safety record, perhaps the best safety record in the world. Obviously I am very grateful to the workers who are responsible for that. I am proud of them, as I am proud of Qantas. But Virgin is a safe airline as well. Is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting to this House that Qantas is safe and other airlines are not? What is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting here? Is he suggesting that the Qantas Sale Act is somehow responsible for Qantas's safety? Is that what the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting?                     The Leader of the Opposition is trying to suggest that it is the Qantas Sale Act that is responsible for the Qantas safety record. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to suggest that without the restrictions that exist under the Qantas Sale Act an airline cannot be safe. This is a most reckless and irresponsible suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition. Qantas is safe. I am proud of Qantas. I am proud of the workers. Virgin is safe. I am equally -                    The member for Melbourne Ports then left the chamber.                     In this country we are blessed with two outstanding airlines: Qantas and Virgin. They both have outstanding safety records - and Rex, also a great airline with a great safety record. The point I wish to make is that Qantas's safety record does not depend upon the Qantas Sale Act, and it is reckless of the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that it does.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. The reality is that the future of aviation in Australia is strong. This is a country that is well suited to aviation. It is a large country with our population concentrated in large urban areas. We have comparatively safe flying conditions and, obviously, as a nation an excellent safety record in aviation.                 Sydney-Melbourne, Sydney-Brisbane and Brisbane-Melbourne are all in the top 20 busiest routes in the world, so there is enormous potential for aviation to prosper in this country. But it does need to work in an environment which is supportive, which encourages investment and which gives the airlines the opportunity to provide the best possible services in the most economical way.                 Costs are high in Australia, and some of those costs are unavoidable but others are not. We do not need to have a carbon tax added to the cost of everything that we do. We do not need to have a mining tax, which in fact discourages mining investment and therefore limits the capacity of one of the biggest growth areas, particularly regional aviation fly in, fly out services. But we do have excellent regional air services, and most of those air services are conducted by companies which have a level of foreign ownership.                 Skywest was foreign owned by Singaporeans for a considerable period of time until it was taken over by Virgin. Virgin itself has a level of foreign ownership. Rex has a strong level of foreign ownership, and for that matter there is a 40 per cent ownership of Qantas. All of those airlines are operating with an excellent safety record and providing excellent services to Australians. They all employ thousands of Australians. They do not send their aircraft overseas for day-to-day servicing. They do not in fact bring people in from other parts of the world to operate these services.                  The reality is these airlines exist because they are providing services to regional Australia and our capital cities. They are Australian in the way in which they deliver services to the best possible standards. Many of them are globally award-winning airlines and they do it by being Australian and serving our country.                 What we must do now as a parliament is to give them the best possible opportunity to trade profitably in the future and the support to repeal part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act will be a substantial step in that direction.

  This question was asked yesterday and was answered very well, I thought, by the Treasurer. It was also asked the previous day, when I also provided an answer that I think was very pertinent to the issues that were raised. I would suggest that the best thing for the honourable member to do would be to read yesterday's Hansard and the Hansard from the daybefore - because the answers have not changed since then.                      As I thought the Treasurer said very well yesterday, circumstances have changed substantially over the last few years. We now have very strong regional airlines that have demonstrated that even with high levels of foreign ownership - in some instances 100 per cent foreign ownership - they are able to be competitive in this country and to provide safe and reliable services. Those services have continued through good times and bad. They have been able to respond to downturns in the economy and strong periods in a way that demonstrates the sort of flexibility that a company committed to Australia will inevitably display. There is actually only one airline that is operating in Australia with one hand tied behind its back. There is only one regional airline that has one hand tied behind its back, and that is QantasLink.                  We are offering the parliament the opportunity now to enable QantasLink to compete fairly and squarely with the other regional air carriers - just as we are inviting the parliament to enable Qantas to compete with Virgin and other carriers that operate in Australia. This is an opportunity to move forward and I think it is time that the Labor Party - following the decisive vote in the House of Representatives today - moved across to the Senate and allowed this legislation to pass the parliament so that Qantas can get on with building a strong future for itself.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question, which is fairly wide ranging. Can I just make it clear that there are a number of airlines operating in Australia and another of the airlines has access to international routes, and it is also an Australian airline.                     I hope that, by that interjection, the member for Kennedy is not intimating that Qantas is the only airline in Australia that is safe to fly, because that is simply not true. The reality is that what this debate about is ensuring the longevity of Qantas. We on this side are about keeping Qantas well into the future. We on this side want to make sure that Qantas is able to keep flying. We want to put Qantas on a level playing field with other Australian airlines - other Australian based airlines. Those on that side -                      Madam Speaker, what we need in this debate is for those who sit on that side - those in the Labor Party in the chamber opposite - to actually give Qantas a chance. Give the workers of Qantas a chance. Give them a future and get out of the way and let the Qantas Act be repealed.

  The member speaks as though Qantas do not have service undertaken overseas now. He would know as a former transport minister that a lot of their service activities occur overseas. As I said at this despatch box a couple of days ago, their new A380 fleet -                      You cannot reasonably expect an airline to set up a huge service facility to do major service on an A380 when you have only got 12 in your fleet and the first one, as I understand it, will require a major service for the first time in about 2020. The 747s are being phased out. You cannot keep a service facility in this country to service aircraft like that. So, in reality, Qantas are already having quite a bit of their service done overseas, including in Christchurch in New Zealand and at other places.                   The member for Parramatta then left the chamber -                      Perhaps a more serious part of the honourable member's question, however, is the issue of safety and the assurance that safety standards will be maintained at Qantas, especially during this transition period when a number of staff are going to leave Qantas's employ. I can inform the House that CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, has been in discussions with Qantas to talk about managing these kinds of issues and to put in place appropriate plans to guarantee that, even during this period of transition, Qantas will maintain its enviable reputation as a safe conveyor of passengers from point to point with its wonderful safety record. Both Qantas and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority are conscious of the need to address these issues, and I am sure that that is a clear and very important part of their plans into the future.

  I thank the member for Brisbane for her question. I note that the best thing we can do to give Qantas a leg up and to level the playing field for aviation in Australia is to remove part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act and ensure that Qantas can compete on a level playing field with international and other domestic airlines. This is hugely important. That is the starting point: a level playing field in legislation.                 As the Prime Minister said a little bit earlier, what else can we do? We can help to grow the economy - to lift the tide so that all boats will rise and all will benefit. The retail trade figures that came out today were three times better than what the market expected - three times better than what the market consensus was for January. The international trade figures that came out today were also significantly better than market expectations.                 I have noticed during the course of this question time that the Labor Party would never want to let the facts get in the way of an accusation. The claims by the Leader of the Opposition here about the safety record of Qantas are outrageous. It is outrageous behaviour for someone who aspires to lead the nation. To simply sit here and claim inaccurately that the only way a plane is safe in Australia is to have it serviced in Australia not only totally ignores the fact that Qantas already gets planes serviced overseas but also ignores the fact that airlines flying to Australia do not have their servicing done in Australia and other airlines in Australia, such as Virgin, do not necessarily have their maintenance done in Australia.                 Of course the hypocrisy of Labor knows no bounds. Here they are beating their chests about Qantas and yet on 31 May the tourism minister of South Australia said: 'The best way to get to Asia from Adelaide is with Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines or Malaysia Airlines. Support the airlines that are loyal to Adelaide.' There was no talk about Qantas. What about Qantas - the beating heart of the Labor Party? They shed tears every day for the Qantas workers and yet their Labor tourism minister in South Australia is saying: 'Don't fly Qantas; go Cathay, go Singapore, go Malaysia - do not fly Qantas.'                 The hypocrisy of the Labor Party is rich. They are interventionists. They are protectionists. They want to go back to 1990. They do not understand the implications of their words.

  The fundamental truth is that we want to liberate Qantas from the shackles on its operation. We want to ensure that Qantas and Virgin are both competing on the same level playing field. We have had a lot of questions on all sorts of points from members opposite.                     The fundamental point is this: we want to give Qantas a fair go and members opposite do not. That is all we want. We want to give Qantas the same fair go that other airlines have. The former minister for transport stood up and asked earlier today what has changed between now and 2009, when Labor wanted to remove the 25 per cent and 35 per cent rules. I will answer honestly.                     He has asked what has changed since 2009.                     Let me answer with complete candour. Members opposite have got worse, and members on this side have got better. That is the truth. We have improved our understanding. We have gone forward; they have gone backwards.                   The member for Grayndler then left the chamber.                     The once great Labor Party, which had the strength, the courage and the insight to sell Qantas back in the early 1990s, has gone backwards. That is the truth. This is a worse Labor Party. This is a Labor Party which has -                    The member for Charlton then left the chamber.                     turned its back on reform and turned its back on leadership. What we are seeing today is a Labor Party which has turned its back on Qantas, and we will never do that. That is why we support this act.

  I thank the member for Macquarie for her question and I know that she is constantly in touch with the 10,000 small businesses that operate in her electorate and acutely aware that they are facing increased energy bills because of the carbon tax. At a time when being competitive and efficient is so important for small business, they do not need this carbon tax to continue a day longer than today.                 It is not just the small businesses in the member for Macquarie's electorate. There are of course small businesses all over New South Wales and all over Australia who are paying higher electricity and gas bills because those who sit opposite us are being obstructionist in the removal of a carbon tax, which Australia has already voted on at the last election in support of the position that those on this side of the table took - that is, to remove the carbon tax.                  Along with small business, 1.2 million households in New South Wales are getting hit with this carbon tax every time they turn on their lights, every time they turn on their gas cookers and every time they heat hot water, yet those who sit opposite are quite happy, as the member for Macquarie has said, to allow the increase in electricity and gas bills not only in New South Wales but also right around Australia. They are quite happy to see the carbon tax continue and every Australian business get hit in the hip pocket because of the carbon tax and the higher electricity bills that go with it.                 This point was highlighted by AGL, who supply electricity to residents in Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle, in their submission to the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal. AGL noted that gas prices will be 5.6 per cent higher with a carbon tax than they otherwise would have been and that households would save money as a result of its removal. Those are AGL's words. What we want the Labor Party to do is realise that they are hurting big business, small business and households by this belligerent behaviour of opposing the removal of the carbon tax.                 We have already seen the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry say:                 Acting now to repeal the carbon tax would boost business confidence and should be part of a broader national push to reduce high energy costs.                 Those who sit opposite are in favour of higher energy costs for small business and higher energy costs for households, and they should stop and think of others.

  It is a good question and it is tragic. It is absolutely tragic for any worker to get the news that his or her job is redundant. There is no doubt about that. It is absolutely tragic. There are two things that governments can do for workers in a situation like that. First of all, we can ensure that there are strong and effective employment services that can help people in those very difficult circumstances, and I am confident that we do have strong and effective employment services to help. The second thing we can do is try to ensure that the economy is strong so that if one job stops another job can start, and that is what we are determined to do by cutting taxes, reducing red tape, boosting productivity and improving our infrastructure. That is the best thing that we can do.                 The other thing that we should try to do is ensure that -                      the business that is shedding staff is able to restructure so that it can become competitive and once more have a strong future, and, in Qantas's case, continue to be one of the world's great airlines. That is what we are determined to do - to ensure that Qantas will remain one of the world's great airlines. The Leader of the Opposition constantly bickers across the table. He is bickering across the table now: 'Qantas won't be Australian.' Is the Leader of the Opposition seriously suggesting that a company like Virgin is somehow un-Australian? Is that what he is really saying - that Virgin is somehow un-Australian, even though it employs almost 10,000 Australians, flies more than 20 million Australians around the country every year -                      and services some 140 planes, nearly all in this country? I want Qantas to have a strong future. That is why I am prepared to establish a level playing field for Qantas. The Labor Party, back in 2009, wanted to create a level playing field for Qantas but lost its nerve.                     This government will not lose its nerve on this subject. We will ensure not just that Qantas is sold but that Qantas is finally free. That is what we want.

  Thank you very much to the most productive member for Dawson in many years. And he is not just that.                     He represents the sugar capital of Australia and he is a great supporter of the sugar industry himself. But I have bad news for the member for Dawson. We heard during the election campaign, from none other than the former Prime Minister Mr Rudd, that the carbon tax had been terminated. It has not. Only today, we have more news from the Senate. The Senate continues the strike from Labor senators. Three months and four days since the carbon tax bills were introduced in the Senate - no decision, no outcome. It is work to rule. The Leader of the Opposition has brought his union tradition into this House and into the Senate and he has his boys and girls on strike in the Senate. We would say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you are serious about being productive, if you are serious about cost of living and if you are serious about the impact on manufacturing and other Australian firms, bring your senators back to work and get them to vote on repealing the carbon tax.                 What it means for Mackay Sugar and Wilmar Sugar is a $1.9 million hit on their businesses, their workers and their consumers each year, whether that is at the Mackay plant or the Yarraville plant. But it is part of a broader problem, a bigger problem, of a $1.1 billion hit on Australian manufacturing. That is on chemicals, that is on cement, that is on food and that is on glass - all of these great Australian firms. That is why, when you look at the roll call of Australian industry, they are saying it is time for the Senate to vote. We heard from the Australian Industry Group in the last week:                 Australia's carbon tax is one of the highest in the world. It is making our key industries less competitive every day _                 We have heard from the Australian Forest Products Association:                 We ask that the Senate promptly passes the Bills to remove the carbon tax, as it is in our national interest _                 The Australian Aluminium Council said:                 It is clearly the Government's intention - and a position that the Australian Aluminium Council (AAC) supports - that this legislation be passed _                 The cement industry supports the carbon tax repeal legislation. The Minerals Council says it is necessary because it is a 'poorly designed response' to climate change. The Food and Grocery Council urges the Senate to:                 _ pass the carbon tax repeal bill without delay.                     There is a reason that all of these firms and all of these industries want the Senate to vote on the carbon tax repeal, and that is that it is affecting jobs, it is affecting costs and it is affecting competitiveness. It is within the gift of the Leader of the Opposition to bring his senators back to work. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: get out of the way and repeal the carbon tax.

  I am not quite sure what the deputy leader is actually talking about. We are repealing the whole of part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act. The Air Navigation Act is a separate act of parliament. There are some minor modifications to be made to that because currently it excludes Qantas in certain areas, and those modifications will occur. However, the criteria for designating a national carrier are determined by the government. There are a series of issues. They require two-thirds of the board of directors to be Australian, the chairman to be Australian and the head office to be in Australia, and require majority Australian ownership. Those criteria will remain in place. I made it clear in my second reading speech that we have no plans to change the designation rules for Australian airlines.

  Madam Speaker, I can assure you I will not be using any props, but I will be tabling a document from TheDaily Telegraph:'From HSU to prison stew' -                      at the end of my answer. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for pointing it out to the House.                 This week we were starkly reminded of why we need a registered organisations commission. The Daily Telegraph's front page story of Tuesday, 'From HSU to prison stew', about the former federal president of the Labor Party Michael Williamson's spectacular fall from grace reminded us all of why we needed a registered organisations commission. The government's response to the horrific stories out of the HSU, to the ripping off of workers by dodgy union officials, was to bring forward a registered organisations commission, amongst other things like a royal commission and the Australian Building and Construction Commission.                 The Leader of the Opposition's response has been to reject that. His response was to reach inside his pocket for his trusty union membership card that he apparently brings into the parliament every day and, like a lucky rabbit's foot, a little talisman, to give it a rub and to realise that his job was to jump to the tune of the union leadership. And that is what he did. On this occasion, the Geppetto to the Leader of the Opposition's Pinocchio is Tony Sheldon from the Transport Workers Union on Qantas - the little puppet, the Leader of the Opposition, was doing the bidding of, this time, Tony Sheldon from the TWU.                 But I have found some more examples of links between the Labor leadership and the union movement. They are not hard to find. Imagine my surprise, when I was searching the Leader of the Opposition's website, billshorten.com.au, to discover that the registrant of the website is the Australian Workers Union! So the Australian Workers Union does not even allow poor Pinocchio to have his own website. Geppetto makes sure that they keep a close watch on the Leader of the Opposition by being the registrant of his website, billshorten.com.au. If it is wrong you can correct the record, but it says 'the Australian Workers Union'. They do not even let him run his own website.                 What we would like to see the Leader of the Opposition do is to reverse his position - to put the worker first, not the union leader first. He can do it on Qantas. He can do it on the Registered Organisations Commission. He can do it on the Australian Building and Construction Commission. He can do it on the royal commission. He can pay back the $267,000 of HSU members' money that the former member for Dobell used to get elected in 2007. I table the front page of The Daily Telegraph, 'HSU to prison stew'. I am tabling that, but I do not think that I will table the registrant because he can get that himself.

  We have got plenty of debating points from the Leader of the Opposition, but what the people of Australia want and what the workers of Qantas want is a real plan to give their airline a strong future, to ensure that Qantas remains one of the world's great airlines. There are two elements to our plan. The first is to repeal part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act, which will give Qantas exactly the same conditions that their principal rival, Virgin, faces. The other element of our plan - plan B, if you like - is to repeal the carbon tax. That is our plan B. Plan A is to repeal part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act; plan B is to repeal the carbon tax, because the carbon tax has been a $106 million hit on jobs at Qantas in the last financial year and it has been a $58 million hit on jobs at Qantas in the current half year. That is the truth.                 So members opposite - and I accept that they want, in their own way, to help the workers of Qantas - want to help the workers of Qantas, but they oppose the means of helping them. They will the end, but they do not permit the means. That is the problem, because the only way to help Qantas right now is to get rid of the shackles that are holding it back, and that means repealing the sale act and repealing the carbon tax. That is the very best thing that the Leader of the Opposition could do for the workers of Qantas right now. I say: let us help Qantas. And I say to the Leader of the Opposition: just have the position today that you wanted to have in 2009 when you wanted to remove the 25 per cent and 35 per cent restrictions on Qantas but lost your nerve. Well, this government will not lose its nerve, and this government will never, never turn its back on Qantas. We will do what is necessary to ensure that Qantas continues to be one of the world's great airlines.

  I thank the member for his question. He is a great champion of rural health services. And it is great to see John Anderson up in the gallery today; he did a lot for rural health services around the country. This government is intent on making sure that we can get money back to front-line services. Labor left an incredible mess for us - accumulated deficits of $123 billion; $667 billion of debt - and they spent money like it was going out of fashion in the health portfolio on all sorts of crazy schemes and new bureaucracies. There were lots of funds spent that just did not go to front-line services.                 When you scratch below the surface of the GP superclinics scheme - because on the surface I think it looks okay; it has a good title; it looks okay - you do not have to scratch too much before you see that it is a nasty program. The GP Super Clinics Program has a nasty undertone. You do not have to poke too much into the GP Super Clinics Program to see a really nasty undertone to it.                 Who could have presided over that program? You have guessed it. It is our friend who is quickly engaging in conversation with the member for GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch. They obviously collaborated well before, as well, when they were in government, to come up with equally disastrous programs. But what we know about the GP Super Clinics Program is that the program was $650 million of borrowed money - wasted money.                 If you have a look at Western Australia, my good friend points out one example, but I asked my office to go and have a look at what the situation is with the GP superclinics promised by Labor in Western Australia, bearing in mind that this was taxpayers' money borrowed to go out and set up clinics in competition with existing doctors' clinics. Lo and behold, where they have been set up, the doctors have been poached from the existing clinics to go and work in the superclinics, to no better health outcomes.                 But, if you look at Western Australia in detail, Labor promised six GP superclinics. Some they promised twice. I will go through them. In 2007, they promised Wanneroo. In 2010, they promised Wanneroo. It is still not built. In 2010, they promised Rockingham. It is still not built, here in 2014. Northam was promised in 2010 - not built. Midland was promised in 2007 and again promised in 2010. It is open. Well done: one out of six. That is great. Not a bad achievement for the Labor Party. Let us go to Karratha. In 2010 it was promised. It is not open. And it is the same in Cockburn: promised in 2007, promised in 2010 and not delivered.                 We will clean up the mess that Labor left behind in health. We will get more money back to front-line services. We will rebuild general practice, not attack the doctors like Labor did. We will rebuild the health system for the 21st century.

  I have had a number of discussions with Western Australian ministers about the infrastructure program in Western Australia over the last few months. It will be a very exciting program. It will offer substantial additional road and rail investment in the state of Western Australia. We believe that it is important to have a strong and effective program that will actually deliver the kind of infrastructure that supports the enormous potential development in that state.                 We have indicated quite clearly that our priorities are to ensure that the freight systems of our nation are working well and that our particular responsibility as the federal government is to look after the interstate road and rail networks. We will be investing $35.5 billion in the next program in that network. That is the biggest program in our nation's history.                 The fact that we are intending to commit such funds to the road and freight rail network means that the states will have more access to funds to take care of their responsibilities, which are especially related to passenger rail services. The people of Perth can expect their state government to be able to invest more on passenger rail because we will be carrying the heavy load in relation to building the road and freight network that Western Australians need.                 What we have is a commitment to infrastructure across Australia. The infrastructure Prime Minister intends to deliver the biggest infrastructure program in our nation's history, and I am looking forward to the privilege of working with him to make sure it all happens.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his lifelong interest in deregulation and experience in small business - indeed, as Pakenham's leading draper. He is very committed to small business.                 There is a big difference between our approach to regulation and the Labor government's approach. Labor believes in its heart that government's job is to tell the people what was best. It believes government knows best. We believe that our role in government is to enable citizens and businesses to do their best, and that is why we are committed to removing $1 billion a year off the cost of regulation and red tape, and the first instalment will be presented in this House later this month.                 In my portfolio, media and telecommunications are heavily regulated, and we are already busy consulting with the industry. We have been doing that from the outset of the government, and tomorrow there will be a ministerial advisory council meeting with CEOs from the telecommunications sector and indeed from the media sector, the broadcasting sector, as well.                 But there are some very big differences. The first thing is that we are calling them together to seek their views, to get their input, to ask them. We are not calling them together the way the previous minister did, in a classic example of Conrovianism, bringing them together to tell them what he was going to do. A year ago, the representatives of the media sector came to this House -                      Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is good always to know that the member for Isaacs, again and again, reminds us that anyone can go to jail if they get the right lawyer. I had always assumed that the member for Isaacs was one of the neo-Conrovians. Neo-Conrovianism is a growing tendency in the Labor Party, trying to bring Conrovianism into the 21st century. But I can see now that he is an unreconstructed Conrovian at his heart.                 The second difference about the meeting tomorrow is this: the previous minister had said in New York in 2012 that he was so powerful that if he told telco executives they had to wear red underpants on their head before they saw him, they would have to do so. He said, 'I have unfettered power' - his words. There are timid souls, neo-Conrovians among them, who would say that we should just have a half measure: simply stop stipulating the colour of the underpants! We are prepared to stand up to vested interests in the undergarment industry.                     We are prepared to stand up to those who are interested in undergarments, who are professionally or, indeed, interested in any other sense. We will go full measure. We are absolutely determined to extirpate Conrovianism in all of its forms and there will be no shirking.

  Thank you very much. We have received the interim report. We have not received the final report.                      Oh, you have shot me in the heart! What a harrowing hit from Labor.                     We have had it now for about three weeks - that is about right. The Labor Party when they were in government held Gonski for 60 days - most of it against his will - and they held the Henry report for 130 days and then did not even implement it, apart from the mining tax. So I would say, please, we go through these things in a careful, methodical manner. We consider these things very carefully and, quite frankly, if the Labor Party paid the same attention to detail that we did, perhaps they would still be in government.

  I thank the member for Barton for his question, because I know that like me and members on this side of the House - and I hope those on the other side of the House - we have a very keen interest in ensuring that there is fair access to our refugee and Special Humanitarian Program. I know there are many people in Barton who feel the same, because he has brought these matters to my attention, and I know that he is pleased with the progress we are making with the Special Humanitarian Program, which I am keen to update the House upon.                 Our border protection policies deliver many things. The first of those of course is that they are saving lives at sea. I am pleased once again to update the House that it is 77 days today - 11 weeks - since there has been a successful people-smuggling venture to this country, and that is principally because of the front-line maritime operations being performed by our Navy and our Customs and Border Protection Service. Last Friday, the Prime Minister and I along with member for Solomon had the opportunity to thank those directly involved in those exercises. I know that those up in NORCOM now and those at Larrakeyah and other places who often through NORCOM will be seeing today's proceedings. They know that members of this House are deeply appreciative of the work that they are doing.                 The other thing this is achieving is ending the injustice where more than 15,000 people under the previous government's policies were denied places in our refugee and Special Humanitarian Program because the places under that program were given to those who had come on boats. Specifically within the Special Humanitarian Program, when we lost office in 2007-08 as a coalition, there were 4,706 places in that program. In their last year in office those who now sit opposite had 503 places. This year that program will once again have an additional 4,000 places in the Special Humanitarian Program.                  As part of our program, I have announced today that there will be a cap on the onshore applications at the current planning levels. This will enable us to meet the commitment of 11,000 places, a commitment that will go to people who have applied offshore. We have de-linked the program so that if you come by boat and you are sitting waiting here now, you will not get a permanent visa from this government. You will only get a temporary visa and those places that are preserved for offshore applicants will go to those applicants. There will be 11,000 including 1,000 for women at risk. That is what the dividend is of strong border protection. When you run your borders well and when you manage your borders well, then you can save lives at sea. You can ensure that our refugee and humanitarian program has integrity in that the places go to those who we decide will come here, not the people smugglers.

  Talking about trade training centres in schools, the former Labor government promised some 2,600 and it delivered less than 200. That is what happened. It made an enormous promise and it simply did not deliver them. I know that the former Labor government in the election campaign made a whole series of promises, including promises in this area. We made it very clear that we were not bound by them. It is as simple as that.

  I do thank the member for Bennelong for his question. He is a great supporter of good policy in trade and investment. Trade and investment with China is hugely important to Australia, but it cannot be taken for granted. In combination with South Korea and Japan, China makes up 51 per cent of all of our exports. Not only is China our largest customer for resources but it is our largest market for agricultural products, it is our largest market for foreign students, it is our largest market for tourists, it is our largest market for services and we have got a growing and very important source of foreign investment from China.                  But while China is our biggest two-way trading partner, that same thing can be said for 123 other countries. The competition is intense. The world is acutely aware of the opportunities presented by China. So we need to do all we can to lock in our trading assessment relationship if we are to protect and grow our access to China in the years and the decades ahead. That is why the comments yesterday by China's Premier Li, advising that China would seek to accelerate negotiations with Australia on a free trade agreement are most encouraging and highly welcome.                  Unfortunately, the eight-year negotiation stalled badly under the previous government - and I would suggest that the unwise comments from the member for Melbourne Ports give us a sense of why they failed. While Labor dithered, New Zealand got the jump on Australia and completed a free trade agreement four years ago. Since then New Zealand's sales of dairy products to China has increased by $2.2 billion. Over the same period, Australia's sales of dairy products to China have increased by less than $70 million. Clearly, New Zealand has comprehensively outgunned Australia. It shows that these agreements can make a huge difference.                 Just last week our senior negotiators met again in Beijing to advance our negotiations, and after eight long years of negotiation there is every reason to believe that an agreement could be reached this year. It confirms yet again that the coalition government is in part driven by strong trade policy, not a strong trade union focus.

  I thank the member for her question. I can assure the member for Perth that the Commission of Audit report will be released. It will be released when the government has properly considered it, and the government is in the course of properly considering it as we speak. I point out to the member for Perth that we have received but the interim report of the Commission of Audit. We expect to receive further reports from the Commission of Audit in the weeks ahead. But the job of government is not to bombard people with paper. It is to commission appropriate reports, appropriate investigations and appropriate studies, to consider them carefully and to release them at the appropriate time.

  I do thank the member for Robertson for her question and I do appreciate her interest in the fact that the Premier of New South Wales, I and the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development came together yesterday to announce that the missing link between the M2 at Pennant Hills and the expressway at Hornsby was finally going to be built. Construction will begin within 12 months at least, possibly by the end of this year, and within five years this long-overdue part of our national road system will be completed.                 This is good news for the member for Robertson. It is good news for the member for Dobell. It is good news for the member for Bradfield because his electorate will no longer be consumed by traffic. It is even good news for the member for Paterson because people will be able to drive from Newcastle to Melbourne without going through a single traffic light. And, yes, the long-suffering member for Berowra will also appreciate this good news, as will his constituents.                 This is a three-lanes-each-way road tunnel which will finally join up this important part of our national road system. It is a $3 billion project. There will be $405 million contributed by the Commonwealth, with the same amount from the state government. I want to say to the member for Grayndler that, yes, the money was committed under the former government. They talked about it; we are delivering it. They talked about it; we are building it. That is exactly what is happening.                 This new tunnel will cut out 21 sets of traffic lights. It will save the average motorist 15 minutes in travel, and it will take 5,000 trucks a day off Pennant Hills Road. It is good for families because less time spent in traffic jams means more time at home; it is good for business because less time spent in traffic jams means more time at work; it is good for the environment because less time spent in traffic jams means less pollution; and it is good for communities because no longer will these communities of northern Sydney be divided by the Pennant Hills Road traffic canyon. Traffic in a tunnel is not traffic which is choking local roads and local communities. But, above all else, it is good for our economy. We will unclog our economic arteries. That is what the roads of the 21st century are - they are clear arteries for a strong national economy. That is what we are doing - we are building a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.

  I thank the honourable member for the question. It is important to his constituents in Swan because 4,100 of his constituents work directly in the mining industry. Right across Western Australia, 68,000 work directly in the mining industry. It will be good for Western Australia, and what is good for Western Australia is good for Australia. We want to get rid of the mining tax. We want to get rid of the carbon tax. As the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, AMEC, said:                 The repeal -                  of the mining tax -                  will go a long way to restoring confidence and much-needed investment back into the mining industry.                 The Minerals Council of Australia said the repeal of the mining tax will:                 _ restore industry confidence, remove a further impost that destroys value in long-term, risky iron ore projects.                 One of the best things about repealing the mining tax and its spending is that it saves the budget $13 billion.                 Labor left us with $123 billion of deficits. They left us with debt approaching $667 billion. Abolishing the mining tax and its expenditure will improve the budget bottom line. As we know, we should laud the member for Lilley as the great genius who came up with a tax that raises no money! It is a new benchmark in tax incompetence. Not even the Greeks could come up with a tax that raises no money in the face of what they have had to come across. But do not believe me on that. Just over an hour ago Rio Tinto reported to the Australian Stock Exchange that in 2013 there were no mining tax payments included in the $3.157 billion of corporate income taxes paid to the Australian federal government. What a great tax! Rio Tinto paid over US$3 billion in taxes to the Australian government and not one dollar was the mining tax.                 What would be the response of the Leader of the Opposition? The Leader of the Opposition said, 'We have no problem with the mining tax in principle.' He is so opposed to the mining tax he is going to keep it, and now he says that it is a great principle to have a tax that raises no money. What a genius! The Leader of the Opposition has no policy platform, because he has no principles. There is no underlying guidance mechanism that can send him in a direction that improves the budget bottom line. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: get out of the way -                      Yes.

  We are carefully considering the Commission of Audit report - as, surely, all members of this parliament would expect us to. Of course it will be published once the government has carefully considered its recommendations. This is no great breach of precedent. We have had the interim report for less than a month. As I recall, the former government sat on the Gonski report for at least two months before it was released. My recollection is that the Henry tax review was considered by the former government for some four months before it was released. We will do justice to the Commission of Audit by carefully considering the report. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that we are hiding something from the voters of Western Australia. The one thing that the Leader of the Opposition is hiding is his true attitude towards the mining tax. The Leader of the Opposition went to Perth last week and was asked about the mining tax - and why shouldn't he be asked about the mining tax; let's face it, it is an anti Western Australian tax -                      In what was an absolutely brilliant interrogation by David Speers of Sky News the Leader of the Opposition was reduced to bubbling incoherence, saying that he really does not support the mining tax in Perth. But we know he supports the mining tax here in Canberra. This is a Leader of the Opposition who supports one thing in Perth and a different thing in Canberra. A Leader of the Opposition who decides what he supports depending on what city he is in is not fit to exercise leadership in this country.

  I thank the member for Indi for her question and I know, through my work in PNG, of the work that she has done through the organisation PNG Women in Agriculture over the last seven years. The member for Indi is correct: Australia does have an outstanding research arm in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade called the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. ACIAR is a jewel in the crown of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It focuses on important agricultural research for developing countries. This year ACIAR will invest more than $94 million - an increase on last year - in agricultural research and, specifically, $5 million for PNG, which is also an increase on last year's budget. Specifically, ACIAR's research in PNG focuses on the hurdles that farmers face. So the research goes to high-value crops, higher yield seeds, better feed for livestock and similar. But the research has also shown that, if women are given access to agricultural research and training, farm productivity increases by about 20 or 30 per cent. We have got a program called Liklik Bisniss Thinking, which means 'small business thinking'. In the last six months 330 PNG women have been trained in small business techniques, and 250 heads of family have also been trained under this program.                 The member might be aware that, on 3 March, I announced 11 agricultural research scholarships, the John Dillon scholarships, which are funded through ACIAR. One of the recipients was Papua New Guinean woman Matilda Hamago. She is the first PNG woman to be awarded such a scholarship in agriculture research, and I certainly hope she is the first of many.                 The member might also be aware that the aid budget that we inherited from the Labor government was in an utter shambles. Over the last 15 months of that Labor government, they announced and then withdrew $5.7 billion from the forward estimates of the aid budget. We have now stabilised the aid budget. It will be $5 billion a year. It will be a responsible, affordable, sustainable budget focusing on our region, focusing on Papua New Guinea. A pillar of it will be the economic empowerment of women in our region. So we will continue to provide support, particularly for women in the region, in the area of agriculture.

  I thank the member for Pearce for his question. It is always a pleasure to receive a question from him. I am sorry, but I have bad news. After 105 days the carbon tax, which is doing its damage to the Western Australian economy, remains stuck in the Senate.                 Members may remember that a former member of this House, Pat Farmer, ran from the North Pole to the South Pole. After 105 days, he had crossed the Arctic, travelled down the Canadian coast and passed through New York, and, on his own feet, he was halfway down the US coast. After 105 days, the Leader of the Opposition cannot even be bothered to get up and walk from here to the Senate to get his members in the Senate to vote for the repeal of the carbon tax. We have had 105 days and nothing - no action, inaction, a go slow and a strike.                 Why does this matter? Because the member is correct: it is a $172 million hit on Woodside Energy, but more than that, it is a $627 million hit on Western Australian firms alone. Within the oil and gas sector - a sector which is facing attacks not faced by its competitors in the Middle East, Vietnam and Indonesia - that tax alone costs $265 million. It is not just costing Woodside. It is costing the Burrup project $55 million, Apache Energy $17 million, DBNGP $5 million and Chevron, Mitsui and APCO all $3 million. Wesfarmers had a $2 million hit and BGC, Gold Fields, EDL, Vermilion and ENI all paid a million dollars in carbon tax in the last financial year alone. What does that mean? It means that in a globally competitive environment, where capital decisions are made on the return on investment, Western Australian firms are being hit with a tax not paid by their competitors.                 That is precisely why in the last two weeks we have heard the CEO of BHP, Andrew Mackenzie, speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the United States making the point that the carbon tax is, 'a tax that was designed in a way that was actually very injurious of Australia's competitiveness'. Only today, we heard the president of GE make it absolutely clear in terms of Australia that the government has the mandate to repeal the carbon tax. If you want to do something for Western Australia, go and tell your senators to pass the repeal and get out of the way.

  I thank the member for Casey for his question and note that he was there the last time we came into government and inherited a budgetary mess from Labor. It is like groundhog day, in a sense, except the problem seems to be worse. The fact is that Labor have left us, according to the IMF survey of 17 nations, with the highest projected spending of the top 17 nations in the world over the next few years. They have left us with the third highest projected growth in net debt of those 17 nations over the next few years. That is a great Labor legacy, apart from the $123 billion of deficit and $667 billion of debt. The fact is that Labor has left the Australian government without any chance of a surplus at all - ever - over the next 10 years. That is their great legacy.                 In leaving that massive log jam of increased expenditure, without the revenue available to deal with it, they have left us to make the hard decisions in relation to the budget and we will because we must. The fact is that Labor has deluded itself for a number of years and its legacy of economic incompetence, its legacy of largesse and its legacy of deficit and debt comes at a cost to the economy. The only way you can fix the economy is to start by fixing the budget. That is the only way you can do it. There are no choices here. Labor can cry all it wants about the Commission of Audit. They should know the answers because they created the problems.                 They created the problems when it comes to blow-outs in expenditure in health, in education and in social services more generally. They pushed beyond the forward estimates massive increases in defence expenditure, in foreign aid and in a range of other things, but they do not care because Labor does not care about the future. Their disregard for the future is best illustrated by the fact that they have left future generations of Australians with $667 billion of debt. It is contemporary, because in the Senate right now Labor is opposing $20 billion of savings that will start to fix the budget. They announced $5 billion of those savings themselves. So they are not only not true to their principles but they are living hypocrites when it comes to the budget.                     I withdraw.

  How low has a once-great party sunk when some pathetic scare about the Commission of Audit - a report to government, not a report by government - is the best they can do? This is the best they can do: a pathetic, embarrassing scare campaign which shows that members opposite have no answers for our future. The Labor Party might have a past to be proud of, a past that boasted great prime ministers, like Bob Hawke, and great reformers, like Paul Keating. They must be embarrassed at what has happened to a once great political party. If members opposite are serious about doing the right thing by Western Australians, they should let us get the carbon tax repeal legislation through the Senate. They should let us get the mining tax repeal legislation through the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition over in Perth tries to give people the impression that he does not support the mining tax; here in Canberra, he will not abolish it. I cannot and will not say that he is a hypocrite. I know that he has what is described as situational principles - that is what he has got! Someone whose political principles are situational is not fit to be a national leader.

  The previous member for Lindsay had a habit of visiting Darwin and going out to look for boats off our northern coast. If I were to invite the new member for Lindsay to join me to go to Darwin she would not find many boats up there because, I can inform the House, it has been 88 days since the last successful people-smuggling venture to Australia. As the Prime Minister was saying before, this is a government that is known for what it achieves. Eighty-eight days without a successful people-smuggling venture is the product of this government's policies, and the resolve of this government is what is achieving those results day in, day out.                  As I move around the country, I find great support for the government's achievements in this area. It would seem there are still those opposite who doubt the effectiveness or wisdom of the policies that the government is putting in place on our borders. The chief of those who are in doubt about these policies is none other than the Leader of the Opposition himself. On four occasions last week he was asked by David Speers whether he supported this government's policy to turn back the boats - a policy they opposed at the last election, a policy they said could never be done, was impossible to do and would never work. He could not give a response. When he was asked it had been 80 days; now it is 88 days, and I am interested to know whether he supports it now. Despite this evidence, he still finds himself unable to support the policies that are working on our borders.                 The Leader of the Opposition's standards are not high, because he was able to agree with former Prime Minister Gillard when he did not even know what she had said. He does not have terribly high standards when it comes to these things, but I would hope that having seen the success on our borders he would be able to bring himself to admit that those on the other side got it wrong on our borders. They got the policy wrong. Now when they see a policy working they should embrace it.                 The people of Western Australia have to go to a Senate election and they know what this coalition stands for when it comes to our borders. There is no doubt about what those on this side stand for when it comes to border protection, but on that side it is a complete blank page. You would not know what this Leader of the Opposition thought about anything. He needs a GPS to find his principles when it comes to anything. On border protection it is no different, because even when it is presented to him, despite the fact that he declines to attend briefings, he still does not believe.

  I thank the member for Bennelong for his question. In addition to the Prime Minister's statement at the commencement of question time today concerning his phone call with his Malaysian counterpart, Prime Minister Najib, I can inform the House that, immediately after the Australian government became aware that Malaysia Airlines flight 370 was missing, the Prime Minister contacted Prime Minister Najib. Likewise, I contacted Foreign Minister Anifah to offer our sympathies and support, and whatever assistance was required. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in extending my thoughts and prayers to the families and friends of those aboard the flight. It is clearly a deeply distressing and agonising time for them all.                 I can confirm that, from the outset, Australian officials have been in close contact with Malaysian authorities on efforts to locate the missing flight. On Sunday 9 March Australia deployed two RAAF P-3C Orions - our maritime surveillance aircraft - to support the search coordinated by Malaysian authorities. From 15 March this search has relocated from the South China Sea to two flight corridors north from Malaysia to Kazakhstan and south from Indonesia into the southern Indian Ocean. Our Chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley, last night advised that Malaysian authorities had re-tasked our aircraft in response to the changed area of search operations. Yesterday one Orion commenced searching the Indian Ocean to the north and west of the Cocos Islands, and it is continuing its search operations in the area today. Our second aircraft will continue to search west of Malaysia. I can inform the House that, as of yesterday, the two Orions had flown more than 50 hours in search missions as part of the international effort.                 In addition, as part of the search missions - there are currently 14 countries assisting - all our Defence intelligence relating to flight 370 has been, and will continue to be, passed on to Malaysian authorities, who are ultimately responsible for providing updated public information on efforts to locate this flight. There is an enormous international search effort underway. As the Prime Minister has indicated, Australia stands ready to provide whatever additional support might be required. In the meantime, I can confirm that our consular officials will continue to keep in regular contact with the families of the Australians on board.

  The support in question comes through a much larger benefit, which is made available to many tens of thousands of people. We were up-front with people before the election that this particular benefit would be removed, because it was a benefit that was supposed to be paid for by the mining tax, and the mining tax is not raising any money. I accept that this will be unpopular - no-one wants to lose a benefit. But we cannot go on spending money that we do not have. We cannot go on being generous with borrowed money, and this is the problem. This leader of the opposition is trying to embarrass the government because the government is keeping its commitments. That is the whole point - we are prepared to commit to tough policies up-front, before an election, when the people have a choice. We were elected on the basis of these policies, and, unlike this leader of the opposition, if we commit to something before an election, we keep that commitment after an election. It is as simple as that, and I think that the Australian people are big enough to understand that yes, some tough decisions do need to be made. We promised tough decisions, and they will be as tough and as fair as they need to be.

  I thank the Member for Eden-Monaro for his question and acknowledge his longstanding and very strong support for the veteran community, not just in his electorate but around the country. Consistent with our election commitments, the government will provide fair indexation for DFRB and DFRDB military superannuant pensions to ensure a fair dinkum deal for our ADF personnel and their families. On 1 January this year we put in place our fair dinkum deal for free ADF health care for our families.                     And if the Senate would move, we could actually save $80 million -                      which is the cost to the Defence force on the carbon tax.                   The member for Lingiari then left the chamber.                     The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator the Hon. Michael Ronaldson, and I have been working with the department to ensure this policy will be in place by 1 July this year. As a result of this policy, 57,000 DFRDB and DFRB superannuants will be better off. And I say to the Member for Eden-Monaro: that includes 813 retired Defence Force members and 132 dependants in your electorate. This initiative has been a long time coming. This week, this government will proudly put this legislation into the House to fulfil another election commitment we made to the Australian people and to Australia's veterans. We are proud to put the welfare of our veterans first and foremost.                     So let us compare this to those opposite -                      Those opposite did not even go to the election with a veterans' policy. In fact, your veterans' policy was a blank sheet of paper. In 2007 those opposite promised to index pensions, and then six long years later - six years of nothing, six years of self-serving reviews - they delivered nothing. And whilst the Labor opposition capitulated -                      That is the great thing about the truth: it hurts, doesn't it. Six years of indecision, and six years of nothing. Well, veterans do not have to wait six years, six months, or even six days, because we will get this done in this House in the coming days. It was interesting to see in the last few days of last year's election the former government capitulate and put in a half-hearted attempt. Not an attempt to help veterans out, but an attempt to try to help Mike Kelly out in his seat of Eden-Monaro. Well, that didn't go so well, because the veterans saw through a half-hearted, 11th hour response. We will index military pensions. We will stand up for those who are serving. We will do it properly and we will do it now.

  I know exactly what members opposite are trying to do. They are trying to present this government as callous and hard-hearted. The truth that members opposite seem to have forgotten is that this was an election commitment that we made. We said that in order to help repair the budget -                    The member for Jagajaga then left the chamber.                     In order to deal with the $123 billion of prospective deficits, in order to deal with the $667 billion of cumulative debt that Labor was running up, we would not continue the Income Support Bonus. The Income Support Bonus is paid to tens of thousands of people. Amongst those people are some of those mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I can also inform the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we are not going to continue the Schoolkids Bonus, and 1,780 Department of Veterans' Affairs clients receive the Schoolkids Bonus. Presumably we should continue the Schoolkids Bonus on that same logic, because 1,780 DVA clients receive it.                     I just want to make this fundamental point: no government can continue to be generous with other people's money. No government can continue to be generous with borrowed money. We said that the Income Support Bonus would go.                     We said that the Schoolkids Bonus would go. We were honest and upfront about that before the election, and we will do it after the election, because our fundamental task is to ensure that this government lives within its means. Our fundamental task is to repair the budget because, as the Treasurer said in question time today, if you want to fix the economy then you have got to fix the budget first. We will fix the budget, and we will fix the economy.

  Thank you to the member for Ryan for a great question, and the great work she does for 14,500 small businesses operating in her electorate. We know, as she knows - as we hope most of this House would know - that small business is groaning under the regulatory burden introduced by the previous government. As many as 21,000 new or amended regulations were introduced by Labor in just six years, and we know small business does the heavy lifting in creating jobs and economic opportunities. They do not expect to be the heavy lifters of regulation, red-tape, and compliance burdens in this economy.                 We went to the election with a commitment to remove a billion dollars worth of red tape out of the economy, a billion dollars -                      that will free up the burden that gums up the economy with excessive and unnecessary red-tape. We have tried, we have good form on this.                     We have fantastic form on this. We have tried for years to lift the pay-clerk burden off employers under the government's paid parental leave scheme. We have tried, but it has been voted down twice by Labor. They said it was so important to impose this burden, for which there was no policy justification at all - just cost and compliance burdens for those left to administer it. Then in the dying days of the election campaign, what did Labor realise? That the pay-clerk burden is completely unjustified. They came out looking for a small business policy, could come up with no ideas of their own, and despite having voted against this measure twice when they were in government, they suddenly promised they would follow the coalition. We tested that resolve. We put forward a measure to end the pay-clerk burden, to save the business community $44 million, and guess what happened? Labor went back to type. They forgot about their election promises, they forgot about the red-tape compliance burden, they voted against $44 million of compliance cost savings that would have resulted from relieving the business community of the pay-clerk burden.                 We will persevere Member for Ryan. Please reassure your electorate that we will persevere. We know that small business does the heavy lifting in creating jobs, economic opportunity and prosperity in this country. We know that under Labor our position on government regulation, when compared by the World Economic Forum, saw Australia fall from 68th to 128th - hardly the kind of performance record you want. We want to turn that around. The government is committed to doing it - lifting this red-tape burden of the PPL pay-clerk is part of that.                 For those opposite, if you want to see how we are going, check out a great website. It is www.cuttingredtape.gov.au, for those businesses that are dealing with needless, pointless, expensive red tape. Contribute to this work. We are committed to lifting a billion dollars of red tape and putting the enterprise back into our economy. We will persevere in getting this PPL pay-clerk lifted off as a red-tape burden on our economy.

  The Leader of the Opposition is trying to suggest that somehow we are singling out the children of veterans for bad treatment. We are not. We are removing the income support bonus as we committed to doing before the election, because it is a payment funded by the mining tax, and the mining tax is not raising any money. There are tens of thousands of people who will lose the income support bonus, and I do not suppose that any of them will be very happy to lose it. But I do imagine that most of them will understand that the government made this commitment up-front, before the election, and we will deliver upon it after the election.                 But this idea that the children of veterans are somehow being singled out for mistreatment by government is simply false. It is simply false. It is an outrageous smear and it is a comment on this Leader of the Opposition that he should suggest that we are somehow targeting veterans' children. Let me say that the children of veterans, depending upon their circumstances, will receive annual payments of up to $13,312 a year and there are additional payments for single orphans of up to $1,036 a year. They are the facts. Now, it is true that tens of thousands of people will no longer get the particular bonus in question.                 But, as I said, it was a policy that we took to the election and we were absolutely up-front with people. People were under no illusions as to what was happening. This particular payment was going, and it will go.                 Leave not granted.

  I am delighted to get a question from the member for Deakin about the government keeping its commitments in school education. I have to say that recently I had the opportunity to announce the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group.                 It completed one of the pillars that the government took to the election about how we are going to address student outcomes at our schools, putting students first. We had already announced a review of the national curriculum to have the most robust curriculum possible. We have already announced a $70 million fund because we want to expand independent public schools. We know that the more autonomy that a school has, the better the results for students and the higher the expectations for students, which means that we are putting students first. Then I announced the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group, because all of the research, whether it is our own local research or whether it is the OECD PISA study, shows that in Australia, more than any other OECD country, the most important factor that affects a student's outcome is the quality of the teachers. That report found that eight out of 10 influences on a student's results will be the classroom to which they are allocated in a school - not their social background and not the curriculum but the classrooms to which they are allocated in a school. So we are focusing on the issues that matter in education: more autonomy for schools; a better curriculum for schools; higher teacher quality in schools.                     Support comes from the strangest places. Some members of the House might remember my old sparring partner, Julia Gillard. She was the Minister for Education when I was the shadow minister for education, and then she was the Prime Minister pretending to be the 'education prime minister', and I was the Manager of Opposition Business in the House and continued to be the shadow minister for education -                      I used to say the same things for years and years and years - that education was not just about money but about curriculum, teacher quality and autonomy.                   The member for Perth then left the chamber.                     The former Prime Minister, the former Minister of Education, never said that. For six years, she always used to maintain that more money would solve every problem. And do you know what she said on 24 February, free from the shackles of government, free from the shackles of the prime ministership? At the Brookings Institute she said:                 One of the things in developed countries like Australia is, actually, the amount of money going into education has been increasing but learning outcomes have not been increasing.                 So support comes from the strangest of places. The former education minister, the former Prime Minister, is lining up with the new member for Perth and the government in insisting that money is not everything; it is all the other things that we are doing in education.

  The suggestion from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this government is somehow against veterans and their children is simply false. Any idea that this government is against veterans is simply false.                     We have an interjection from one of the opposition frontbenchers that words are cheap. Let me just make this point to him. One of the big issues for veterans was the proper indexation of the DFRDB and the DFRB pensions. We made that commitment before the election and we are delivering on that commitment after the election. We promised before the election that the income support bonus would go - we made that up-front and clear before the election. We said that this particular bonus would go. It is true that some veterans and their families receive this bonus. They knew before the election that this bonus would go. Veterans, like everyone else, understand that governments have to keep their commitments. They also understand, like everyone else, that you cannot be generous with money that you just do not have. We should never forget that members opposite -                      billed $13 billion worth of spending against a tax which has raised just $300 million this year. Members of the veterans community understand that if you want to defend our country, if you want to do the right thing by veterans, you have got to have a strong economy, you have got to have a strong budget, and that is what this government is determined to deliver.

  Thank you very much to the honourable member for his question. Governments have two choices: you can either spend money in front-line services in health or you can spend it in great big new bureaucracies in Canberra. The Labor Party of course created 12 great big new bureaucracies in Canberra and it meant they were taking money away from services in Western Australia. This government will not make the same mistake. We will make sure that we deliver on our promises - and when I speak of promises it is very interesting to have a look at some of the promises that Labor made in their GP superclinic program.                 It was a $650 million program. It was borrowed money. They promised 64 of these so-called superclinics around the country: they were to pop up with taxpayers' assistance and they were to provide competition against existing medical practices. The difficulty was that even though these were promised in some cases on multiple occasions, some of them have not yet even started work. They have not seen a patient as yet.                 WA is a classic example. If you are living in Western Australia and you are asking, 'What would the Labor Party do for me in terms of health services?' look at their track record. The problem was that the member for Sydney, the former health minister Tanya Plibersek, Minister Plibersek, promised six of these in Western Australia. Do you know how many have been delivered? Only one - just one. Sure, by Labor standards she is an overachiever. One in six, about a 16 per cent success rate, makes you a roaring success of the Rudd-Gillard years, Tanya Plibersek, but let me tell you it does not make much difference in the lives of those people in Western Australia.                 In the last parliamentary sitting week we also discussed a very important promise that Labor had made in relation to a GP superclinic at Karratha in Western Australia. The former minister, the member for Sydney, hopped up to make a personal explanation at the end of question time and she said:                 The Karratha GP superclinic has been offering early services since 2 May 2012.                     As I pointed out last week, the Karratha superclinic, despite having been promised twice by Labor, has not yet started construction. It is very cheeky, but when you look at the words of the former minister she talks about 'early services'. They have been offering early services, have they? Do you know what that means? It means the superclinic has not been built, patients are not being seen, doctors are not providing those services. You have put money into an existing clinic and call that a superclinic. Somehow, that is justification for spending $650 million in this program. The people of Western Australia will not be fooled twice. The Rockingham GP superclinic was promised in 2010 and 2012. They will not fall for Labor's false promises again.

  The short answer is 'yes', but, because the Leader of the Opposition has been seeking a statement on this matter, let me satisfy him. It is important to maintain the highest possible standards in our public life. I want to stress to the House and to the Australian community that people should be in public life to serve our country and not themselves. There are important matters being investigated by the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption. In respect of Senator Sinodinos, the matters in question happened prior to his entering parliament and becoming a minister. The senator has been asked to assist an inquiry into a particular company; he is doing so fully and frankly, as you would expect. Senator Sinodinos has served our country long and faithfully as a Treasury official and as the chief of staff to a Prime Minister, as well as a member of this parliament. Quite properly, Senator Sinodinos has kept the Senate updated on this matter, and I refer people to his statements.

  I do thank the member for his question and I wish to assure him and other members of this House that every day the government are purposefully and methodically implementing our plan to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. A key element in that plan is cutting business red-tape costs by at least $1 billion a year every year. This is essential if we are to get our competitiveness and our productivity up.                 I regret to say that the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness ranking shows that Australia has slipped by some six places in the last five years. We are now, regrettably, only 21st in the world on the global competitiveness ranking. When it comes to the burden of government regulation ranking, I regret to say that Australia is 128th in the world. We are behind Romania, but the good news is we are ahead of Angola. On the Economist's productivity growth ranking, I regret to say that we are second last. We are 51st in the countries ranked, ahead of just Botswana.                 So we do need to get our productivity and our competitiveness up, and cutting red tape is an essential part of that. Scrapping the carbon tax will not only remove a $9 billion-a-year handbrake on our economy; it will not only save the households of Bonner $550 a year but save $85 million every year in business red-tape costs. Scrapping the mining tax will not only boost investment but save $11 million every year in business red-tape costs. A one-stop shop when it comes to offshore environmental approvals will not only be good for investment but, according to the Office of Best Practice Regulation, save $120 million a year every year in business red-tape costs.                 I can inform the House that tomorrow the government will outline to this House details of the repeal of some 10,000 redundant acts of parliament and regulations. We will scrap all of these in our repeal day - the first repeal day of this government. It will be the biggest bonfire of regulations in our history. I want to thank the parliamentary secretary for his work.                     I also wanted to thank the member for Higgins for her work in opposition, which has prepared for the good work that this government is doing now.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and I note that, on every indicator that we inherited from the previous government, Australia has been lagging behind many others in the world.                     Oh, Labor has such a proud record! $123 billion of deficit - that's a great record!                     And, of course, the Labor Party left us over the last five years with economic growth at below trend. What does that mean? It means that 200,000 Australians have lost their jobs.                     I see there is an interjection from the member for Lilley, who has a very nice suntan. He has been spending a lot of time explaining how good he was to the rest of the world.                   The member for Rankin then left the chamber.                     I am sure that during that explanation, which must have gone on for a lengthy one-week period -                    The member for Franklin then left the chamber.                     The member for Lilley, who was the architect of the mining tax, who was the architect of the carbon tax, who oversaw an economy that over five years had four years of below-trend growth -                    The member for Gellibrand then left the chamber.                     The member for Lilley, who said he would deliver a surplus not once, not twice but 321 times, did not deliver one single surplus, but he put a newsletter around his electorate saying he had actually delivered a surplus. I love you, Swannie; come back!                     The member for Lilley, former Treasurer - the world's greatest, apparently -                      No, no, don't humour him; I'm trying to encourage him! The fact is he was the architect of the mining tax that is now being debated in the Senate.                   The member for Parramatta then left the chamber.                     I say to the member for Lilley, as I say to the Leader of the Opposition: do not go to Perth and tell them how much you hate that mining tax and then come back here and vote against repealing it. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: be consistent from one side of the continent to the other. Come back here, vote against the mining tax and give the people of Western Australia a chance to have more jobs.

  We would like to restart the mining boom by scrapping the mining tax and scrapping the carbon tax. That is our plan for Western Australia. Our plan for Western Australia is to get rid of these anti-Western Australian taxes, the carbon tax and the mining tax. Even the Leader of the Opposition wants to get rid of the mining tax when he is in Western Australia. It is just that he opposes it in Western Australia and supports it here in Canberra, where it counts. I suggest to the member who asked the question - and I am sure he does genuinely want to help the people of Western Australia - that, if he thought about it, if he wanted to help the people of Western Australia in reality as well as just in theory, he would change his position on the mining tax and the carbon tax. He would vote to scrap these anti-Western Australian taxes which are holding back the people of that great state.

  I thank the member for Swan for asking such an important question about roads in Western Australia. Of course, whereas the other side proposes to fund roads with a mining tax that does not raise any money, we have fully funded and fully budgeted projects that will make a real difference to Western Australia. Included amongst them is a $686 million commitment to the Gateway WA project in Perth. A real welcome to the state of Western Australia which will demonstrate what a significant state this is; a state that is able to contribute mightily to our nation's prosperity.                     The reality is that certainly the minister had some photo opportunities around this project, but he never produced any money. It was going to be funded from the mining tax. The mining tax that could not even build a footpath, let alone the Gateway project in Western Australia! But that is not all: we have a $615 million commitment to the Swan Valley bypass - another project that Labor thought it might fund through the proceeds of its mining tax. But what is more, Labor only promised 50 per cent of the cost of that project. They were determined to short-sheet the Western Australian government and provide only half of the money -                    The member for Grayndler then left the chamber.                     that was required to get that project underway. We have added $197 million and therefore will guarantee that this project will actually happen.                 There is $146 million to the Tonkin Highway, $307 million for the Great Northern Highway, $174 million for the North West Coastal Highway, $59 million for the Leach Highway and $42 million for the Great Eastern Highway, and the list goes on. There are $3.8 billion worth of commitments to Western Australia, all fully funded and fully budgeted.                 Labor, of course, also promised a number of projects - plenty of pictures - but over half of the money that they intended to supply for these projects came from the mining tax. A mining tax that has done real damage to the Western Australian economy but not raised real money. Therefore, Labor's promises were empty. They were a vacuum.                     They were essentially picture opportunities, but there was no money there to actually deliver. If the people of Western Australia want these projects delivered, there is only one way for that to happen and that is to make sure that we have a coalition government in Canberra and one that has a majority in the Senate so that these projects can be delivered.

  I wish to reassure the Legacy organisation, and everyone who has benefited from Legacy, that the Veterans' Children Education Scheme is not ending. The Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme is not ending. These schemes are absolutely supported by the coalition. What is ending -                      Every scheme that is directed toward veterans and their families is being supported. Not only that but this government is about to properly index the DFRDB and DFRB pensions - a promise that members opposite made and then reneged on between 2007 and 2013.                 What is ending is an income support bonus, because it was funded by the mining tax - which is not raising any money. We were absolutely up-front and clear about this before the election, and what we said we would do before an election we will do after an election. What we are not going to do is what members opposite did repeatedly for six years. That is, try to be generous with money they do not have; try to be compassionate with other people's money - that is not our style. We will do the right thing by everyone in this country, including veterans of this country, and we start doing the right thing by the people of this country by repairing the budget - because, if you do not repair the budget, you cannot repair our economy.

  The member for Durack is right. The fight goes on to help control unwanted electricity bills. We will not rest until we make an impact on these electricity bills.                     Today is day 106. The filibuster continues in the Senate. Last night Labor senators debated, debated and debated -                      but they did introduce something new. They introduced their own amendments, not to abolish the carbon tax but to change its name. It was a watershed moment. They were going to change the name of the carbon tax, not abolish it. There are those who have said that the Leader of the Opposition might say one thing in Western Australia and another thing here in Canberra about the mining tax. I am sorry to say that that pattern continues with the carbon tax. He is pretending that he and the ALP want to abolish the carbon tax when all they are doing is changing its name. Do not take my word for this.                     Somebody else spoke in the Senate last night. What was it that Senator Milne, a co-architect of the carbon tax, had to say not about what we were doing but about Labor's own amendments to change the name of the carbon tax? Senator Milne just last night said:                 _ this ridiculous position where we have the Labor Party pretending that what they want to move for is emissions trading.                 In other words, Senator Milne was saying it is a name change. It is nothing more than a name change. Why does that matter to the people of Western Australia? It means that, in the fight for the Western Australian Senate, it is a fight for the carbon tax, which is what they are arguing for -                      or against the carbon tax, which is what the people voted for and which is what we are presenting as we go to this Western Australian election. How much is this worth to the people of Western Australia? Western Australia's electricity bill alone is $344 million. That is $191 million for electricity generation, $60 million for Bluewaters, $27 million for Alinta, $17 million for NewGen and $6 million for ATCO. The list is continuous and it is paid for not by members in this House but by Western Australians through their power bills at home, in their small businesses and in their large operations where people are employed. The message is very clear. Do not change the name of the carbon tax. Do what the people of Australia elected this parliament to do.                     That is, get out of the way and allow the carbon tax to be repealed.

  I wish to stress to the Leader of the Opposition that the Veterans' Children Education Scheme stays. The Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme stays. What is not staying is the income support bonus. The income support bonus went to hundreds of thousands of people; it was not something that only went to the children of veterans. It goes to hundreds of thousands of people. We were very up-front before the election that the income support bonus would go. We said this before the election. We are doing it after the election. People expect us to keep our commitments. We were prepared before the election to be up-front about tough decisions - something that gentleman has never been prepared to be.

  I thank the member for Moore for his question. I note his deep interest in economic growth in the state of Western Australia. I will be hosting the Mongolian foreign minister, Bold Luvsanvandan, today. This is the first visit by a Mongolian foreign minister in 20 years. We very much welcome his visit because it is an opportunity for us to discuss the enhanced trade and investment ties between Mongolia and Australia. Indeed, there is an increasing number of Australian mining and resource companies that are investing in Mongolia. In particular I give the example of Rio Tinto, which is now in a joint venture with the Mongolian government in a gold and copper mine. A number of other Australian mining companies are investing. And why wouldn't they? Because, as the foreign minister of Mongolia said today, 'Our new model for foreign direct investment is very much designed for Australian businesses - we're offering stability, openness and lower tax.' That is not something that the Labor government could ever offer Australian businesses. They could not offer them stability, openness or lower taxes. Back in 2009 when the Labor economic dream team of former Prime Minister Rudd and former Treasurer Swan -                      Back in 2009 when the Labor economic dream team were designing a mining tax -                      to impose on Australian mining companies, Mongolia was rescinding its mining tax. Back in 2009 Mongolia knew that to get foreign investment, to get jobs and to get growth they had to get rid of an unnecessary mining tax. In fact, it was said at the time:                 The votes today -                  in the Mongolian parliament -                  by overwhelming majorities _ represent a significant step in Mongolia's commitment to attract foreign investment in the development of the country's mineral resources.                     Good on Mongolia! But just months later, 'back to the future' Labor imposes the very mining tax that Mongolia had gotten rid of. So Mongolia understands what the Australian government understands, what internationally competitive economies understand and what the Labor Party refuses to understand, and that is: unnecessary mining taxes are bad for jobs, bad for the Western Australian economy and bad for internationally competitive economies. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who has shown his policy cowardice with his nod, nod, wink, wink in Western Australia, 'We don't oppose the mining tax' -                      But he is such a big-noting hero back here: he is going to stand up to the repeal of the mining tax. The Leader of the Opposition should get with Mongolia, get to the 21st century, and repeal the mining tax.

  No specific payment to veterans' families is being cut. This is simply untrue. Now for the -                      The Veterans' Children Education Scheme continues, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme continues. Under these schemes, eligible secondary students aged between 16 and 25 and still living at home receive fortnightly non-means tested payments.                     This one is on relevance. I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the question -                      Under these schemes, eligible secondary students receive non-means tested payments of between $230.70 and $277.40 per fortnight. Students living independently can receive up to $421.40 per fortnight. Payments to orphans are up to $512 per fortnight. In addition to that, a special financial assistance payment of up to $4,000 a year is also payable and up to $2,000 in additional tuition fees can also be funded. We were absolutely up-front that the income support bonus was going.                     We were absolutely up-front about the fact that the income support bonus was going. If I may say so, we were quite bold before the election, because we said that we were going to remove a payment that went to 1.2 million people.                     Maybe members opposite did not notice but we said that this particular payment that goes to 1.2 million people was going. So we were absolutely -                    The member for Wakefield then left the chamber -                      We were absolutely up-front that the income support bonus was going.                     Repeatedly. We also told -                      Maybe the Leader for the Opposition was out to lunch, but it was our policy to remove the income support bonus.                     What we said we would do before the election we will do after the election.

  I can confirm that the former member for Dobell is in the Magistrates Court today making submissions on sentencing for stealing union members' funds. He was found guilty of stealing $24,000 from the members of the Health Services Union, amongst the lowest paid workers in Australia. Unfortunately, that was not the only scandal involving the Health Services Union. The former federal president of the Australian Labor Party, Michael Williamson, was also found guilty of defrauding the members of the Health Services Union of their funds.                 The government's response has been to introduce a bill to establish a registered organisations commission to protect workers rather than to protect dodgy union bosses. On this side of the House, the coalition is the friend of the workers. We want to protect workers. On that side of the House, the Labor Party wants to protect dodgy union bosses. Can I also add that the opposition's response to this attempt to protect workers has been to block the registered organisations commissions bill in the Senate. Rather than recognising the failures in the past of their policies that led to Craig Thomson stealing money from the Health Services Union workers, or Michael Williamson stealing money, when we made an attempt to fix it, their response has been to block it in the Senate. I should also report to the House that startlingly today the former member for Dobell offered to pay back the $24,000 that he was found guilty of stealing from members of the Health Services Union -                    The member for Charlton then left the chamber.                     showing up the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party because amazingly, while the former member for Dobell, the disgraced Craig Thomson, offered to pay back $24,000 of Health Services Union workers' dues, Labor has refused to pay back the $267,000 that they used to help the former member for Dobell -                      For the elucidation of the Manager of Opposition Business, the question was about the establishment of the Registered Organisations Commission.  In order to explain why it is important, one needs to explain the context, which is that the former member for Dobell has offered to pay back $24,000 today and that $267,000 of Health Services Union members' money was used to elect him in 2007 as a Labor member of parliament.                     Labor held on to his votes for six years in government. If the Leader of the Opposition had any decency, if he could rise above his background, if he could be Bob Hawke rather than small Bill Shorten, he would be pay back that $267,000 of Health Services Union members' money.

  The question from the shadow minister is simply misleading, it is simply false. We said over the forward estimates period you would get exactly the same amount of money under the coalition or under the Labor Party. We are actually going to do better than that because in the PEFO statement members opposite cut $1.2 billion from schools in Western Australia, in Queensland and in the Northern Territory. I have to say that, to the great benefit of schools in Western Australia, we put the $1.2 billion back. It is interesting that the shadow minister stands up to ask a question today because she was asked a question herself on Sky News by David Lipson - it is not just David Speers who reduces opposition front benchers to bumbling into coherence. She was asked, 'Will you take to the next election a promise to restore funding in years five and six for the Gonski education funding model?', a very simple question. 'What are you going to do in years five and six?' The shadow minister said, 'Look, what we're focused on is the budget that is in eight weeks time.'                   The member for Lalor then left the chamber.                      David Lipson again asked, 'Will Labor commit to take that funding for years five and six to the next election?' This is what the shadow minister said, 'But David, it might not shock you to know this is not our election policy launch.' Really and truly: get real, get real!

  I thank the honourable member for Tangney for his question. There is no part of Australia where telecommunications are more vital than Western Australia. The vast distances and remote communities demand the most modern and cost-effective telecommunications, and the government is absolutely committed to ensuring that they are available in Western Australia. The biggest challenge we face is the colossal mess left by the Labor Party after six years of catastrophic mismanagement of telecommunications. The National Broadband Network, which was so disappointing right across the country, completely failed in Western Australia. At the time of the election only 4,000 brownfield premises had been passed and only 75 have been activated. We are getting it back on track and now 32,000 premises have been passed. The interim satellite is so important to Western Australia. The Labor Party told a quarter of a million Australians, many in Western Australia, that they were eligible to access the interim satellite. However, due to shocking mismanagement, NBN Co only bought enough capacity to serve 48,000 people and then it delivered to them a service that was little better than dial-up - again, an epic fail.                  The biggest issue in regional Australia is mobile broadband and telecommunications. In the Howard years, $145 million was spent on dealing with mobile black spots. Kevin Rudd was asked what his government was doing about mobile black spots.                     This is what the previous Prime Minister said:                  What we are doing, right across the nation, is, region by region, locality by locality, working our way through the black spots as they arise.                 That is what he said. He was systematic - he was absolutely systematic, I will give him that - and he was completely even-handed. Every locality was treated the same by the former Prime Minister - everybody got nothing. Not one cent was spent on mobile black spots across Australia. We are spending $100 million and a significant part of that will naturally be spent in Western Australia where there are so many black spots. Of course, when you get to the NBN's own wireless program, which was also a massive underperformer, the previous minister tried to explain away the problems by saying, 'We had not anticipated problems from there being so many tall trees.' Imagine, in regional Australia, tall trees! We must not be too hard on the previous minister, because his comment is understandable. You see, in Conrovia there are no trees - it is a complete wasteland.

  Labor promised 2,650 trades training centres but delivered less than 10 per cent of them. That is almost as bad as the former Minister for Health's performance when it comes to superclinics. When it comes to incompetence they are all of a piece.                     We are putting $1.2 billion back into schools funding that members opposite cut out of it in their pre-election fiscal outlook statement, and we are paying for it by not proceeding with a Labor campaign commitment.

  I thank the member for Dawson for his question and I am sure the people of Western Australia will also be interested in the answer to this question. It has been 89 days since the last successful people smuggling venture. If the Leader of the Opposition does not want to believe me maybe he would like to refer to the ABC website which has kept a log, since the election of this government, on how many boats have arrived and how many successful people smuggling ventures have occurred. They began the log after the election and I table it. I must say, I have not kept them very busy over the last 89 days. If they were performing that task under the previous government it would have been one of the biggest make-work schemes that existed under that government. It has been 89 days without boats, and it is six months since the front bench of this government was sworn in. Under this government, there have been more weeks without boats than with boats. I am sure that those who watched the 7.30 program last night, if they listened to what was said about our Navy, about Australia and about threats and 9-11 and all of that, would be very happy that this government is doing exactly what we said it would do when it comes to our borders.                  I was asked about what had happened under previous border protection regimes. It was not always the case that you would have had 89 days without a successful venture. I can tell you that, when Senator Chris Evans was the Minister for Immigration, the longest consecutive period of no boats coming was 61 days - 61 days is not bad. It went downhill after that, I have to say. When the now shadow Treasurer was immigration minister, the record was 23 days - not bad, though, according to the standard set by those who followed. Both the member for Gorton and the now Manager of Opposition Business: six days. They could not get through a week without a boat turning up on their watch. They tried everything under their policies except the policies that worked. They did everything but turn boats back where it was safe to do so, which is the policy and practice of this government. They did everything they could do except what actually worked in concert. They did everything possible without doing the things that actually worked.                     They still today in the Senate refuse to support this government's mandate to deny permanent visas to people who come illegally by boat to this country. They still think it is a good idea to honour the people smugglers' promise and give people who have come to this country illegally by boat a permanent visa to this country. No wonder the people of Australia do not know where those opposite stand on these issues. They know where we stand. Those opposite are a complete blank page.

  The methodology for unemployment and the terms of trade was recommended by the Treasury as an improvement on what happened under Labor, and thank God for that. Thank God for that, because Labor managed to get almost every single forecast wrong, including the one about promising to have a surplus.                      I know. Maybe I am short-changing them, because they did claim a surplus on numerous occasions, but they never actually delivered one. Of course, the Treasury looked at its own forecasting -                      The fact of the matter is that we want to have the most accurate forecast possible; that is what Treasury recommended, and that is what we accept. The methodology that they have used in MYEFO actually confirms the fact that Labor left the legacy of increasing deficits to $123 billion, of increasing debt to $667 billion and of below-trend growth, and they also left a legacy of higher unemployment: 6Â¼ per cent. That is their legacy of unemployment. When they came to government they inherited an unemployment rate of around four per cent. When they left government, they handed to us and to the Australian people an unemployment rate approaching 6Â¼ per cent, with 200,000 more Australians unemployed than when Labor first came into office. Does that cause any embarrassment to you, Bill? Does that cause any embarrassment to the Leader of the Opposition or to the shadow and former Treasurer? There is no sense of shame in Labor.                      There is no sense of shame that they left a slower economy, with bigger deficits, bigger debt and of course rising unemployment. There is no embarrassment, there is no shame, but there should be.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. He is a former Treasurer in Western Australia. He was charged with cleaning up Labor's mess. He has come to this parliament as a great champion for the people of Western Australia and he is very passionate about health needs within his electorate.                 I have reminded the House before on one or two occasions about what Labor hailed as the greatest success in the Health portfolio under the former minister, who has now turned quickly to her iPhone, playing fishes or birds or something on her iPhone.                      Really? Is that the priority now?                     It may have been out of order. The point is that this is a $650 million program - $650 million of Australian taxpayers' money that was borrowed from overseas because Labor had already run out of money by this stage. They promised 64 superclinics, and we know that not many of them were open by the time they left government in 2013. The Northam GP superclinic is a very interesting study, because they first promised the Northam GP superclinic in July 2010. They repromised it, of course, at the election in 2013. But, do you know, by the time they had left government, it had not even started construction. Not one patient and not one doctor had visited that vacant lot of land, and it was indicative of what was happening in the program elsewhere.                  Now, it can be career-limiting to correct your Prime Minister, but, Prime Minister, during question time today you did say that the member for Adelaide, the former education minister, achieved greater things than the former Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek. I can tell you 10 per cent was a success rate -                      It is true that in a moment of overachievement the former minister for education achieved a 10 per cent outcome in her program - well done. But the former health minister achieved 16 per cent, and I can tell you that that was an overachievement in the Rudd-Gillard years but it did not help patients. The problem is that the GP Super Clinics Program in Western Australia, where they promised six clinics, delivered only one. Only one has been delivered.                 But there has been a major development. I am very happy to inform and update the House on the major development in Western Australia. After four years, construction has started. Work has commenced on this particular site and under this government we will deliver services. Under Labor, they promised a lot but they delivered nothing.

  The fact of the matter is that the forecasts do obviously have an impact on the budget bottom line.                   The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     He is not the only clown in that circus over there. The fact of the matter is that the forecasts obviously have an impact on the budget bottom line. But the fact is that Labor got every forecast wrong and therefore ended up getting the budget bottom line consistently wrong. You could almost forgive them for getting their numbers wrong, but they are showing no sense of contrition about this.                     The forecasts that were presented in MYEFO did not have forecasts presented to us under the alternative scenario presented to Labor. Therefore, you cannot have a number that is the difference, you clown. You cannot work it out, because the numbers that were presented were on the forecasts presented by the Treasury.                 I was reading the transcript of the shadow Treasurer in his speech to the Deutsche Bank International Investor Mission, 12 March 2014, when he said:                 We believe in returning the budget to surplus over time, and we showed that we have the ability to make the types of decision necessary to bring it about it.                 You actually did not bring a surplus about. But that is contrary to what the then Treasurer, the member for McMahon, said to Fran Kelly when he said that Labor:                 _ have returned budget to surplus three years ahead of schedule and ahead of any other major advanced economy -                  I am getting questions from someone who not only promised a surplus but claimed to have delivered a surplus when, in fact, nothing of the sort ever happened. Why? Because now we know that the Labor Party's true legacy was to leave us with the burden of the fastest growth in spending of the 17 major IMF economies in the world. That is Labor's legacy. They have left us with the third-highest growth in net debt in the world, and on top of that: $123 billion of deficits, $667 billion of debt, rising unemployment, falling terms of trade and below trend growth. Labor should be very proud of that legacy - oh, what a feeling!

  I thank the member for Brisbane for her question and I acknowledge the deep concern that she has for the constituents of her electorate, particularly those constituents who are low-income workers and their families and their concerns for housing in the inner city areas of Brisbane in particular.                 Yes, I have seen the report in the Australian which the honourable member referred to. This is one of a series of emerging reports about the mismanagement of the previous Labor government of the National Rental Affordability Scheme. Indeed, what this report revealed was that a scheme which is taxpayer subsidised -                      to provide low-rental dwellings for the low-paid workers of Australia in this particular case has not been used to house low-income workers of Australia but has been used for up to 1,500 international students. So instead of providing for workers, it is providing for the investors and the developers in this case. This is just one of the failings of the National Rental Affordability Scheme. There are many other failings to it, including the fact that the targets for this scheme set by the Labor government have simply not been met.                 I was looking around seeing who might be responsible for this mismanagement. Indeed, there are a few candidates, because in six years of Labor government there were not one, not two, not three, not four, not five but six separate ministers responsible for housing. Housing became -                      One of them is making a noise at the moment.                     But the reality was that this housing portfolio became a game of musical chairs for the Labor government. But who do you think the prime suspect might be?                     The Minister for Health has an idea. The prime quiet achiever is the previous Minister for Housing, the member for Sydney, because she was warned about this failing and ignored it. The Queensland government was warned about this failing and closed the loophole. The Queensland government closed the loophole, but the member for Sydney, the then Minister for Housing - you rise, obviously, in the opposition the more incompetent you are, because she is now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - simply neglected to fix this loophole. So it is not just GP superclinics; it is the National Rental Affordability Scheme as well.                     Well, we will fix the mess left by Labor.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for her question and I understand her interest. I also understand Kerr's Hire's concerns because, under the rules as they stand, many short-term leases have to be registered - this means more form filling, more time wasting and more unnecessary expense. Red tape repeal day will fix this, as it will tackle many other instances of redundant and unnecessary regulation. No-one likes filling in forms - it costs time, it costs money and it costs jobs. That is why red tape repeal day is so important. I can advise the House that red tape repeal day will involve the attempt to scrap about 1,000 redundant acts of parliament, it will seek to remove almost 10,000 unnecessary or counterproductive regulations - it will seek to take 50,000 pages off the statute book - and it will deliver $720 million in red tape cost reductions this year and every year.                  This is good news for the businesses, the consumers and the workers of our country. It is at the heart of this government's agenda to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. And don't we need to get red tape down! Under the former government Australia's world competitiveness ranking slipped six places in just four years to 21. Under the former government, our burden of government regulation ranking sunk to No. 128 in the world - we are behind Romania but don't worry, we are still better than Angola. Under the former government, our productivity growth ranking slipped to second-last in the world - the only country we beat when it came to productivity growth was Botswana. This government will tackle the red tape which is suffocating Australian businesses by lighting the biggest bonfire of regulation in our history.

  I thank the honourable member for his question, because he knows that the only way that Western Australians will get the infrastructure that they need and deserve is from a coalition government. If Western Australia is to get world-class infrastructure it will be a coalition government that will provide it. Yesterday, the member for Grayndler claimed that the Gateway project in Western Australia was a 'fully funded $1 billion project under the previous Labor government', but the money was going to come from the mining tax, and the mining tax has not raised any money - so it was not a fully funded project. When he was speaking on 20 November about the repeal of the mining tax he also listed another lot of Western Australian projects, all of which he said were funded by the mining tax, such as the Great Northern Highway stage 2, $152 million to the North West Coastal Highway and the Swan Valley bypass. The reality is that the mining tax has not raised any money.                  Now, if the member for Grayndler does not think that is a problem, perhaps he should talk to the member for Lilley, the former Treasurer, because the member for Lilley said on Perth radio on 25 March 2011, 'Revenue from the mining resource rent tax goes to investment in infrastructure projects, like the Gateway project in Western Australia around the airport.' Then he went on to say, 'If we don't have the revenue from the tax, we can't make the investments.' So the then Treasurer belled the cat. He made it absolutely clear that if you do not raise any money from the mining tax you do not get the projects. So Western Australians need to be aware of the fact that no money from the mining tax meant no Gateway project for Perth, no North West Highway projects. The money was not there. It was not fully funded. The mining tax has failed to deliver the revenue that would enable these projects to be built.                     Yes, but all the former minister did was a sod-turning ceremony. He turns more soil with his shovel than they ever did with bulldozers. The reality is that it is this government that will deliver the Gateway project. It is this government that will deliver the road -

  I do thank the member for Denison for his question and I do appreciate his concern to try to ensure that the agricultural industries of Tasmania are given every possible opportunity to succeed. I entirely share that desire to give the agricultural industries of Tasmania and of our nation every possible opportunity to succeed. That is one of the reasons why we have negotiated a free trade agreement with Korea, to help the great agricultural industries of our country. That is why we are on the high road to an economic partnership agreement with Japan and it is why we are negotiating with China: to try to ensure that farmers right around our great country get a fair go.                 I absolutely accept that industrial hemp, fibre hemp, does have many uses. I absolutely accept that. My understanding is that Food Standards Australia New Zealand is currently looking at this matter again. It will report, as I understand it, by 30 June, and the government will respond at that time.

  I thank the member for Bennelong for his question and recognise his previous experience as a senior business person and as a leading global athlete.                     He was; he was fantastic. He, like many others, recognises how important it is to free the shackles from business and enterprise, remove regulation, reduce the burden of red and green tape and get rid of taxes. As the Prime Minister said a little bit earlier - it is graphic but it is real - today, we have a bonfire of regulation. Fifty thousand pages from the statute books are being brought to an end -                      along with 9Â½ thousand regulations and 1,000 redundant acts of parliament. That is a huge amount. It is a massive burden on business, and the best way to help business is to lift that burden. The best way to help the economy is to free it up to give people the chance to get on with their lives without Canberra telling them how they should behave and what they should do.                 Of course, there is a financial benefit as well. It has already been identified that the FOFA reforms alone will benefit the Australian economy by over $700 million. There is a $90 million one-off implementation save, and $190 million will be saved every year. Those savings alone help to make it easier for business to do its business and simplify the process for consumers.                 The member for McMahon said that this is all a stunt. Getting rid of regulation, according to the Labor Party, is a stunt; it is meaningless. That is because the Labor Party is the best friend of regulation. The Labor Party is the best friend of control over business. The fact is that the Labor Party not only introduced 22,000 new regulations in just five years but they also left behind a burden of 92 announced but never legislated taxation initiatives, which added to the complexity of the taxation system for business. So I say to the Labor Party: do not do the damage in opposition that you did in government; get out of the way and help us to get rid of bad regulation.

  I thank the member for Hinkler. We were up in the member for Hinkler's area not that long ago and had to deal with cane farmers. One of them is spending $135,000 a quarter - over $540,000 a year - on power. One of the major reasons that they are spending that sort of money is because of an issue that is being debated over in the other place at this moment, which is, of course, the carbon tax. It is just like how the member for Blair keeps his people poor. They are trying to keep them poor up in Central Queensland as well. What we are trying to do, obviously, is remove the carbon tax and, by removing the carbon tax, start letting more money go back through the farm gate - back to those families, back to those mums and dads - and put dignity back in these farmers' lives.                 The cane industry is a very important industry. It is one of the major industries in Queensland. Seventy per cent of Australia's sugar canegrowers rely on irrigation to produce a crop, and so much of the time irrigation relies on power. That is the only way you can do it. But what we have seen here -                      Member for Hinkler, those opposite are on a journey, and maybe they are getting there. I will tell you where the journey started. I can remember when Peter Garrett told us that we were going to have six-metre sea rises by 2100. Remember that? I felt like buying a case of beer and going down to Coogee Beach to wait for the show, but it never happened. I read up on Bjorn Lomborg, who said we have had 30 centimetres in the last 150 years, but they are punting on six metres by the end of the century. It is quite spectacular.                 But it does not stop there. The member for Isaacs talked about what was 'routinely called the greatest market failure the world has ever seen'. Treasurer, you would probably be interested in this because, when he was talking about the greatest market failure, I thought - silly me - he was talking about 26 October 1929 when the Great Depression started. I thought he was talking about the Great Depression. But, no -                      Was he talking about 1637 and tulip mania? No. Was he talking about 1720 and the South Sea Bubble? No. Was he talking about 2000 and the dot-com crash? No. He was talking about carbon pricing. How did we miss it?                 Not to be outdone, the then Prime Minister got in on the act and talked about the 'greatest moral challenge of our time'. I thought that it might have been Pol Pot on 17 April 1975, but no. I thought it might have been fascism and the Second World War, but no. I thought it might have been Stalin and the communist gulags, but no. Once more it was carbon pricing. How did we miss it? How did we miss these things? But do not worry, we are continuing the fight right now. We are continuing to fight for it. It is over there in the other place, and the moment that you want a wake up to yourselves and reconnect with Australian people, just tell us about it.

  I am very pleased to get a question from the member for Macarthur about red tape repeal day, because the higher education sector - the university sector - are the big winners from red tape repeal day, from deregulation and from the cutting of reporting requirements and red tape that surrounds the university sector.                 Red tape repeal day next week will have a major impact on the cost base of universities in terms of their interface with government. For example, red tape repeal day, and other decisions that we have already taken in the tertiary education sector in relation to the Australian Research Council or the tertiary education regulator, will see the elimination of unnecessary red tape and reporting requirements that have required universities to tell the government detail about the size, condition, rooms and utilisation of their buildings. We trust universities to know where their buildings are and that they have them and how to utilise them. It will end the duplication of reporting of the same information in different formats for different purposes. Now the government will do that sifting of data themselves rather than requiring universities to report sometimes to six or seven different regulatory agencies exactly the same information but in different formats. There will be a single national database for university reporting, so government departments will coordinate with each other, rather than putting that burden of coordination on the university sector.                 We will abolish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. This is a whole new level of regulation and red tape on the university sector, which the university sector themselves said in their submission to the Commission of Audit. They said:                 The Australian Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission (ACNC) has imposed a new, inefficient and unnecessary layer of regulatory and reporting burden on universities.                 They went on to say:                 Universities are now required to provide detailed annual financial reports to the ACNC, notwithstanding universities are already required to supply such information to at least 6 other Government Departments.                 We are going to abolish that level of regulation and red tape.                 The Australian Research Council has streamlined their guidelines for application, and the tertiary education regulator, TEQSA, has been directed to return to its core business of registering providers and accrediting courses, rather than its thematic, sector-wide investigations into quality, which was never its core business. So it is getting on with its core business and letting universities use their resources to get on with their core business. We are unambiguously students first, unlike the Labor party which has always been for regulation and administration.

  I thank the member for Hume for his question. I note his lifelong interest in business and deregulation and his commitment to the Liberal values, which can be summarised by saying that, 'We believe government's job is to enable citizens to do their best,' -                    The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     whereas, Labor's value is that government always knows best. We are turning the paradigm of government on its head. The previous government, every day, boasted of how many laws they had passed. For the first time, we have a government that is committed to repealing laws, to removing that regulation and red tape. I want to give honourable members some examples in my own portfolio of practical changes being made today that are very important for businesses. For example: at the moment, under the law, every radio station - no matter how small - has to provide audited accounts every year. We have changed the law so that ACMA, the regulator, has the discretion to not require that with smaller stations. Steve Everett of ACE radio in Victoria, which has six stations in that category, says that this will not only reduce his workload but also cut his audit fees in half. These are real practical savings for business. Another example relating to the television industry: at the moment ACMA, the regulator, has no discretion - when a complaint is made, it has to investigate it. A good example: WIN TV in Queensland broadcast an article in 2002 and 2005. There was a complaint about it in 2009 - seven years after the first broadcast and four years after the second. ACMA had no choice - it had to investigate it, and duly found in August 2010 that there had been no breaches.                 That is the sort of red tape that we are removing, and there are many other examples in the telecommunications sector as well. Another key difference between our approach and that of our predecessor is the way we are dealing with industry. My predecessor, Senator Conroy, used to talk to industry leaders one at a time - privately, so he could always tell each one what they wanted to hear. And these episodes of sycophancy - private sycophancy - then of course resulted in collective belligerence when they realised he had told each of them something different.                 What we are doing is dealing with the industry leaders openly. We met with the broadcasting chief executives and the telecom chief executives - dealing with industry openly so the public can see what we are doing and so they know that what we are doing is freeing business to do its job of delivering services more cost-effectively to all Australians.

  Thank you to the member for Barton, in whose electorate I spent some time last week - at the Kogarah RSL, having a round table discussion with childcare providers and services. From the member for Barton's electorate I heard the same things I have been hearing from members on this side of the House for a long time now. We know that the new framework under which the childcare sector operates contains more than 1,000 pages of regulation and more than 1,000 pages of guidelines and is often described by those who have to comply with it as 'overwhelming', 'terrifying', and 'drowning in regulation'.                 The Labor Party always comes back to us with the same line. They say that regulation and red tape keep children safe. Well, I have news for the Labor Party - red tape does not keep children safe. In fact, it may well do the opposite. Every day I speak to educators who say things like this: 'Why did we become educators in the child care system? Because we love children, because we connect with them, we have a bond with them, and we want to care for and nurture them.' What we do not want to do -                      is spend hours and hours of our time filling out reports. For example, if a childcare centre has an assessment it has to produce on demand a report card about a particular child. I am told that takes 22 hours to write. In fact, directors of centres are giving educators extra time to do the paperwork. So, when you meet these wonderful, caring women                     and some men - who nurture the next generation, where are they? Are they on the floor engaging with the children, or reading, or teaching? No, they are locked in the director's office doing the paperwork.                 The member for Barton talked about breaking regulations to open centres, because Labor was so inflexible when it introduced this regime. It said, 'if we do not have the exact ratios complied with for every second of the day, then you cannot stay open'. So, if I am a centre director who gets to work to find one of my preschool teachers called in sick and I cannot find another on short notice, I cannot replace that person with a qualified educator who is not a preschool teacher, but who might still be qualified with an Certificate III in Education. Instead I have to ring the department and get permission to open my centre. This is ridiculous. This is madness. We do not want the wonderful, caring, quality educators who nurture the next generation to have to find another job because they cannot do the thing they love - and the thing they are trained in.                     You can have confidence that the coalition will get this right. We have started work with the state and territory jurisdictions already and we have tranches of red tape removal going through. I look forward to the support of members opposite to actually get this agenda going.

  I want to thank the member for Page, not only for his question but for the outstanding work he does as an advocate for small businesses, family enterprises and farming businesses throughout his electorate. It is great that they have such a strong advocate here.                 We are getting on with the job of creating the right environment, so that businesses in Page and right across Australia can grow and prosper. That is why we keep bringing forward opportunities to cut the red tape that is strangling so many enterprises in this economy. That is why we are seeking to have this parliament support the government's measure to save business $44 million by removing the compulsory pay-clerk burden that is imposed on them under the former government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. That is $44 million of savings for businesses, and for those interested in the not-for-profit community it is a $4 million dollar saving for them as well.                 Not only do we, and the electorate, think that is a good idea, but ACCI surveyed its members and found 84.3 per cent of those businesses either agreed or strongly agreed that the government should not be requiring employers to be the paymaster for the Paid Parental Leave scheme. I would hope that message is getting through to those opposite. We have tried before to get this burden lifted. There has been no credible policy argument about why this cost and compliance imposition need be there. Yet, Labor has rejected those efforts on every occasion. Now we have seen all the state chambers of commerce come out and tell them to get behind what the government is doing. There is a chorus of support across the small business community.                 But what will Labor actually do? Like small business people, I am perpetually optimistic. I am hoping that with 'repeal day' Labor will now come and join with the small businesses in Page and in the wider community to repeal this burden. There is some cause for optimism. Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition said, 'We are committed, in a bipartisan spirit, to the organised and ongoing effort to minimise and simplify, and create cost effective regulation.' Well, I heard the words, but I am particularly unconvinced, and we must see what actually happens.                 Small businesses know that there is a cost to compliance. They know that compliance tasks are not cheap, but will the Leader of the Opposition's words be cheap? We are not sure. The form is not good and it is not encouraging. It was as far back as 2008 that a former small business minister - and yes, there were six of them under Labor - Craig Emerson came out and said Labor was, 'promising to take a giant pair of scissors to red tape that is strangling small business'. He went on to say, 'it has accumulated around the necks of small business for the best part of 20 years'. Well, what did they do? They added 21,000 new or amended regulations. You have seen us fall down the ladder of the government's regulatory impact on business. Let us see if Labor walks the talk. Back this red tape reduction, and then, next, help us repeal the carbon tax. That would be great for the businesses in Page.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I note his deep interest in this issue. I can confirm to the House that, overnight, Russian President Vladimir Putin took action to annex Crimea. Today I announce the Australian government will impose targeted financial sanctions and travel bans against those who have been instrumental in the Russian threat to Ukraine's sovereignty. The actions taken by Russia are a clear violation of international rules prohibiting the use of force and protecting the territorial integrity of states. International law does not allow one state to steal the territory of another on the basis of a referendum that cannot be considered free or fair. The referendum carried out in Crimea on 16 March was not authorised by Ukraine and was carried out while Russian forces were, effectively, in control of the territory. It cannot form the legitimate basis of any alteration to the status of Crimea.                 I condemn in the strongest possible terms the use of violence against Ukraine and its citizens. The situation in Ukraine remains serious, with the potential for military confrontation. The fatal attack on a Ukrainian serviceman in Crimea is to be deplored and underlines the volatility of the crisis that Russia is fuelling.                 Australia has stood with the international community in condemning Russia's actions in Crimea. We joined with 12 other nations in the United Nations Security Council voting on a resolution that declared the referendum could have no validity. No member opposed this resolution, except Russia. Australia's response to Russia's actions is aligned with the action taken by the EU, the United States and Canada, who have also implemented a number of targeted sanctions and travel bans. Measures have been taken in close coordination with our friends and allies, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.                 Overnight, I spoke with foreign secretary William Hague, who acknowledged Australia's support in his speech to the House of Commons last night. I have also spoken with the interim Ukrainian foreign minister. Australia has taken these actions in solidarity and support for a rules based international order. This is in our core national interest to promote peace, stability and security. I reaffirm in unequivocal terms Australia's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity. I continue to urge Russia to abide by its international obligations and behave as a responsible member of the international community. I urge Russia to return to constructive diplomatic dialogue.

  I thank the member for Canning for his question. Those on this side of the House could not be more supportive of strong measures on our borders. But with the member for Canning, I think there is no member in this House on this side who is a stronger supporter of our border protection measures - not just now but over a long period of time.                     The reason for that is he knows - like the Liberals who are running for the Senate in Western Australia, the now Minister for Defence, the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and Linda Reynolds, who has 30 years experience in the ADF, know - the importance of strong border protection measures. They have demonstrated that with their actions. It is the A-team, if you like, of the Western Australian ticket. If you are interested in national security and strong border protection laws, then they are the people you can support in Western Australia in that election.                 Â                  I can report to the member for Canning that we are getting results because we are doing what we said we would do. We went to the election with a strong commitment to put in policies that we knew worked, that did work and that are working again. The result of that is 90 days since we have had a successful people-smuggling venture to this country. It was three months ago, on 19 December last year, when we last saw a successful venture; in the same three-month period 12 months ago, 2,591 people turned up on 47 vessels under the previous government's policies. As a result of this we have been able to establish another 4,000 places in the Special Humanitarian Program to give visas to people who were waiting under their laws and their failures. There are four centres that we have been able to close, and we will be closing more on the mainland because of the success of our policies.                 But there are frustrations - and those frustrations sit opposite. They still want to give permanent visas to the more than 30,000 people who turned up on their watch and still sit here in this country today. That is their policy. Yesterday in the Senate they teamed up with the Greens again and they voted against the restoration of temporary protection visas.                 Some leaders of the opposition are referred to as small targets. This Leader of the Opposition is just small. He is not big enough to rise above his union background, and he is not big enough to let go of the policy failures of the Labor Party when they were in government. He should free himself from the shackles of Labor's policy failures on border protection and he should support the policies of this government that are delivering stronger borders and are stopping the boats.

  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, I did hear the question, yes.                     I thank the member for O'Connor for the question. It is a very important question because it is about health services in Western Australia. The problem is that the Labor Party took money and put it into great big new bureaucracies in Canberra, 12 of them in total, and it really diminished the capacity to help patients that were in need in Western Australia and around the country.                 I have spoken about the GP Super Clinics Program on a couple of occasions now. When you look at the detail of what the member for Sydney claimed to be one of Labor's great successes, it really had many of the same attributes as other Labor Party public policy initiatives. The member for Sydney sits beside the member for McMahon. He was the master behind Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch. Other success stories -                      Just wandered out of the jungle? The war is over! GP superclinics have been a complete failure. You promised 64; in six years you only delivered 27 - but wait to hear about this one at Cockburn.                     The Labor Party presided -                      I would be happy to withdraw. Please allow me then to talk about other policy successes of the Rudd-Gillard years of which the member for Sydney is most proud. The National Rental Affordability Scheme: a great success! The member for Adelaide: a 10 per cent success rate in her program.                     Certainly, Madam Speaker. I am asked about the Cockburn GP superclinic. This was promised in 2009. For those people unacquainted with this program, this was a government program where they put money into setting up clinics which were going to compete with existing GP clinics. The problem with this was, of course -                      It was a $6.65 million program. The first sod was turned two years later in October 2011. It still has not been constructed. Yet $6 million of that money has already been given to the project, but not one patient has been seen. Not one patient has been seen!                 It reminds me of other projects that the Labor Party has been associated with. Look at Centenary House, for arguments sake. It only took 17 months to construct and yet they cannot construct a superclinic within four or five years.

  I thank the member for Parkes for his question. I acknowledge his great representation in this place of that large area of central and western New South Wales.                 Indeed, I have seen the report that the honourable member refers to about public housing built in Moree under the previous Labor government's so-called Nation Building Program. That report indicated that many of these 62 units are actually falling apart. They are falling apart. The foundations are collapsing into the drainage and sewerage systems, windows are cracking - so much so that many of the 62 residents of those new units, funded by the previous Labor government, are having to move away from Moree to towns all over New South Wales because there is insufficient public housing.                 In fact, why did this happen? This happened because -                      This happened because the units were built without council approval in Moree's notoriously shifty black soil. That is why it occurred. What the mayor of the local council had to say about it was:                 _ we fought like mad to stop it. We had no say in their design or construction. Normally council has to check all footings and the depth of concrete ... we were disturbed with the designs we saw but they just pushed us to the side.                 It was the worst arrogance we've ever seen.                 I was wondering, given that this was funded by the previous Labor government, who might have been responsible?                     Of course they have six choices because they had six ministers responsible for housing under the previous Labor government. But I will give you a hint - this one over here! Yes, you would be right if you said it was the hapless member for Sydney!                     What we find is not only her incompetent administration of the GP Super Clinics -                      and her incompetent administration of the NRAS program but now her incompetent administration of the public housing program -                      I tell you what, it is just as well she was not in charge of the immigration program.                     The reality is -                      The reality is, millions of dollars have been wasted. These units are falling apart. Millions of dollars will probably have to be spent to refix them. Just another Labor mess!

  I thank the member for Berowra for his question, and I note his deep and enduring interest in matters relating to the Middle East.                 The Australian government deplores the violence and suffering that is occurring in Syria. We note the tragic loss of over 130,000 lives in this conflict. We support international efforts to find common ground for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.                 We are seriously concerned by reports that Australians have travelled to the Levant region to actively support or participate in fighting in Syria. Australia has put in place an arms embargo, therefore it is illegal for any Australian citizen or any dual citizen to engage in fighting for either side in Syria and it is illegal for them to fund, train or recruit someone else to fight, or to supply weapons to either side. Australia has also prescribed the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as terrorist organisations under our Criminal Code listing regime.                  We are concerned about the radicalisation of Australians as a result of the Syrian conflict, particularly those who travel to Syria and return to Australia with capabilities acquired through fighting or training with extremist groups. I am aware of reports of the death of an Australian ADF member in Syria. I can inform the House that the individual was not a serving ADF member. The individual joined the Australian Army in February 2009 and was discharged in September 2010, following around three months absence without leave. He held the rank of sapper and had basic engineering training.                 We do remain deeply concerned for the safety of Australians in Syria. The security situation is extremely dangerous, with ongoing military conflict, kidnapping and terrorist attacks. We will continue to review the cancellation of passports to prevent breaches of the arms embargo. Foreign ministers current and former have exercised their discretionary power under the Australian Passports Act to cancel passports.                  I also remind the House that Australia co-authored UN Security Council resolution 2139 on the humanitarian situation in Syria. This was supported by all members of the Security Council. In addition, Australia has provided around $111 million in humanitarian assistance. We have also provided $2 million to assist with the work on the elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.

  I am aware that, this day, members opposite's colleagues in the Senate, and the Greens, have voted to keep the carbon tax. That is what they have done. They have voted to keep the carbon tax that they told the Australian people before the last election they had terminated. They said before the last election that they had terminated the carbon tax and yet today they voted in the Senate to keep that selfsame carbon tax. All of us would remember the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, running around the countryside saying the carbon tax was terminated. Hundreds of thousands of Australians got these brochures saying that the carbon tax -                      I am very happy to read from this document: 'Kevin Rudd and Labor removed the carbon tax'. Well, the carbon tax was so removed that they supported it - they voted to keep it in the Senate earlier today. But it is not just the deception pre the election; the deception continues to this very moment. Remember, Madam Speaker, just an hour or so ago, members opposite - the Labor Party - voted in the Senate to keep the carbon tax. This would come as a shock to the people of Western Australia who opened up their West Australian newspaper this morning, 20 March. What do they read? Answers from Joe Bullock, who I understand is the Labor Party Senate candidate: 'Labor is scrapping the carbon tax.' Well, they are so scrapping the carbon tax that they voted today in the Senate to keep the carbon tax.                 The truth is you just cannot trust members opposite to tell the truth and you cannot trust them anywhere near an economy. The carbon tax is an act of economic vandalism that this government will remove and that members opposite will keep defending while there is political breath in their bodies because, whatever they say to the people, when it comes to this parliament they support the Greens. The unholy alliance between the Labor Party and the Greens: it is disowned in public but it is adhered to in this parliament. We are keeping our commitments and the Labor Party cannot help themselves - they are breaking theirs.

  I am happy to have question after question on this subject from the Leader of the Opposition.                     I am happy to have question after question on this subject from the Leader of the Opposition, because what is on display in the parliament today is the difference between -                      this government and its predecessor. When these sorts of issues arose -                      When issues of this nature arise, this government does the right and the honourable thing, as Senator Sinodinos did yesterday. He did the right and the honourable thing. That is not just my judgement. It is also the judgement of Kelvin Thomson - I cannot remember his seat -                      The member for Wills. But it is also the judgement of the member for Wills.                     Plainly, Senator Sinodinos has done the right and the honourable thing, and that is not just my judgement but also that is the judgement of the member for Wills, who said this morning at the doors, 'Stepping aside in the face of an inquiry like the ICAC inquiry is the right thing to do'. And he added - good on the member for Wills - 'And there is plenty of precedent for it'. Not too much precedent on that side of the House, I hasten to add.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question and I appreciate his concern. I appreciate the concerns of many members of this House, such as the member for Dawson sitting in front of him. I appreciate the concerns of all members on this side of the chamber and, indeed, people on the crossbench, like the member for Kennedy.                 I appreciate his concern, and our concern, to try to ensure that the workers of Mount Isa continue to have jobs - to try to ensure that those mines and plants in Mount Isa continue to operate. I do share the member's concern to try to ensure that nothing is done by government to make that harder and that whatever possible to make that easier is done by government. The best thing we could do in this House right now, and in the Senate right now, to help reduce the price of power is pass the carbon tax repeal legislation - get rid of the carbon tax. Even on the members opposite's own figures that would reduce the price of power by 10 per cent. That would be a material benefit not just for every household in our country, which would be $550 a year better off; but it would also be a material benefit to the industries of places like Mount Isa.                 I do appreciate the question from the member for Kennedy. There is a measure before the parliament right now - right now - that could help the workers of Mount Isa, and that is scrapping the carbon tax. It is long overdue and members opposite should stop misleading the Australian public on this matter. They should stop saying one thing in Perth and doing the opposite here in Canberra. They should start to tell the Australian people the truth and they should start acting with honour to help the workers and the households of our country.

  I am coming to you. I will get there. I thank the member for Moore for the question. I recognise that he believes that what you say before the election should be consistent with what you say after the election. Today we have heard that the Labor Party said in Western Australia this morning before the Senate election that they were opposed to the carbon tax and today they voted to keep the carbon tax. That should come as no surprise. Before the 2010 election they said there would be no carbon tax and after the 2010 election they introduced, in partnership with the Greens, the carbon tax.                     The Leader of the Opposition goes to Perth and says, 'No, we don't like that mining tax,' then comes back here and votes to keep the mining tax. So consistency is not an endearing principle for the Labor Party. When it comes to the budget it is vitally important that you be consistent. Of course the Labor Party, after having delivered some of the biggest budget deficits in Australian history, have left behind the fastest growth in government spending of any economy in the top 17 of the IMF - what a great legacy that is from Labor! What is more, they were so concerned before the election about the state of the budget that the old, well-tanned member for Lilley said before the last election that the Labor Party was introducing a $1.1 billion saving in relation to R&amp;D for companies with a turnover of more than $20 billion. They said they were introducing that saving because it was a down payment on the repair that the budget needs.                 Well, he would know. He created the problem. He was so outraged about the problem he actually suggested that they have part of a solution - a $1.1 billion change to R&amp;D. The problem is that they never legislated it. They announced it, but never legislated it. So we come in here and say: 'Yes, we agree with you, Labor. You screwed up the budget. We have a collective interest to try to fix it.' But the Labor Party now say that they are so concerned about the budget deficit that they now are going to vote in the Senate against the savings they announced on R&amp;D before the election. What are you thinking? What could you over there be possibly thinking? Before the election you say one thing and after the election you say other things. You are inconsistent.                     The only consistency from Labor before an election and after an election is the partnership with the Greens. That is the consistent theme all the way along.

  I thank the member for Cowan for the question. He cares about the economy, and that is why he asked a question on the economy.                     He is absolutely right because the mining tax represents a huge sovereign risk impost on the Australian economy. Western Australia exported $83 billion of resources last year. The carbon tax and the mining tax have a very real negative impact on the people of Western Australia. The coalition are absolutely determined to get rid of the carbon tax. We said that before the election and we mean to do it after the election, and we are trying to do it after the election. We are entirely consistent. With the mining tax, we said before the election we wanted to get rid of it. So we are trying to get rid of it after the election. The problem is the Labor Party are being inconsistent. The only consistent thing about the Labor Party is their partnership with the Greens. They keep saying to the Australian people, 'We're two different parties.' I went back to my little book.                     I know what a prop is. This is no prop. We have played prop; this is not a prop.                     This is fantastic. This is Chris Bowen's Hearts and Minds: A Blueprint for Modern Labor. As I said, the only consistent thing from the Labor Party is its partnership with the Greens. So I quote from the book:                 Labor and the Greens are not different shades on the same continuum; we are different parties that believe in different things. People need to be very clear in their understanding: if you vote Labor, you will not get Greens policies.                 I want to pay tribute to the member for Perth. I want to pay tribute to the member for Perth, the shadow parliamentary secretary for Western Australia. She said today, 'I think there is a perception that the mining tax was not a good tax for Western Australia. I think that is true.' Come over, come over to the coalition. We might just have you on this side. Come over, come over to the coalition, because at least there is one person in the Labor Party who is prepared to be fair dinkum with the people of Western Australia - except the problem is that the Labor Party and the Greens work against the interests of the people of Western Australia, and no-one does that more than the member for Perth.                     This belongs to the Parliamentary Library. If I table it, I may be in danger of doubling its distribution.

  I can confirm to the member for Fisher that both these incidents did occur. Both these incidents referred to by the member for Fisher are obviously very unfortunate ones.                      The member for Grayndler thinks it is hilarious, apparently. He thinks it is hilarious that Andrew Zaf was stabbed -                      in his home and hit with a piece of wood last weekend.                   The member for                    Grayndler                    then left the chamber.                     So that it is on the record, I withdraw, if the member for Grayndler is offended. But the fact remains -                      I withdraw unreservedly.                     I am happy to withdraw unreservedly -                      My advice to the opposition would be that when someone is discussing the stabbing -                      of a whistleblower, general laughter in the chamber and from particular people can be misinterpreted.                   The member for                    Parramatta                    then left the chamber.                     I was reporting that Andrew Zaf, a whistleblower who has exposed union corruption, was stabbed on the weekend outside his home and that Joe McDonald, the assistant secretary of the CFMEU in Western Australia, has been banned from Multiplex sites in Western Australia for three years - one of the reasons for which, reported in The West Australian, was that he put a particular worker in a headlock and threatened to hit him. Now, both of these incidents highlight why it is important for the government's legislative agenda to be agreed to by the Senate, rather than be blocked by the opposition. Both of these incidents show why union thuggery and corruption need to be stamped out in Australia. They show why the government's Australian Building and Construction Commission legislation should be passed in the Senate, not blocked by the Leader of the Opposition. They show why the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill, which sits in the Senate, should be passed by the Labor Party rather than be blocked in the Senate. They show why the proposed royal commission to be headed by Dyson Hayden should be supported by the opposition rather than opposed at the time.                  The government is taking firm action. We are introducing the Australian Building and Construction Commission, the Registered Organisations Commission and a royal commission. The Leader of the Opposition's response has been to say that bikie members who turn up to work sites should not wear their colours. We think a much firmer response is required. We want to put a tough industrial cop on the beat, not the fashion police on the beat. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he is a union leader protecting the union leaders. He is running a protection racket for a protection racket and he needs to rise above his background.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I well remember the broadband forums in his electorate and how concerned his constituents were about the availability of wireless services. We have seen some very interesting examples of Conrovianism in the rollout of the NBN. We have seen the claim where thousands of premises have been passed with fibre, but where no connection could be made.                     Conrovianism is absolutely at the centre of this multibillion dollar bungle - that is the heart and soul of the problem. I have mentioned the way in which the fixed rollout had been misleading. I have mentioned the satellite - how a quarter of a million people were told that they were eligible for the satellite, where slots were purchased to cater for only 48,000 and now they can only get dial-up. But, with the NBN's fixed wireless rollout in Western Australia, Conrovianism entered into a new surreal stage, hitherto unrecognised for its immenseness, its bizarre nature. Think about this: there are 51 fixed wireless locations on the NBN plan around Perth -                      including in the honourable member's electorate - covering Kelmscott, Carinyah, Armadale, Byford and Serpentine - for which the NBN had no spectrum whatsoever. Those towers, if built, could not transmit anything. What could they be used for? Were they perches for carrier pigeons to use? Seriously, with the latest developments in Conrovian science, was there to be found a new part of the electromagnetic spectrum, perhaps consisting of the magnetic personality of the former minister? Could charisma and charm make up the difference? Was that enough to deliver a service? There are 16,000 premises on the outskirts of Perth - to the north, the east and the south - where 51 wireless base stations were planned, with no capacity whatsoever to send or receive. The NBN Co set out to the Australian people a wireless plan for which, for at least a quarter of the footprint, we believe, they had no capacity at all to deliver. This is Conrovianism at its most surreal.

  I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. Member for O'Connor, correct me if I am wrong: you are a fourth-generation farmer, and O'Connor, being a seat 9,008 square kilometres, is the third-largest seat in Australia. It is also extremely important that the people in that area who are in the live sheep trade and in the live cattle trade understand that we are taking fundamental steps towards getting more money back to the mums and dads and back to the kitchen tables of O'Connor and Durack, and to all the people across Australia, by opening up the trade again. The Labor Party today might not have scrapped the carbon tax, but in the past they did scrap the live cattle trade. Remember that they could scrap the live cattle trade; they could do that. They are very good at stopping things. It is important to understand that as we open up the trade into Egypt we are giving more opportunity, more market space and more potential for more money to come back to the good people of Western Australia. I can see a whole range of Western Australians here who are going to be standing behind their candidates at the Senate election reminding them that it is the coalition that stands behind the live cattle trade and got it going again.                  It is also important that we understand something else - today the Labor Party and the Greens, who are back together joined at the hip, have decided that from 1 July the people of O'Connor and Durack are going to have to start paying the carbon tax on diesel. That equates to 7c a litre on diesel. If someone picks up a truck at Warburton and goes down to Mount Barker, around 1,660 kilometres, that person is going to be paying the carbon tax because of the people in the Senate who apparently can change the temperature of the globe single-handedly. We will have to see how they are going, because they have reinvested in the carbon tax. Bucko, go outside and check out how the weather is going - because they can change it! If they can change the weather, why don't they make it rain!                  It is good to see that Labor has put itself back on the hook - back with the Greens and back with the carbon tax. The member for Blair is back to tell his meat workers that he believes he can change the temperature of the globe. It is all there. We thought they had got rid of their previous Prime Minister. But, no, she is back. They are back. They are back where they belong - back with the carbon tax!

  Let me stress that Senator Sinodinos has done the right and honourable thing by stepping aside.                     I will tell members opposite what they need to understand, which is that Senator Sinodinos has done the right and honourable thing.                   The member for Watson then left the cha                   mber.                     For the period for which Senator Sinodinos stands aside, he will be allocated a backbench senator's office in the Senate wing, he will not receive his ministerial salary and his staff will be directed to work for the person acting in his stead, namely the Minister for Finance.

  I thank the member for Tangney for his question and I thank him for his campaign to vote 1 for the Liberal Senate team at the election on 5 April. The coalition's foreign policy is designed in part to project and protect Australia's reputation as an open, export-oriented market economy. At the heart of our foreign policy is economic diplomacy. Just as the aim of traditional diplomacy was peace, the aim of economic diplomacy is peace and prosperity.                 The Australian government is working hard to find new markets for our exporters and is promoting Australia as an attractive place to do business and an attractive place to invest. That is why the Treasurer and the team on this side of the House are putting the government's finances back in order. That is why we are restoring our reputation as good financial managers. That is why we are cutting the unnecessary red tape and regulations imposed by Labor. That is why we are streamlining approvals for projects. That is why we are lifting the dead weight imposed by the carbon tax and the mining tax, which affects our international competitiveness. It is important for Western Australia, as the member knows, because the mining sector is vital to our overall economy - it is worth about $114 billion, it employs about 100,000 Western Australians directly and hundreds of thousands more Western Australians indirectly.                  Policy consistency is also vital. From day one the coalition has opposed the mining tax as being bad for Western Australia, bad for the Australian economy and bad for jobs. The Labor Party, in government and in opposition, is all over the shop. The member for Perth, when she was a candidate in 2010, was saddened, apparently, by Labor's failure to promote the mining tax. She said:                 I would have loved to have gone out and sold it. But the central command had the view that this was something you're not allowed to talk about and I just think that's crazy.                 Well, member for Perth, here is your moment. The member for Perth, the shadow parliamentary secretary for Western Australia, can go out each and every day -                      The shadow parliamentary secretary for Western Australia has her chance to sell this mining tax that she loves so much, the tax that, back in 2010, she wanted to sell to the Western Australian people. Now, as a member of parliament, she says the ALP should change its mining tax policy. 'Yesterday, Western Australian Labor MP,' according to the ABC news, 'said that the opposition should go back to the drawing board on the mining tax.' She is clearly sipping from the same cup of policy courage as the Leader of the Opposition: say one thing in Western Australia and another in Canberra.                      But leading the charge is the No. 1 ticket-holder for the Labor Party, Joe Bullock -                      But leading the charge is Joe Bullock. When asked to say something negative about Tony Abbott, he could not. He has a list for the Leader of the Opposition, though -

  The Leader of the Opposition is desperate to insinuate that there has been some wrongdoing here. Let me repeat for his benefit - and I know it is difficult for members opposite to appreciate - that Senator Sinodinos has done the right and the honourable thing.                      I have here a letter from Senator Sinodinos to the Special Minister of State -                    The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     indicating that he will forgo his ministerial entitlements. I table this letter. I have a letter from Senator Sinodinos to the Secretary of the Treasury, saying that his staff will be working to Senator Cormann. I table the letter. I have here a letter from Senator Sinodinos to the President of the Senate saying that he will not be drawing his salary. So he will not get his salary, he will not get his entitlements and he does not have his staff.

  I thank the member for Durack for his question. We had a terrific couple of days up in the Pilbara earlier this year looking at the importance of the mining industry. It is terrific to have the new member for Durack, like the previous member for Durack, so committed to making the most out of Australia's mining industry and not committed to finding ways to injure it, like the former Treasurer, the member for Lilley. While we were there, we committed, along with the Minister for Finance, to ensure that the funding went ahead for two very important projects in Western Australia: the Great Northern Highway project and the North West Coastal project, two projects that were left unfunded by the Labor Party when we got to government. We know they were unfunded, because they were being paid for by the mining tax revenue.                     The member for Perth knows very well that this was a problem that they had left to the new government. We got to government, and the infrastructure Prime Minister said, 'This is unacceptable; these two projects must go ahead.' So we found a way to fund these projects.                 We know that there was no money there because we referred to the oracle himself - the designer of the mining tax and the genius behind the tax that raised no revenue - the member for Lilley, the former Treasurer. He said on radio in Perth in 2011:                 If we don't have the revenue from the tax then we can't make the investments.                 So there was no revenue and no money, and there were no projects.                 In fact, it was not just the member for Lilley, the former Treasurer, but also the member for Grayndler, who, unfortunately, is not here to hear this. When he was the infrastructure minister in this place in 2011, he answered a question in this place from the member for Throsby about the importance of the mining tax and said:                 But they are only possible if you have revenue from somewhere -                  the mining tax. The issue here is that there was no revenue from the mining tax when we got to government. There were no projects that would have gone ahead, so we have funded them and are actually pushing the Western Australian government to get it done quicker.                     I know it burns the member for Perth up!                     She left such a legacy up in Karratha that they remember the member for Perth up there; they remember you well and truly up there! So these projects that will raise productivity -                      They are very excited today, Madam Speaker; there is something in the water over there?                 These are projects which will ensure that we get higher productivity, more jobs and a better and stronger Australia. They will be delivered -                      But what would make them easier to deliver is getting rid of the mining tax - getting away from the Greens and backing the coalition to get rid of the mining tax. That is what the Australian people voted for on 7 September. We will keep delivering infrastructure and we will have the infrastructure Prime Minister stand there proudly and deliver it for Australia.

  As just about every member of this House knows, including members opposite, Senator Sinodinos is a fundamentally decent man. He is an extremely competent man. He was an absolutely worthy and appropriate appointment to the incoming ministry, and I have to say his actions yesterday entirely vindicate his decency and his honour.

  I congratulate Dr Gillespie, the member for Lyne, on a lifetime of service to medicine and patients in his local community. He is very keen to see additional health services delivered into the electorate of Lyne, but, of course, it is made more difficult because Labor wasted billions of dollars. They set up what they claimed at the time to be the signature health policy of the Rudd-Gillard years - the so-called GP superclinics. That saw $650 million of borrowed money going into a program, including this one at Port Macquarie, but the problem is that not many patients have been seen.                 I thought we were running out of examples of the success of the GP superclinic, but this one at Port Macquarie is pretty special! It is pretty special because the taxpayers of Australia have paid $5.6 million to this particular superclinic in Port Macquarie that was promised in 2010, but not a single patient has been seen at this clinic. So people rightly had an expectation that, when the Labor Party promised that a clinic would be set up, doctors would actually be employed and that patients would be seen.                 I do not think it gets much more basic than that.                     People who build a house pay progress payments to the builder and pay a payment on completion. The problem is that Labor gave all of the money up-front. They devised some great schemes. As we know, the member for Sydney - who is now looking through press clips and all sorts of other issues but not concentrating on this area - after the success of the superclinic program, moved on to the housing affordability scheme that put money into housing that ended up sinking into the earth.                     I welcome that interjection from the member for Ballarat, because, let me assure you, these promises from Labor have been coming since 2007. The original proposal from Labor was that these superclinics would be set up and that people would be diverted away from emergency departments, but quickly they retreated from that statement because there has not been one shred of evidence in the last six years that any patient has been diverted away from an emergency department. At the same time, the Labor Party created 12 great big new health bureaucracies in Canberra. There are now 21 bureaucracies in addition to the Department of Health - and we do not run a single hospital. We do not employ a doctor, a nurse or a pharmacist that sees a patient. Yet Labor diverted money away from these communities into these bureaucracies in Canberra. It is an absolute disgrace. I can tell you one thing: this government will not make the same mistakes that Labor did. We will put money back into frontline services and we will clean up Labor's mess in health.

  I do thank the member for O'Connor for his question. If you are serious about helping families, you have got to be serious about cutting taxes. Cutting taxes and reforming taxes start with scrapping the carbon tax and scrapping the mining tax, which are anti Western Australian taxes. This government is serious about scrapping the carbon tax, so serious that legislation to scrap the carbon tax was the first item of legislation introduced into this parliament. Every day this government gets on with the job of scrapping the carbon tax.                 The carbon tax is a piece of economic vandalism. That is what it is. It is a piece of economic vandalism which costs the families, the households of this country $550 a year - that is, $550 a year that the Leader of the Opposition wants families and households to keep paying. But it does not just cost families $550 a year. Over time, it will strip $1 trillion out of Australia's cumulative GDP; it will cut iron production by 20 per cent; it will cut aluminium production by over 60 per cent; and the gross national income per head - the money that each of us get every year - will be almost $5,000 a year less with a carbon tax than without one. That is why we will always strive and we will not rest until this carbon tax is gone.                 The carbon tax is an anti Western Australian tax because Western Australia is Australia's energy capital. The mining tax is an anti Western Australian tax because Western Australia is the iron ore capital of this country. Everyone knows that these are bad taxes, even the Leader of the Opposition knows that the mining tax is a bad tax. That is why every time he is asked about it in Western Australia, he is reduced to bumbling incoherence. The Leader of the Opposition knows that the carbon tax is a bad tax and that is why before the election he promised to terminate it.                 But it just gets worse. Last Thursday in TheWest Australian Labor candidates were saying that they are scrapping the carbon tax. On the very day Labor is saying it is scrapping the carbon tax in Perth, it is voting for it in Canberra. You cannot trust members opposite anywhere near an economy and you cannot trust this Leader of the Opposition with the truth.

  We will release the Commission of Audit report once we have the final report and once we have fully considered it. There is nothing wrong with this because when the former government got the Gonski review, it considered it for at least two months. When the former government got the tax review from Ken Henry, it considered for over four months. This is some so unobjectionable that when the frontbencher, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Penny Wong, was asked about this, she said, ' I think we put it out was it three or four months later? I can't recall, I wasn't - ' and David Speers says of the Henry review, Why did you sit on it that long?' And Penny Wong says, 'Probably because we were considering it.'                 We will carefully consider the Commission of Audit report as an adult government would do. When we have carefully considered the report, we will publish it.

  It is a very good question, and it is no surprise that it comes from a Western Australian who went to the last election advocating the repeal of the carbon tax and the mining tax, because it is in the best interests of the people of Western Australia to get rid of those taxes. The member for Durack is not the only person I listen to carefully from Western Australia. I have been thinking carefully about the member for Perth over there, who has just had a meteoric rise; she is now not just a spokesperson for Perth but for the Labor Party in the whole of Western Australia. I reflected carefully on her words last week when she said, 'I think it would be fair to say the mining tax has not done the job that it was designed to do.'                     That's what I think. It was not doing the job it was designed to do.                     So I went back to the original version of the mining tax and found out that the original version next year was meant to raise $12Â½ billion in one year. Then of course in the 2010 election it was reduced down to $6Â½ billion. Then, in the old member for Lilley's second-last budget, he halved it to $3.2 billion and then he reduced it in his last budget to $1 billion. Then, just before the election, Labor said: 'Don't worry. It will raise somewhere between $300 million and $800 million.' But, all the time, this tax has $16 billion of expenditure against it.                  And they are not very good with maths. They usually promote the people who are the worst at maths, so I think the member for Perth has a meteoric rise ahead of her, because she said, only on the weekend, when asked about how much the mining tax is raising, 'Well, I think we are getting, I think, sort of around $300,000, $500,000, $500 million a year. So it is not an extreme tax.' Who would have done this transcript? The office of the member for McMahon apparently typed up the transcript. But it gets better. She said, 'Look, the companies that paid the tax - BHP, Rio, FMG - they have all recorded record profits.' The only problem is: two of those three companies have said they are not paying any of the tax. Rio said in a report to this parliament that they put it to the exchange; they are not paying any mining tax. FMG said they are not paying any mining tax. The member for Perth is on a meteoric rise. You could be the Leader of the Opposition within 12 months.                     The best numeracy skills in the entire Labor Party rest in the member for Perth and her seat.                     The bottom line is: this is a tax that is bad for Western Australia. The fact is that, if the Labor Party does not understand the tax, then the Western Australians will not buy it.

  If members opposite were serious about creating and protecting jobs, they would be joining the government in scrapping the carbon tax and the mining tax. That is what they would be doing. They would be joining this government in scrapping these job-destroying, anti Western Australian taxes. That is what they would be doing.                     The insinuations in the Leader of the Opposition's question are simply false, as a statement released by the Department of Employment today makes absolutely crystal clear. I tender the statement from the Department of Employment.

  It is a hugely important issue. The Labor Party have left a legacy of debt and deficit on a scale that Australia has not seen for some period of time; the deficit being $123 billion in accumulated deficits over the next four years, and $667 billion in debt if remedial action is not taken.                      The IMF recently found that, in the six years from 2012 to 2018, Australia's real expenditure growth is forecast to rise by nearly 16Â½ per cent, which is twice the average of the rest of the IMF and double the IMF 17 advanced economies. So Labor has locked-in expenditure growth higher than any other of the top 17 nations in the IMF.                  On the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition asked the question at the launch of the Western Australian Senate campaign: 'Do we give power to those who seek to whittle away our standard of living?' It is really a rhetorical question, because, as Dr David Gruen illustrated in a number of speeches - and as you can see on this graph - Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, under Labor there is actually a significant drop in the standard of living.                     I will table it.                     Dr David Gruen also identified that, if current trends continue, Australia would need to have the very best productivity growth it has had in 60 years just to maintain our standard of living. Just to maintain our standard of living we need to break every productivity record as a result of what Labor left behind - and that comes from the deputy secretary of the Treasury, which I also table.                 The bottom line here is that if we are to maintain our standard of living as a nation we have to fix the budget and we have to undertake the reform that Labor avoided. In fact, recklessly, they spent more money than they were ever going to collect. This is a challenge for Australia; it is not just for this government. Whoever is elected has to do the hard yards, and it starts in the May budget. That is not the end of the story; it starts then. It is going to take years to climb this mountain, but we in the coalition are absolutely determined to climb the mountain.                     We are determined that we will not leave Australians with a lesser quality of life than that which we have inherited because of the largesse of Labor.

  I am not going to quote the exact date that we started the Commonwealth Grants Commission, but quite obviously there has been a formula in place for more than half a century in relation to the distribution of funds. It primarily came out of events around the early part of the 20th century when the Commonwealth increased its taxation powers and then distributed money back to the states. For most of the period since the original grants commission formula started, Western Australia was a recipient state. In fact, it was a recipient state at various times in the last two decades.                 Western Australia has done so well - of which we should all be proud. It is a great story about enterprise. It is a great story about innovation. It is a great story about being able to harness the resources available to the people of the state and of the nation for the benefit of the people of the state and the nation. That is what Western Australians have done, and they have done it incredibly successfully. In the latest redistribution - which I will release after we meet with the treasurers in the next couple of weeks - Western Australia actually does better than it was expecting. It is a significant improvement on the state budget, and Western Australians should be celebrating that.                 Ultimately, when it comes down to the distribution of money, if, in your own determination, you are going to give one state more money, you have to take it off another state. I would invite the honourable member to identify which states he would like to take the money off. Would it be Queensland? Would he like to reduce the GST allocation to Queensland to improve the GST allocation to Western Australia? Or would it be Victoria or another state? There is a pool and there is an independent commission that determines how it is allocated. Western Australia is actually the beneficiary this year of that distribution. But, ultimately, these are issues that are left in the hands of the independent commission.

  I particularly want to thank the member for Forrest, because Western Australian firms have been hit by the carbon tax and are being hit by the carbon tax. In particular, let us begin with this: a $627 million hit last year alone on Western Australian firms, with $344 million of that on electricity, $182 million of that on mining and manufacturing and $94 million of that as a hit to gas. The example was given of BHP Billiton Worsley Alumina. That is a $56 million hit on that operation. Other examples are: Yara Pilbara Fertilisers, $35 million; Pilbara Iron, $16 million; CSBP Fertilisers, $14 million; and Murrin Murrin nickel, $11 million. Those examples continue right throughout operations across Western Australia.                 But of course the question asked was whether or not the tax was likely to be extended. As honourable members would know, 75,000 firms in Australia are already hit not just by the carbon tax but also by the off-road diesel fuel component of the carbon tax. That could be in warehousing, cool stores and all manner of businesses - small and large. But let us remember this, because the Leader of the Opposition has been wonderfully silent since the election: their policy was and continues to be to increase and to extend the reach of the carbon tax. Their policy was and continues to be to add the carbon tax to on-road diesel from 1 July this year.                 Today is your chance, I say to the Leader of the Opposition. Will you now rule out, in any form - whether it is in this House or outside of this House, whether it is in a press conference or actually when you go to the people of WA - that the Labor Party's policy continues to be to extend the carbon tax to on-road diesel? It is a very simple test. You can run but you cannot hide. The policy is to extend the carbon tax to on-road diesel. Between now and the Western Australian Senate vote, here is the chance for the Western Australian people to know: does the Labor Party want to extend the carbon tax? Is it still its policy to extend the carbon tax to on-road diesel? Somewhere, sometime, that question has to be answered, because at this moment it is the policy, and if it is not the policy and if you are walking away from the carbon tax, everybody deserves to know. So, right now, we have a $627 million hit. We have 75,000 firms around Australia being hit by the off-road diesel. But it is the Leader of the Opposition's plan to extend that diesel tax -

  Well, there was no mistake. But I have found a mistake, because the member for McMahon said that there was a $5.7 billion mistake, and you remember that I said, 'Where did you get that from?' and he said 'Michael Pascoe,' and so on. And I said, 'You should go back to Swanny.' Well, that afternoon the member for Lilley tweeted that there was a $54 billion mistake.                     You've hit me! That is brutal!

  I thank the member for Swan for his question. He, of all the people in this House, knows how important it is for small business to run at a profit. He was a small business man himself, unlike most of those over there, who have never been in business and never employed anyone, and he certainly understands -                      I am happy to do a poll on the other side any time you like. I know the member for Hunter was an auto-electrician, but they are pretty short on business people over that side.                 I know that the member for Swan understands how small business works and understands that, for the 21,000 small businesses in his electorate, it is important that they are able to continue to service the mining industry. The mining industry in Western Australia is an enormous employer. Nationally, it employs around 270,000 people, and in total around 800,000 people rely on the mining industry in some way for their income. Western Australia is the mining state in Australia. I do not like to acknowledge that, as a Queenslander, but it is the mining state - at the moment; we will catch them again.                 But what do those on the other side think of a state that excels in something like the mining industry? They think: 'Let's tax it. Let's just tax it. Let's not care that they underpin the economy and that the mining industry is the backbone of the economy in Western Australia; let's just tax it. Let's introduce it.' I join with the Treasurer: only the member for Lilley could design a tax that costs nearly $40 million - $30 million to implement and then another $10 million a year. Only the member for Lilley could design a tax that does not collect any money. Only the member for Lilley could design a tax that not only disadvantages every business in Western Australia but fails to -                      The member for Perth interjects, and we know the member for Perth's view on this tax. She wants to get rid of it. She has not got the courage to say it here, but she says it over there in Western Australia, like the Leader of the Opposition. In Western Australia he wants to get rid of the tax; in the House he opposes it.                 We need to make sure that the mining industry in Western Australia pays its fair share of tax. The mining industry pays around $20 billion a year in company tax and since 2006-07 has paid around $117 billion in company tax and royalties. The Labor Party is not happy with that. It would rather design a tax that does not work and further dents the confidence of investors in that industry. If those on that side are serious about jobs, particularly jobs in Western Australia, they should join us in getting rid of the mining tax.

  I thank the member for his question. He knows full well how important infrastructure development is, especially for states like Western Australia. Fortunately, so does the Prime Minister, who announced today the establishment of a new high-level cabinet committee which will oversight infrastructure development in Australia and introduce greater coordination and accountability and make sure these projects actually happen.                   The member for Perth then left the chamber.                     The committee demonstrates our commitment as a government to make sure that infrastructure investment in Australia delivers projects that are worthwhile, right across the nation. Once more, they will be projects that are fully costed, fully budgeted and fully funded. We know that you have got to have real money if you want to build real projects. That contrasts a bit with the member for Grayndler, who said in the parliament last week:                 Infrastructure development also requires imagination and creativity. If you can imagine the future, you can assemble the building blocks to deliver your vision. That is the Labor way.                 The problem for Labor was that they tried to use imaginary money to build their projects! The money was not really there. It was coming from a mining tax that did not really raise any money and from a carbon tax that did not raise any money. It was imaginary money! I am sorry, but you cannot build projects, no matter how visionary they might be, if you are using imaginary money - it has got to be the real thing. This government has a plan in place to build real projects with real money.                 In the same speech the member for Grayndler said another thing with which I agree:                 Now that the coalition is back in government it has inherited a Labor legacy_                 That is right. A Labor legacy of debt: $123 billion in deficit over the next four years. We have a program to build real projects in Western Australia: $686 million for the Gateway WA project in Perth, a project that Labor intended to build using the proceeds of the mining tax; $615 million for the Swan Valley -                      I have just pointed out how a real program that will deliver real projects is different from the imaginary program designed by the Labor Party. We will go onto the $140 million for the Tonkin Highway, $307 million for the Great Northern Highway and $174 million for the North West Coastal Highway - those last two projects Labor intended to fund out of imaginary money from the mining tax. We will deliver real projects with real money.                 Leave not granted.

  Of course, this government is determined to try to ensure that Australia remains a free, fair and tolerant society where bigotry and racism have no place. But we also want this country to be a nation where freedom of speech is enjoyed.                     Sometimes free speech will be speech which upsets people and which offends people. It is in the nature of free speech that sometimes some people will not like it. I do not like what members opposite say quite a lot, but I fully accept their right to say it.                     Madam Speaker, our freedom and our democracy fundamentally depend upon the right to free speech. Sometimes free speech is something the people who listen to it do not like. That is the truth. This government will do exactly what we said we would do, pre-election. We will do in government exactly what we committed to in opposition. In opposition, before the election, we said that we would repeal section 18C in its current form. That is what we said we would do before the election and that, as the Australian people would expect, is exactly what we are doing after the election. This is a government which keeps its commitments. This is a clear commitment that we made.

  I thank the member for Tangney for reminding the House that the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the Minister for Education, planned to cut $1.2 billion in schools funding from Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. The coalition's funding promise was that we would put $2.8 billion into schools funding over the forward estimates while Labor's promise was that they would cut $1.2 billion, reducing the total amount of funding to $1.6 billion. I table a document showing the impact that the re-election of Labor would have had on schools across Western Australia. Imagine my surprise when I heard, on the weekend, claims by the shadow minister for education that the government was cutting education funding in Western Australia. Under Labor, she would have been right. Under Labor, Western Australia would have experienced a funding cut. Under the coalition government, on the other hand, she was wrong. We are putting $120 million more over the forward estimates into schools funding in Western Australia.                  I do not blame the shadow minister. She was right to be confused. She was probably confused because similar claims have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. He too has said that he was putting $2.8 billion into schools funding, when he was actually only putting $1.6 billion into schools funding. It is like when he said that he was against the mining tax but he voted not repeal it in Canberra, or when he said he was against the rising cost of living but he voted against the carbon tax being repealed in Canberra. The Leader of the Opposition is the Mr Potato Head of Australian politics. You can put whatever face you like on the Leader of the Opposition -                      I am sorry if it offends the Leader of the Opposition to be referred to as Mr Potato Head. I am happy to withdraw the allusion. Perhaps he would be happier with an allusion to Hugo, the man of a thousand faces, who those of us from 1975 would remember very fondly.                     Madam Speaker, I have already withdrawn my remarks. I said that I would withdraw my remarks unconditionally. I also said that if the Leader of the Opposition did not like the allusion, then he could go back further in time, to 1975, to Hugo, the man of a thousand faces. He was another toy to which you could add any face you liked.                     Madam Speaker, I am trying to put into context that the problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he has one position for one audience and another position for another audience.                      Depending on where he is in Australia, he has a different position. Depending on the audience he is talking to, he has a different position. He is no longer the faceless man of Australian politics; he is the two-faced man of Australian politics. He has a different position wherever he is in the country and he needs to show some substance.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question.                     I am happy to update the House on the government's progress in keeping its commitments, because that is what this government does: it keeps its commitments. What it says before the election, it does after the election. But today -                  The Speaker has been critical of the use of phrases at the end of questions, such as 'are there any threats to_', that could be viewed as intended to allow Ministers to canvass opposition plans or policies.                     I can understand why the Manager of Opposition Business would be so reluctant to hear the answer to this question, because when he was minister for immigration his record for boats turning up in Australia is that he could not get past six days. Six days was the longest period of time when he was the minister that we went without a boat turning up.                  I am going to refer to the Human Rights Commissioner, Gillian Triggs, and this is what she had to say today: 'There is an objective fact here that by using border patrols, by using Customs officers and military officers, we have physically stopped the boats.' That is what she says. She goes on: 'One has to accept the physical fact that the boats have been stopped from landing on Christmas Island or being brought to Christmas Island. I think we also in fairness have to accept that it is very likely that many lives have been saved at sea.' So, that is clear.                  I can update the House that it is 95 days since our last successful people-smuggling venture. During the same 95 days last year, there were 55 boats and 3,116 people who turned up. The people, the policies and the resolve are what is producing these results. It is a position of conviction, not convenience, that drives the policies and those on this side of the House. As for those on the other side of the House, well their heart was just never in it when they were in government, and it seems that nothing has changed. I read -                      Senator Dastyari has given a speech on the weekend and he has referred to the double-mindedness of those opposite when he said:                 Labor is and continues to need to be prepared to have an open debate about the future of our migration policies. The fact is, over the past few years we have tossed and turned on these issues.                 In order to have successful border protection policies, you have to be consistent, you have to have unity. The only person on that side of the House who has been consistent in their policies on border protection is the member for Chisholm. The only problem is that the member for Chisholm's policies are against those currently articulated by the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite. At least there is one member opposite who is prepared to be consistent. For the rest of them it is a cavalcade of every position you could possibly imagine under the sun, except for the ones that actually worked. We know that even now Senator Dastyari is saying that he is uncomfortable with the opposition's current position on offshore processing, so the question for the Leader of the Opposition is: what are their policies when it comes to border protection? That is what people in Western Australia will be asking. They know what our policies are. Does the opposition leader support the policy that is working, which is turning boats back where it is safe to do so?

  I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and note that it was his concern about this process and how it affected childcare operators in his electorate that brought this matter to the attention of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General, with his extensive powers of access and scrutiny, is the appropriate body with the appropriate powers to examine these issues further.                 Let us remind ourselves about the Early Years Quality Fund, which was never about the early years and never about quality, but was a $300 million hijack of taxpayer funds in pursuit of a union recruitment drive. Some of the key things that the independent PricewaterhouseCoopers report found when we came into government, I remind the House, were that only 15 per cent of all childcare workers could ever have received a dollar from this fund and then only for two years; it had nothing to do with merit - it was a first-in, first-served scramble for the money; and it did not follow the usual processes and guidelines.                 Who presided over this giant muddle? It was the member for Adelaide as minister in charge. And one of the interesting things that did come out of our PricewaterhouseCoopers report was that the guidelines of the then minister said that the minister would advise the sector as soon as possible when the funding cap had been reached - as soon as possible. We know that the fund opened at 11 o'clock on 23 July and closed at midnight on 24 July - 13 hours later - Member for Adelaide, and it was your role, according to your program guidelines, to advise the sector. But, months later, people were still using time, money and lawyers to apply for a fund that had completely vanished. There are questions that the member for Adelaide needs to answer.                 What a shambles is this modern Labor Party. What a long, long way they have drifted from where they began, from their origins in the shearing sheds of western Queensland and under the Tree of Knowledge in Barcaldine - where the member for Maranoa wins the booth on first preferences - as a party for the workers. The Liberal and National parties know a union rort when we see one, we know a union slush fund when we see one and we also know -                      that the interests of the unions as represented by the Labor members in this place are not the same as the interests of the workers.

  I thank the member for Ryan for her question, and I can assure her and her constituents that the government is determined to restore the rule of law on building construction sites around Australia. Under the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the minister for workplace relations, the rule of the jungle was allowed to reign. But the coalition is moving to protect the rights of both employers and employees. We are doing that by reinstituting the Australian Building and Construction Commission, by starting the Registered Organisations Commission and by holding a royal commission into union corruption and union thuggery, all of which have been opposed by the Leader of the Opposition or, at best, have received lukewarm support, in the case of the royal commission. But there has been outright opposition to the Registered Organisations Commission and the Australian Building and Construction Commission.                 We are also moving to align civil and criminal penalties for union officials with those for company directors, because we believe that union officials should be subject to exactly the same rules and regulations as company directors. And on that final point, let me say that we have had some support from unlikely sources. The national secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Paul Howes, who has announced his retirement today, has given unlikely support to the coalition for these changes. He said:                 I can't see any reason why anyone in the movement would fear having the same penalties that apply to company directors. If you're a crook, you're a crook.                 Who could disagree with that statement made by Paul Howes, the now-retiring national secretary of the Australian Workers Union? But it seems that the Leader of the Opposition disagrees with that statement. Paul Howes, the national secretary of the AWU, is showing the real leadership that the Labor Party lacks in this place. He is the kind of union leader and union secretary who actually puts workers first. The Leader of the Opposition is incapable of showing that kind of strength of leadership, because he is too scared to stand up to the union bosses who put him in the job. He cannot stand up to the union bosses because the faceless men of the Labor Party put him into power. The people's choice is sitting over there; the union's choice is sitting in front of the Prime Minister -                      I am not surprised that they make that point of order, because they do not want to hear the truth. They do not want to hear that the Leader of the Opposition is a union official representing union officials. They do not want to hear that he is running a protection racket for a protection racket. We might have lost one faceless man today, but the numbers are made up by the two-faced Leader of the Opposition we have sitting opposite us.

  I thank the member for Petrie for his question and acknowledge his longstanding support and advocacy for the veterans' community. Consistent with our election commitment, and consistent with being a government that does what it says, and says what it does, last Thursday we introduced the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Legislation Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2014. It has been a long time coming, getting justice for our veterans. It is a proud government that was able to introduce this bill on behalf of 57,000 DFRB and DFRDB members and their families, including 1,234 members, and their families, in the member's electorate.                 This side has long recognised the unique nature of military service. We have maintained a consistent and principled position - both in opposition and now in government - on the need to fairly index DFRB and DFRDB superannuation pensions. This is something we committed to in the 2010 election and the 2013 election, just gone. The legislation is clear proof that we will stand up for those who stand for us.                 The member also quite rightly asked if there were any risks to enacting this policy. The simple answer is yes. The entire risk matrix sits opposite us, in the intransigence of the Labor Party. We know that in 2007 Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party promised veterans a: 'generous superannuation system'. They were the words that were used. Instead they spent the entire six years of their government defending an excuse as to why they were denying veterans and their families indexation.                 Their road to Damascus moment came a mere week from the election. When Mike Kelly's seat was under threat, they rushed through a half-baked veterans indexation policy. Not once, not twice, but on three separate occasions those opposite voted against the coalition when we attempted to legislate for the fair indexation of DFRB and DFRDB schemes. Labor even commissioned its own report, after the 2007 election, to substantiate and justify its backflip. It would have been extremely helpful if there had been a 2013 Labor veterans policy. Instead, all we had was the half-baked, Mike Kelly abridged veterans DFRDB indexation scheme.                 I ask the Leader of the Opposition if he is going to stand in the way. There are 5,438 members and their dependents in WA who are right now waiting to know if you are going to stand in the way. Those 5,438 people want to know if you will stand up for fair indexation, as does the rest of the country.

  I accept that this is a difficult issue; I accept that it is an issue that arouses strong passions in our community, on both sides. And I think it should be treated with seriousness and with balance in this parliament. What the government is attempting to do - as carefully, as collegially and as consultatively as we can - is to get the balance right.                     What we want to do is to maintain the red light for bigotry - to use the metaphor of the member who asked the question - but we want to remove the amber light for free speech.                     We want to remove the amber light for free speech. That is what we are attempting to do. All of us deplore racism, we abhor bigotry. All of us in this country want to be our best selves. Australians at their best are a decent and welcoming people who are also a people who can engage in very robust free speech without fear of prosecution.

  I thank the member for Herbert for his question, and I do appreciate his concerns to ensure that the ordinary working families - indeed, under the former government, the ordinary forgotten families of our country - get a fair go. If there is one figure that should reverberate around this House every day until the carbon tax is finally repealed, it is $550 a year. That is the additional burden that the families and households of Australia face because of members opposite and their carbon tax.                 What this government wants to do and what we are being prevented from doing by members opposite is to scrap the carbon tax but keep the compensation the families and households of Australia got. We want to do the right thing by the families of Australia. I just cannot understand why, after everything that has happened, after the election last year that was so bitterly contested, members opposite are still siding with the Greens, and against the people, in supporting this toxic tax. I just cannot understand it, because members opposite know just how bad this tax is.                 Labor members of the Senate by-election team were proclaiming loudly in Perth last Thursday that they were 'scrapping the carbon tax'. Well, on the very day they said they were scrapping the carbon tax in Perth, they were supporting the carbon tax here in Canberra. You just cannot trust them.                 This is a government that is determined to ease the cost of living pressures on families. We will do this not just by scrapping bad taxes and not just by eliminating unnecessary regulation, but by boosting economic growth through sensible free trade agreements with our major trading partners. We are pursuing a free trade agreement with Japan and a free trade agreement with China to complement the free trade agreement we have already secured with Korea. We are doing so for this reason: trade means jobs. Freer trade benefits both countries. It benefits the buyer, it benefits the seller and it is good for workers and families in both countries, and that is what we want. We want a strong and more prosperous Australia, in a stronger and more prosperous world.

  I accept that this is a very important question, and I will do my best to deal with the question of the member opposite with the respect that it deserves. Of course none of us want to see bigotry.                     The proposed change to section 18C contains a very strong prohibition on racial vilification. It contains a very strong prohibition on inciting racial hatred. It contains a very strong prohibition on any attempt to engage in racial intimidation, as it should. But it also provides for the appropriate protection of free speech. That is not racial abuse. It just means that if we are having a legitimate discussion, as we are entitled to in a free and robust democracy such as ours, then contributions to that discussion will not be proscribed by law. That is the balance that this government is attempting, in good faith, to get right - the important balance between protections, which people are entitled to, and free speech, which people are also entitled to.

  I thank the member for Forrest for her question. Like the Prime Minister I do not understand why the Labor Party, in opposition, would try to defend the carbon tax. After promising before the 2010 election not to introduce a carbon tax, they then introduced a carbon tax after the election. Before the last election they said they were going to terminate the carbon tax, but now they are voting to keep it. They are entirely inconsistent with whatever they say before an election. The impact on the people of Western Australia is significant. Last year alone -                      That is right, it is consistency. I take the interjection. It is consistent to be inconsistent. That is the Labor Party's approach, because last year alone the carbon tax cost Western Australians $600 million. Even economic modelling commissioned from Treasury by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments identified that the negative impact on the Western Australian economy would be significant. Manufacturing output would be hit. In fact, if you get rid of the carbon tax, manufacturing output in Western Australia will increase by nearly 3.5 per cent over the next 16 years. On the same basis, construction output in Western Australia will improve by nearly one per cent. Gross state product in Western Australia will improve by nearly one per cent - all because you get rid of the carbon tax. Keeping the carbon tax actually hurts Western Australia, just as keeping the carbon tax hurts Australia. It detracts from economic growth, and of course GDP would be 0.3 per cent lower than otherwise in 2020 as a result of the carbon tax. It will cost the Australian economy $1 trillion by 2050 if the carbon tax remains in place.                 So why does the Labor Party not want to get rid of the carbon tax? They go to Western Australia and say to the people of Western Australia, 'We are getting rid of the carbon tax. We are opposed to the carbon tax.' Then they come back to Canberra and they vote to keep it. Only today, just an hour ago, the Labor Party was so appalled about the impact of the mining tax on Western Australia that a few minutes ago in the Senate they voted to keep the mining tax. They really care about Western Australia, because every time they come to Canberra they do everything they possibly can to make life harder for the people of Western Australia.

  Fair enough. We are capable of robust debate in this place. I think Australians are capable of robust debate, and that is what I want to facilitate in this country.                     I want it to be civil - of course I want it to be civil - but in the end the truth is that, when people are arguing things that they feel passionately about, it will inevitably be at times offensive, at times insulting, and I do not believe that the mere fact that someone might be put off by what is being said should mean that the person speaking should feel the full sanction of law against them. That is our position. I reject any suggestion from the member who asked the question that Australia is a bigoted country. We are not. We are a decent and a fair country. Yes, occasionally people give in to unworthy impulse in this country, as in others, but we are the freest, the fairest and the most decent country on earth.                     I conclude with this observation. No-one wants to see bigotry or intolerance in our society, but I say this: the best counter to a bad argument is a good one, and the best antidote to bigotry is decency, proclaimed by people engaging in a free and fair debate.

  I thank the member for Indi for her question. I am a frequent visitor to the seat of Indi. I was there, in Mansfield, over the weekend. Having grown up in rural Victoria and having family in rural Victoria, I share her concerns about the plight of the residents, and particularly the aged residents, of rural parts of Australia.                 To come to her question: it is true that the government pays an accommodation supplement to assist low-wealth residents who cannot meet the normal costs of aged care. In order to encourage aged-care providers to take more low-wealth residents into their homes, it pays that supplement where, as the member for Indi pointed out, 40 per cent of the residents are of low wealth, as defined by the legislation and the regulations. In those situations which the member for Indi alludes to where less than 40 per cent of the residents of a particular aged-care home are deemed to be low-wealth individuals, rather than 100 per cent of the aged-care supplement being paid, 75 per cent of the aged-care supplement is paid. As I understand from the latest data, that 75 per cent amounts to about $25 per person per day. So, in addition to the other payments which are received by the aged-care provider, where less than 40 per cent of the residents are deemed to be low-wealth individuals, then a payment of approximately $25 per person per day is paid.                 Now, it is true that there are some further changes coming in from 1 July which reflect upgrading of particular residential accommodation in various parts of Australia. Can I simply add, to what I have explained of the way in which the system works, that the government has asked the Australian Aged Care Financial Authority to advise it on the support of low-wealth individuals - not only in rural areas of Australia but, indeed, right across Australia - in terms of their accommodation in aged care. Finally, we are also examining the needs of rural aged-care services in relation to the election commitment we made to re-purpose the aged-care workforce supplement. The government has that matter under consideration at the present time. But I can advise the member for Indi, and, indeed, all other representatives of rural and regional parts of Australia, that that is under active consideration at the present time.                 Finally, as the member for Indi raised matters concerning her electorate, I am not sure if she knows, but the Deputy Prime Minister recently approved a community development grant for the Bright Hospital to look at the feasibility of the redevelopment of that hospital.

  I thank the honourable member for Petrie for his question and I note that the only way we can start strengthening the Australian economy is to start strengthening the Australian budget - we inherited from Labor $123 billion of deficits and $667 billion of debt. We will be unable to fix this problem unless we actually are allowed to get on with the job of strengthening the budget. The budget is presented for a four-year period. That has been happening for some period of time. At the last election, the Labor Party said that the deficit this year would be $47 billion and, subsequently, $34 billion in the second year, a $24 billion deficit in the third year and a $18 billion deficit in the fourth year.                 In the upcoming budget in May, for the first time, the fifth year comes in. When we were in opposition, we continually pointed out that Labor were pushing a tsunami of new spending into the fifth year. For the first time, we are starting to get a picture of it. In the fifth year, we have in real terms an increase in education expenditure of 3Â½ per cent. Labor said it would not be more than two per cent. In health, we see an increase of 4.2 per cent. Labor said it would not be more than two per cent. In defence, we see an increase of 13 per cent in one year - back ended expenditure by Labor. They said it would not be more than two per cent. For overseas aid, foreign aid, Labor back loaded in the fifth year a 66 per cent increase in foreign aid. And, of course, in disability spending, there will be a 125 per cent increase as the NDIS comes into play. And it was not properly paid for.                 The IMF surveyed 17 leading countries and identified that the Labor Party left the biggest increase in expenditure of the 17 top IMF countries in the world. It was the biggest increase in expenditure and the fastest increase in debt of the 17 surveyed nations. That is the Labor legacy. I say to the people of Australia, and I say to all the members of the House: we are going to set about fixing this problem in the best interests of the Australian people.

  I make the point that the statements that are being quoted across this chamber by the shadow minister are abhorrent, they are offensive and they are wrong.                    What the government are proposing to do is to maintain the red light on inciting racial hatred, but we are removing the amber light on free speech, which section 18C, in its current form, maintains. That is what we are doing. We are also attempting to engage the community in this, as you would expect. I point out to the member opposite that what we have proposed today is an exposure draft of legislation. We are looking forward to further engagement with the community. Based on the engagement that we have with the community, over the next 30 days we will finalise the legislation and bring it into the parliament in the budget session.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. He represents an electorate almost the size of New South Wales. I was there over the weekend and appreciated how important it is to have a road network that is able to deliver the services and take away the exports from that highly productive region.                 In particular, the local roads are very, very important to electorates like Kalgoorlie. Indeed, the Roads to Recovery program has been one of the most popular programs, particularly amongst all local governments, since it was instituted by the Howard-Anderson government. It was a program that was carried through the Rudd, Gillard and Rudd governments - one of the few programs that was carried through. And now the coalition government is committed to funding a further $1.75 billion for the Roads to Recovery program to help local councils with their roads and streets right across the nation. It is a popular program, and I have heard Labor members saying how valuable it is and how they support it.                 I was amazed, therefore, that yesterday in the House of Representatives the Labor Party voted against the legislation to continue the Roads to Recovery program for another five years. They voted against the legislation that will enable the vital road and local street works to continue. What we have to remember is that if this particular legislation is not passed through the Senate then the Roads to Recovery program will end. Labor and Greens combined: they voted against it in the House of Representatives and certainly have indicated their intention to also vote against it in the Senate.                 What the people of O'Connor need to realise - and the people of Western Australia, which will receive about $55 million every year for local roads and streets under this program - is that if they vote in senators who are not prepared to support the land transport bill that went through the House of Representatives yesterday, if they are not prepared to support that bill, then this much-loved program right across the nation will end. Without the Greens and the Labor Party voting for this in the Senate - unless there are senators there who will support the Roads to Recovery program - this program will come to an end.                 And so there is a very clear message again: Labor candidates, Labor members and Labor senators say one thing in Western Australia, say one thing when they are visiting regional councils - when they had the opportunity yesterday to declare their support for the Roads to Recovery program, they actually voted to terminate the program. They voted that it should not proceed. What is essential for regional Australians, people who live in the suburbs of Australia, is that they elect senators who will vote this legislation in.

  As I said, this is draft legislation which has gone out for consultation with the community. We think that the legislation gets the balance right. We think that the legislation preserves protections while removing any element of -                      Madam Speaker, let us see what various community organisations say in response to the exposure legislation that we are making available. But I will say this: I know the migrant communities of Australia pretty well, and I know that they have voted for this country with their feet. I know that they have embraced our way of life, they have embraced our Australian system, and part of our system is robust freedom of speech.

  I thank the honourable member for the question, and I note that from day one he has been opposed to the mining tax. And from day one the coalition has been opposed to the mining tax. And what a horrible birth this tax had. I well recall Colin Barnett, the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, ringing up Prime Minister Rudd and asking him what could he possibly be thinking to introduce a tax like that. And Kevin Rudd responded that it was all Wayne Swan's idea. And so the architect of the tax, which has been a complete, unmitigated disaster for the Labor Party, is still in the Labor Party, is still in opposition, is still in parliament and is still supporting upholding a tax that has been an abject failure. In 100 years' time when tax classes are taught at university they will look back and ask, 'Mr Professor, what was the worst tax that was ever designed?' And the professor will respond, 'It was the five versions of the mining tax'.                     The carbon tax is close, but there was only one version of the carbon tax. There are five versions of a mining tax that originally was meant to raise $12Â½ billion next year and at the end of the day is hardly raising anything. The problem is Labor spent the money that they never got: $16 billion of expenditure; $16 billion they precommitted, pre-spent against a tax that barely raises a dollar. That is irresponsible budgeting. You would not do it in your home, let alone for the nation. But Labor did, because that is the Labor way.                 And the other part of the Labor way is this unholy partnership with the Greens. It was the Greens that they relied on to get passage of the mining tax. It was the Greens who they relied upon an hour ago in the Senate to oppose the repeal of the mining tax. It was the Greens who supported them to deliver a carbon tax and it was the Greens who supported Labor to uphold the carbon tax. The only way to get rid of the mining tax is to vote for the Liberals and the Nationals in the upcoming Senate election in Western Australia. The only way to get rid of the carbon tax is to vote for the Liberals and the Nationals in the upcoming Senate election in Western Australia. The only way to send a message to the Labor Party is: never vote for them and never support them. But even then, Labor still stands by bad policies that cost jobs and cost families' their income.

  It is certainly not the only priority of this government. Our priorities are scrapping the carbon tax and boosting the families' incomes, scrapping the mining tax and boosting investment in jobs, cutting red tape and boosting productivity and economic activity, and getting freer trade agreements in place so that our agricultural exporters will get a fair go at last in the wider world. We are advancing on a wide front to the rescue of this nation. That is what we are doing, but part of what we are doing -                      Let me point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the repeal of section 18C in its current form was a policy and a position that we took to the last election. It was in place for at least 12 months, before the last election, and now the Leader of Opposition is choosing to play politics - in an attempt to engage in a bit of dog whistling on this issue, just like they engaged in a bit of dog whistling on 457 visas.                     Let me make it absolutely crystal clear. I believe that the members opposite are serious about wanting to protect and preserve free speech, but I hope they will also believe that members on this side of the chamber are serious about wanting to ensure that there is no place for racism in our society. That is why what we are doing with the exposure draft legislation, which was released today, is clearly prohibiting racial vilification and racial intimidation by providing for reasonable debate in the robust democracy that is this country.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for her question. I can inform the House, more in sorrow than in anger, that the former member for Dobell Mr Craig Thomson has been sentenced in the Melbourne Magistrate's Court today to 12 months imprisonment with nine months suspension, so he will serve three months in jail, with a two-year good behaviour bond for the theft of $24,000 from members of the Health Services Union.                  This is a very sad day for the parliament. It is a sad day that one of the former members of this place has fallen so far in the estimation of its society that he is going to jail for theft. It is a particularly sad day for the once-great Labor Party and the Labor movement that one of their own - whom they nurtured, brought into parliament and then protected until April 2012 - has been sentenced to jail today. It is great sadness that the once-great party of Chifley and Curtin is now the party of Obeid, Macdonald, Williamson and Thomson. But it also represents an opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to join the government in passing the registered organisations commission bill in the Senate, which he is currently blocking, to pass the Australian building and construction commission bill in the Senate, which he is currently blocking, and to full-throatedly support the royal commission into union corruption and thuggery.                  Perhaps members opposite should take some advice from Martin Ferguson, from another great family of the Labor movement, one of whom still sits in this place. Martin Ferguson said on 28 February, 'The Labor Party has got to change and our relationship with the union movement has got to change, both internally and externally - it is not the union movement I grew up in.'                 If the Leader of the Opposition took that advice and the advice of Paul Howes, who is also known to support severing the ties between the union movement and the Labor Party, he would be able to show that he was standing on his own two feet, that he was not just a puppet of the union movement. He should sever his ties with the union movement, as advised by Paul Howes and Martin Ferguson, and make a clean break from people like Williamson and Thomson from the Health Services Union and from the Obeid and Macdonald stain that sits on the Labor Party. While he is at it, to really prove that he has separated himself from the dodgy aspects of the union movement, he should pay back the $267,000 of Health Service Union members' money that was used to elect Craig Thomson in 2007 to this place. It would be cheap for him to do that. It would be a sign of good faith with those members of the HSU. I call on him to do so and to be a big enough man to do so.

  That particular aspiration was pushed out every year by members opposite when they were in government. It remains the aspiration of this government. The first duty of this government is to bring the budget back into sustainable surplus. Once the budget is back into sustainable surplus, then we will reconsider this matter of 0.5 per cent of GNI. In the meantime we will generally be increasing foreign aid by CPI.

  I thank the member for Tangney for his question and his concern about childcare affordability in Western Australia. I am sure he is also interested in the Auditor-General confirming that his office will officially examine and scrutinise Labor's $300 million Early Years Quality Fund. That was the fund that was not about the early years and was not about quality; it was about $300 million of hijacked taxpayers' money in pursuit of union recruitment. The independent PricewaterhouseCoopers report said many things, including that Labor's EYQF was inherently unfair, inequitable and drove a greater pay divide in the sector.                      The member for Adelaide is quite welcome to ask me questions without notice any question time.                     In Western Australia there are 1,348 childcare centres, of those 510 are long day care centres. So, under the member for Adelaide's policy, 838 were out in the cold from the word go. They could never have applied. They were not grounds for union recruitment drives.                      Only five per cent of the workforce was even allocated a slice of the action under Labor's so-called Early Years Quality Fund. Interestingly enough, the unions were front and centre of this, Member for Adelaide. They were also front and centre for the member for Adelaide's re-election campaign because in a Daily Telegraph report -                    The member for Kingsford Smith then left the chamber.                     I refer to a report in The Daily Telegraph in August 2013, which said:                 A confidential email intended for members of United Voice this week demanded child care workers join Ms Ellis' campaign team this weekend and door knock residents.                 But that was not all, in a shameful misuse of the member for Adelaide's ministerial position in the dying days of the 2013 campaign, she sent home flyers -                    The member for Adelaide                    then left the chamber.                   The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                     From the member for Adelaide to childcare centres on the eve of the election: 'Please print this flyer. Put it in parents' pigeon holes. Stick it up in your centre before pick-up time' - a shameful misuse of her ministerial position.

  Talk about cooking the books! It is like an episode of Masterchefover there! Fair dinkum. There, you've got some of the best. The member for Lilley, he really cooked them - he overcooked them. He promised a surplus. Three hundred times he promised a surplus! I have heard of a souffle rising twice, but not 300 times! And then along comes another chef.                     Of course, then along came the member for McMahon. And the books were so cooked that he piled on the mustard, he piled on the horseradish, he piled on the barbecue sauce -                      and I think you would agree, the term 'cooking the books' brings certain imputations, and I ask you to bring the Treasurer back to the subject he has been asked about.                     The problem is, the Labor party cooked the books and the rest of Australia got food poisoning! Talk about cooking the books - Labor was adept at it. And they still do not understand how to put the recipe together.                    -                      The member for McMahon does not understand the recipe! He came into this place all indignant about debt. The member for McMahon does not even know the difference between net debt and gross debt.                                       -                      He does not even understand the recipe! And yet the Labor Party has the gall to come in and say we have cooked the books!                   The member for Griffith                    then left the chamber.                     It was the Labor Party that kept promising a surplus. It was the Labor Party that kept making big heroic promises about the economy that were never delivered. Every single number Labor published for six years was wrong. Every single number! And it was not just their own incompetence, it was Labor Party deceit. Shuffling payments and shuffling revenue from year to year in order to try and manufacture a surplus. And they believed their own cooking! They went out there and said, 'We've delivered a surplus'. They did not even pretend! They actually went out there and told the Australian people - and paid for it using taxpayers' money - 'We have delivered a surplus.' The fact is, they were just $123 billion short. That is a big number for you -                      I would say to the member for McMahon that no matter how much he cries out he will not find any aid overseas.

  Thank you to the member for Pearce, and what a terrific addition he is to our side of the House from Western Australia. He has a great background and we are sure that he will make a significant contribution on this side of House.                 I can say to the member for Pearce that the infrastructure Prime Minister is going to help you with your seat because he is ensuring that the Swan Valley Bypass will be built, with money out of the budget - not out of an imaginary mining tax revenue which does not exist. The Great Northern Highway upgrade, which will benefit his electorate, will also be built. Those projects will go ahead because they are important projects for Western Australia's future. They will deliver higher economic performance and ensure that our mining industry can be as successful as those of us on our side of the House wanted to be.                 We do not think that continuing to put pressure on the mining industry by additional taxes, whether those be the mining tax or the carbon tax, is the best way to run an economy. We think that taking pressure off business by taking red tape off business and taking unnecessary taxes off business will help us to deliver the infrastructure of the 21st century so we can grow more quickly.                 Of course, it is the other side of the House who think that putting a mining tax that does not raise any revenue in place and then allocating it against projects is the best way to run an economy. Today is the three-year anniversary since the designer-in-chief of the mining tax, the brains behind the operation on that side of the House, came up with the mining tax with this quote, 'If you don't have the revenue from the mining tax' - this is the member for Lilley - 'then you can't make the investments.' That is what he said, three years ago today, on 25 March 2011 - 'If you don't have the revenue from the tax then you can't make the investments.'                 Well, we do not have the revenue from the tax - the $12 billion estimated next year and the trickle that will come into the budget - but we are delivering the infrastructure because the infrastructure Prime Minister knows that you need to put in place the infrastructure of the 21st century so that you have a stronger economy.                 The member for Lilley was responsible for the mining tax. He was responsible for the debt and deficit that our country is now burdened under and he was responsible for the deal on the carbon tax that left the Labor Party in opposition. On this side we are going to ensure that we have an economy which is growing; an economy which has the least amount of tax that need be applied to it, and we are going to get rid of unnecessary taxes.                    -                      You are very excited, Tanya. The superclinics question is coming. Don't worry; it is on its way!                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. Of course the government will abolish the mining tax. It is necessary for us to abolish the mining tax, but we need the Labor Party to listen to the Australian people and get out of the way so that we can continue to deliver infrastructure projects for the member for Pearce and for Western Australia. That is what we were elected to do and that is what the infrastructure Prime Minister will deliver.

  Our budget, as released in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, was right; the numbers were right. Every number Labor produced for six years was wrong. A little bit earlier, the member for McMahon - before I ran out of time - asked me about foreign aid. The Labor Party cut $5.7 billion out of foreign aid in the last 15 months in government -                      And the reason why the member for McMahon wants to look at whether he would be the beneficiary of foreign aid is that, under Labor, Australia became the third-biggest beneficiary of its own foreign aid program. Can you believe that? They were spending foreign aid in Australia. We became the third-biggest recipient of our own foreign aid program under Labor.                     So please spare us and spare the Australian people the rank hypocrisy of the Labor Party. Australians have had enough. The Labor Party got every number wrong. They engaged in deceit and deception when it came to the budget. Our numbers are fair dinkum, and we are being fair dinkum with the Australian people.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. The Labor Party promised 250,000 Australians that they would be eligible for the Interim Satellite Service but only bought capacity to service 48,000. They promised the service would deliver six megs down and one meg up for the same price as a city ADSL service. As the honourable member for Durack knows, most of the 5,600 interim satellite users in Western Australia are now getting no better - and often worse - than dial-up speeds. Kids cannot do their homework, and farmers cannot access the online National Livestock Identification System, real-time prices or weather services.                 The $351-million Interim Satellite Service of Labor has been a train wreck. The 45,000 unhappy current customers are costing the taxpayers of this nation $7,300 each in direct subsidies. That is nearly three times the level of the old Howard-era Australian Broadband Guarantee subsidy, and for a much worse service. It is our job to clean up Labor's messes, including the Conrovian ones. But I have to say that many, including this one, do not lend themselves to an easy or obvious solution. Indeed, the previous minister washed his hands of this in the last few months of his ministry.                 Here are the measures that we are announcing today: first, at a cost of $18.4 million, the NBN Co will upgrade the current capacity to all users on this satellite service by one third; and, second, we will introduce a new stringent fair use policy to ensure a minority of very heavy users cannot crowd out the majority. The NBN Co's trials of these changes demonstrate that even in busy periods families will be able to answer their emails, surf the web, do their banking and see their kids complete their homework. It will not be as fast as the speeds promised but never delivered by Labor, but it will be broadband at much higher speeds and certainly not anywhere near the anaemic dial-up speeds experienced at present.                 We are also working on additional measures to provide new services so that at least some of those customers - about 9,000 in total - who have not been able to get on, will be able to do so, and we will have more to say about that in coming days when the arrangements are complete.                   You might well ask why these changes - these measures - were not undertaken by the previous minister. Maybe they were suggested to him, but as the former deputy chair of NBN Co, Diane Smith-Gander, said today when asked whether the board had ever suggested to Stephen Conroy that he should conduct a cost-benefit analysis, 'Think about - '

  This is a government that will repair the budget, but it is also a government that will keep its commitments. Some of the commitments that we made were quite tough and uncompromising commitments that involved making serious savings, including savings that a lot of people would not like. Even though the income support bonus goes to some 1.3 million Australians, we had the courage to say, pre-election, that it would not be continued under a coalition government, because a coalition government does not believe in spending what it does not have. You cannot give people benefits endlessly on the nation's credit card, and that is the problem with members opposite. They have engaged in a species of intergenerational theft. That is what they have engaged in. Under members opposite, there was $123 billion of cumulative debt, $667 billion of debt, $123 billion of accumulated deficits - that is the problem that we are wrestling with. We will not shirk the difficult decisions needed to engage in the job of fiscal repair, because we understand and we believe the Australian people understand that, if you want to fix the economy, you have got to fix the budget first, and that is exactly what this government will do.

  It is nice to get a question from the Hon. Bill Shorten, who has on his frontbench the Hon. Mark Dreyfus, Queen's Counsel.                     This government's priorities are very clear -                     -                      we want to take the burdens off families that members opposite put on them.                    -                      We want to get rid of the carbon tax. Last week, Labor voted to keep the carbon tax.                    -                      We want to get rid of the mining tax. Yesterday, Labor voted to keep the mining tax. We want to get rid of some 10,000 redundant regulations and acts of parliament, and I bet you this, Madam Speaker, Labor will vote to keep them.                    -                      We want to restore the rule of law in the construction industry, and Labor has voted against that. We want to clean up corruption inside the union movement, and Labor is opposed to that. This is a government which is focussed on doing the right thing by the families of Australia -                     -                      Always will be, and if the Leader of the Opposition is serious about focusing on the priorities of Australian families he will get with the government, scrap the carbon tax, scrap the mining tax and restore the rule of law in our difficult industries.

  I thank the member for Forde for his question, and I can reassure him and members opposite that every day - every day - this government is working to make the lives of Australian families easier.                 One of the things that most people abhor is the time spent filling out forms, because time spent filling out forms costs money and it prevents people from getting on with their lives. That is why today is red tape 'repeal day'. That is why the government will scrap some 10,000 unnecessary and redundant regulations and acts of parliament. That is why we will take 50,000 pages off the statute books, because we want to make the lives of Australia families, the life of Australian businesses easier. These changes -                     -                      These changes will save the businesses and the people of Australia $720 million a year, every year. That is real money thanks to the real reforms of this government.                     Scrapping the carbon tax will not just save a $9-billion tax hit on the economy, it will not just save every household $550 a year, but scrapping the carbon tax will remove $85 million - $85 million - in red tape costs from the backs of the businesses of Australia.                 This has been welcomed. This been widely welcomed. I quote Jennifer Westacott of the Business Council of Australia -                     -                      She said:                 The release today of the federal government's repeal day legislation marks a turning point in dealing with the high costs and inefficiencies faced by businesses and consumers in our economy                   The member for Franklin then left the chamber.

  This is not a question. This is a sneer. It is a false sneer. It is a sneer and a smear from a member from parliament who should know better. We have more than kept our commitments on school education. Labor cut $1.2 billion from school education in the pre-election fiscal outlook on top of the $3.9 billion that the Leader of the Opposition, then the education minister, cut from education and training in the 2012 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We are keeping our commitments; Labor is breaking its commitments - even its saving commitments, the commitments that it took to the election and is now ratting on in the Senate. We are keeping our commitments. We have been and we will be a trustworthy government. That will be the contrast between this government and its predecessor.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. He is a former Treasurer of Western Australia and he is well aware of the challenge of inheriting a budget mess from Labor, as he did. The fundamental point is that if you get on with the job of fixing the budget, you have a chance of fixing the economy. When you have a weak budget that is consistently running deficits, that is constantly accumulating debt for the nation, then that, over time, can unquestionably weaken the economy. There have been many different surveys on this, but the truth is that it is good to have a strong budget. That is why we have to get back to surplus and a sustainable surplus at that. The Labor Party is in denial. They left behind deficits totalling $123 billion and debt increasing to $667 billion. They left a time frame that shows not a single surplus over the next 10 years. That is Labor's legacy. The fact is that they did not know how to control spending.                     Don't believe me if you don't want to, but believe the IMF, which released a report in February this year that found that Labor's spending would rise to 26.5 per cent of GDP by 2023. That is up from today's 25.9 per cent, so it would increase as a percentage of GDP. The IMF said:                 _ health and disability spending are expected to increase over the next decade by Â½ percent of GDP each, and education, assistance to the aged and pensions by 0.2 percent each.                 That is the equivalent of an extra $32 billion a year in spending in today's dollars. That would take the budget deficit this year to well over $70 billion. Labor can be in denial about this, but it is a fact identified by the Treasury, by every credible commentator, by the IMF, by those people who are determined to tell the truth.                     The truth is your greatest stranger, I say to the member for Lilley. The fact is you never delivered it.

  I will do my best to answer both elements of the Leader of the Opposition's question in a straightforward way. We are not delaying the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the Leader of the Opposition should not try to put fear into the minds of people with disabilities by suggesting that we are. We are not delaying the paid parental leave scheme. The coalition took that proposal to both the last election and the election before it, and of course we stand by it. It was clearly part of our policy in 2010 and it was clearly part of our policy in 2013. We think that paid parental leave is a workplace entitlement in the same way that sick pay, holiday pay and long service leave are workplace entitlements. Because paid parental leave is a workplace entitlement, it should be paid at the real wage of the relevant worker. Members of the opposition maybe caterwauling, but business will be paying for it through a modest levy to be imposed on the 3,000 largest businesses in our country.

  It is hugely important to repeal the mining tax. The mining tax represents sovereign risk to potential investors in Australia. It has been a disastrous tax from its very inception. The mining tax has been one of the great financial disasters of modern times. In its original form it was meant to raise $12Â½ billion in this current financial year, but it has barely raised a dollar. The most insidious part of all this is that the Labor Party committed $16 billion of expenditure against a tax that raises no money. They were spending money they were never going to receive. That is the fraud the Labor Party has imposed on the Australian people, including the people of Western Australia who rely so heavily on the resources and mining industry. The Labor Party are the architects of the worst tax in modern times; a tax that hits everyday Western Australians and everyday Australians. It is a terrible tax. Yesterday, I said in 100 years time they will be writing about the mining tax as the worst tax that was ever designed. I did not know how apt it was for me to make that reference at the time, so I went back to the budget papers of a hundred years ago.                   The member for Gorton then left the chamber.                     The mining tax, designed by the member for Lilley, actually raised 95 per cent less than was forecast. In 1914, it was also a Labor Prime Minister and Treasurer, Andrew Fisher, who designed a tax for the introduction of probate and succession duties that was meant to raise one million pounds but raised just 39,000 pounds - 96 per cent less than what was forecast. So Labor introducing a tax raising no money seems to be a once in a hundred years event. But I bet Andrew Fisher did not have the hide to spend money he never received.

  Madam Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is humming Rule Britannia across the table when in fact what happened yesterday was the restoration of knighthoods and damehoods in the Order of Australia. That is what happened. So I say to the honourable Bill Shorten - a title derived from the United Kingdom -                      I say to the honourable the Leader of the Opposition - a title derived from Britain - I say to the honourable the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition: start telling the truth. Start telling the truth for a change.                 Now, not one of the smears and slurs contained in the Leader of the Opposition's statement -                    The member for Kingsford Smith then left the chamber.                     because it was not a question; it was a statement - not one of them is true. I will tell you what our priorities are.                   The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     Our priorities are helping Australian families by scrapping the carbon tax. Labor wants the carbon tax to stay. Our priorities are helping Australian jobs by scrapping the mining tax. Labor wants the mining tax to stay. Our priorities are restoring peace in our workplaces by restoring the ABCC. Labor wants the ABCC to go.                      Our priorities are those of the Australian people. What the Australian people want is less tax, less regulation, more freedom and more prosperity, and that is what they will get from this government.

  You know, as the days go on, I miss Peter Garrett more and more. He was the one, of course, who acknowledged that at least he had a short memory. This is the crossbencher, and this is the opposition, that in government took a real axe to the Australian way of life. They are the people who imposed a tax of $550 a year, when they went to an election saying that they would not. If you worry about Australian life, the first thing that you would worry about is truth in government. Truth in government would be fundamental.                     What we heard throughout the course of the last term was a government built on a fundamental deception. As the member for Melbourne would remember, the opposition, when they were in government, went to the election pledging that there would be no carbon tax under the government they led. They pledged there would be no carbon tax.                     In terms of the Australian way of life, starting with truth in government, starting with your commitments, starting with the fundamental contract with the Australian people would be an absolute essential for good governance in this country. The member for Melbourne struck a compact which caused the government of the day to breach their fundamental pact with the Australian people. Do you know the worst thing about it? Apart from the fact that it was a $550 tax, apart from the fact that it was an increase in electricity prices, apart from the fact that it was an increase in gas prices, it did not do the job on climate change. If you want to have an impact you would think that you would actually want to reduce emissions. The latest figures are that after a multibillion- dollar tax the decrease in Australia's emissions - these are not our figures - was 0.1 per cent from this great tax over the first year. So a multibillion-dollar tax, with a $550 a year impact on Australian families, came at the cost of a fundamental compact between Australian families, Australian pensioners, Australian voters and the government of the day.                  We are concerned about protecting Australian families. We are going to take actions which actually reduce our emissions, rather than a 0.1 per cent impact from a multibillion-dollar tax. I welcome this question from the member for Melbourne - come on down with more - but at the end of the day, if you want to do something for the Australian way of life, stand up for truth and stand up for the compact between the Australian people and the government.

  You are a genius - just a genius. We have a new Mensa!                   The member for Charlton then left the chamber.                     I can understand why the member for O'Connor would want to know why a $550-a-year hit on Australian families has not been repealed and why the opposition would stand in the way of repealing something which they themselves have said they would want to terminate. It is a very interesting story this, because on the weekend, on Sunday morning, I was watching one of Labor's luminaries and guiding lights being interviewed. Here is what the interviewer said to this luminary: 'Explain this: I just cannot understand why Bill Shorten would defend a carbon tax for which Labor had no mandate and which it promised to get rid of. Why would you do something that idiotic?' 'Well,' says Bruce Hawker, 'it defeats me somewhat. I think one of the very few decent things about losing an election is you can say: 'All right, that's over. The electorate got it right and now we're focusing on the future.' I am lost for words as to why we'd do it.'                   The member for Griffith then left the chamber.                     Just to repeat Bruce Hawker: 'I am lost for words as to why we'd do it.' But why do they do it? The answer is very simple. They said one thing before the election - they said they would terminate the carbon tax - and did the other thing afterwards. Interestingly, Prime Minister, they said one thing in Western Australia only last Thursday - their leading Senate candidate said they were going to scrap the carbon tax - and did another thing in Canberra four hours later.                 In terms of what they said before the election, let us remember that Kevin Rudd said, 'We will terminate the carbon tax.' He was flanked by the member for Port Adelaide, who went on to say, 'Labor supports terminating the carbon tax.' But they did not. He was flanked by the member for McMahon, who, very interestingly, on the cost of living said, 'We think this is an appropriate thing to do in the face of cost-of-living pressures faced by the Australian people' - and he was right. A $550 a year cost-of-living pressure, a nine per cent decrease in electricity prices, a seven per cent decrease in tax, a decrease in refrigerant costs - these are the things which will come from repealing the carbon tax.                 In terms of Western Australia, what is very interesting is that the Western Australian Senate candidate Louise Pratt said in the Senate, 'We are committed to scrapping the carbon tax,' and then they voted to keep the carbon tax. We have had Joe Bullock, their leading Senate candidate, make the statement only last Thursday that Labor is scrapping the carbon tax. So they say one thing in Western Australia in the morning, and four hours later they do the other thing here in Canberra. When it comes to the carbon tax, you cannot trust Labor, but you can trust the coalition.

  Well, Madam Speaker, this is -                      This is a government which is capable of doing several things at the same time. But our priority is lifting the burdens on Australian families, and last week we tried to scrap the carbon tax, and Labor made the carbon tax stay. Yesterday we tried to scrap the mining tax, and Labor made the mining tax stay. We are trying to clean up the building and construction industry; Labor is trying to stop that. We are trying to get rid of union rorts, rackets and rip-offs, and corruption of the sort that the former member for Dobell was engaged in; Labor is still protecting that kind of wrongdoing. These are our priorities; I am proud of them.

  I thank the member for Canning for his question. I am happy to tell him that, in fact, there is much to be proud of in the Western Australian school education system, and, if the voters of Western Australia on 5 April return enough coalition senators to make sure that the Senate is a workable Senate for the government, we will be able to continue to support the Western Australian government in the good work that they are doing for school students in improving their outcomes.                 Contrary to the shadow minister's wrong assertions and her misinformation, the Western Australian state government have increased their spending on schools by 7.8 per cent this financial year. In fact, Western Australia has the highest level of funding per student in a government school of any state or territory in the country. In fact, Western Australia leads the country in school autonomy, with independent public schools giving more autonomy for principals, which we know improves the outcomes for students - so much so that Queensland and the Northern Territory are following their lead - and this is paying off, because they have the best results in the latest PISA data.                 The best results in Australia are in Western Australia in science, maths and reading. In all three of the things that PISA tests, Western Australia is leading the nation. So they are themselves investing in their schools rather than demanding Canberra does so, they are introducing independent public schools, and we are helping them with a more robust curriculum and with an independent public schools policy to expand independent public schools, and by putting $120 million back into Western Australian schools that the Leader of the Opposition ripped out in the PEFO - the Pre-Election Fiscal Outlook - when he was the Minister for Education. In fact, Labor ripped $1.2 billion out of schools before the federal election, but - thanks to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister - we found the money to support Western Australian education. The shadow minister cannot even be bothered turning up to question time because -                      she is in Western Australia when the parliament is sitting, continuing to spread her misinformation, her deceit and her dishonesty in Western Australia. Her job is here in Canberra, doing her job as the member for Adelaide, but she cannot be bothered. She would rather be -                      Madam Speaker, I am very proud of the record of this government in school education, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Western Australian government, which is achieving the best results in the nation through the policies that we support, like independent public schooling. I look forward to working with them in the future.

  What the opposition is attempting to do here is to spread fear in our community. The priorities of this government are clear, and for the pensioners of Australia, the priorities are very, very clear indeed. We will scrap the carbon tax and we will keep the compensation The people who are trying to prevent a benefit to pensioners are members opposite, who want the pensioners of Australia to keep paying the carbon tax. If we are talking about benefits to pensions, we want to take the carbon tax off the pensioners of Australia, and Labor is voting to keep it on them. Shame, Labor, shame! Give the pensioners of Australia a fair go by voting to take the carbon tax off their power bills.

  May I compliment the member for Durack in her representations to deliver better roads to northern Western Australia. This government has responded with a substantial program of new roads and new construction projects in the region. Indeed, about half a billion dollars is being committed to new roadworks to benefit northern Western Australia, and that includes $307 million to upgrade the Great Northern Highway and $174 million to upgrade the North West Coastal Highway. Once more, this is real money. This is money that is budgeted for and funded - unlike the commitments that were made by those opposite, which the member for Lilley and the member for Grayndler said were conditional on funding from the mining tax. Labor was talking about projects, but they were never there to deliver them, because the funds were not available - they were conditional on money coming from the mining tax. But I am sure the member for Durack and the 47 councils that she represented would have been horrified earlier this week when they saw the Labor Party and the Greens combining in this House to oppose the continuation of the Roads to Recovery program. The Roads to Recovery program is vital for upgrading local roads and local streets, especially in the large areas represented by the member for Durack.                 Labor and the Greens voted against this program. I find that just incredible. The member for Grayndler was not able to be here yesterday, but it did not stop him issuing a press release after the debate. In it he went to great lengths to say that Labor had actually funded Roads to Recovery into the future. It may have been on the expenditure side of the budget, but on the other side it was only debt.                 The reality, and one would have thought the member for Grayndler would have known this, is that Labor's 2009 legislation terminates the Roads to Recovery program on 30 June this year. Their legislation terminates the Roads to Recovery program. This legislation is absolutely essential to implementing this side of the House's commitment to five more years of Roads to Recovery funding.                 The councils of Australia need to be aware that if Labor and the Greens combine in the Senate to vote against this legislation again then there will be no Roads to Recovery program. There will be no vital funding to support their roadworks and street works around the country. It is a clear choice. You vote for senators who will approve the Roads to Recovery program if you want this vital program to continue.

  I certainly support efforts by the Treasurer to work with the states to improve the infrastructure of our country. That is what the Treasurer is doing. The Treasurer is working with the states to try and ensure that together the state governments and the Commonwealth government have the assets needed to fund the infrastructure that Australia needs.                 We want to ensure that we get the roads, the rail and the ports that this country needs. We want the infrastructure of the 21st century, because I want to be known as the infrastructure Prime Minister. In order for us to be the infrastructure national government, led by the infrastructure Prime Minister, we have to work with the states. Now, if we can help the states -                      If we can help the states to deploy resources from a lesser priority to a higher priority, that is a very smart thing to do. The resources of this nation, whether they are held by national or state governments, should be optimally deployed. That means rebuilding our infrastructure and unclogging the great economic arteries of this country. That is what this government wants to do. Frankly, if members opposite had any sense whatsoever they would support it.

  I thank the honourable member for her question -                      The Abbott government inherited a shocking mess in the NBN everywhere in Australia, but nowhere worse than in Western Australia. At the time of the election there were only 75 premises in the whole state connected to the broadband network.                     Members opposite said that since the election the coalition has stopped the rollout of the NBN. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that in Western Australia there are not 5,482 premises connected to the fibre, which if my calculations are correct is an increase of 7,300 per cent on the Labor Party's effort. There are also now 34,582 premises that are actually serviceable.                     I spoke yesterday in the House about the colossal failure in the Interim Satellite Service - 5,600 residents who use that service are only getting dial-up, at a cost to the taxpayer of $7,300 each. I talked about how we are seeking to remedy that. Another matter we have been left with, which is a shocking and extremely difficult to solve mess, is the fact there are over 16,000 premises in Western Australia alone in areas that were promised broadband delivered by fixed wireless. The NBN Co, at the time those promises were made and now, does not own the radio frequency spectrum capable of delivering that service. So that was a complete falsehood. It was a totally false promise. The Conrovian promise had no basis at all. It was a complete fantasy. We are working on a solution to that. As I have said many times the messes that Senator Conroy left us are not susceptible to easy solutions. He is a master at making difficult messes for his successors. Yesterday the former deputy chair Diane Smith-Gander was asked about Senator Conroy. She was asked if the former board had recommended that he conduct a cost-benefit analysis, and she said -                      I am really surprised that one of Her Majesty's counsels, learned in the law, would not have been able to pick that up. But Diane Smith-Gander said, 'think about the notion of suggesting anything to Minister Conroy'.                     I am a committed republican, but I did not see you on the barricades. You were missing in action.                     You were missing in action!

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. In answering it, I would like to refer to a speech today by the Leader of the Opposition at the Press Club. I want to quote from a section that was 7Â½ minutes in. You may have already switched off by then and you may not have picked it up. Maybe the member for Lilley had switched over to MasterChef. They were doing reruns on ONE HD. This is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say:                 I do not look at policy through the prism of left-wing or right-wing ideology  -  I'm interested in what works _                 I am pleased to let the Leader of the Opposition know that Operation Sovereign Borders is working. I can back that up by referring to the comparative performances of those who sat in the role of ministers for immigration under the previous government, and I referred the House to this last week. Under the previous government, the largest number of cumulative days achieved by previous ministers for immigration where there was no successful venture to Australia was 61 for Senator Evans, for the member for McMahon it was 23 days, for the member for Gorton it was just six days - he could not get through a week - and the now Manager of Opposition Business could only get six days as well.                 What is interesting about that is if you lay all of that failure end to end, from one end of failure to the other end of failure, it is 96 days. If you add all of their cumulative efforts together, it is 96 days. I fear that the only honour those on that side of the House who served in that role would qualify for is services to people smuggling. Compare their record of 96 days cumulative to this side of the House. We have 97 days and - guess what? - we did it with one minister, one Prime Minister and just six months in office. For those on the other side, it was 96 days. They had three prime ministers, they were in there for 5Â½ years after their failures and they had four ministers, three of them in just six months.                 I am asked about the support for these policies. The support for the coalition's consistent approach over the years has principally been from those who came to Australia the right way. Those who came to this country the right way were offended and remain offended by the failure of the previous government's policies that rewarded those who came to Australia the wrong way and continued to penalise those who sought to come the right way. People who came to this country where everything was offered and who had to ask for nothing were all the beneficiaries. Those opposite gave the green light to illegal entry to this country for six years and they should be ashamed of themselves.

  The fact is our numbers tell the truth and Labor's did not. Labor's last attack on costings did not go too well. Remember the election campaign? Remember Labor came out and attacked our costings? I have another book from the library. I am becoming quite the accomplished library customer.                     I cite this book by Bruce Hawker; The Rudd Rebellion it is titled. It says: 'When Rudd, Bowen and Wong held a joint press conference attacking the opposition costings' - that is our costings - 'and in doing so used out of date information, the response by the Treasury and Finance department CEOs was devastating. They said it was an invalid comparison and suddenly our costings attack on the opposition was in tatters.' So that was Bruce Hawker. And I thought to myself: surely Labor would learn the lesson that, if they are attacking our numbers, they have to be credible. Of course, the credibility of the Labor Party was lost when on more than 300 occasions they promised to deliver a surplus and they never did. I came across the budget newsletter from Bill Shorten MP. And it says here -                      This is his newsletter and it says 'Moonee Ponds', and it has got a nice photo - a much younger looking Bill Shorten, I might say. This is Labor. It says, 'This budget - '                     And, of course, the newsletter from the now Leader of the Opposition said:                 This budget ensures that the benefits of the boom are spread to all corners of our country. We have brought the budget back to surplus on time, as promised _                     And just in case you missed it on the front page, it is on the back page as well.                     'Back in surplus on time, as promised. We have delivered a surplus on time, as promised.' Now, the Labor Party has been out in the last 24 hours talking about their budget rules, suggesting that if we kept to their budget rules we would have the budget coming back in surplus. The problem is that Labor never kept to their budget rules. Therefore, they never delivered surplus.                     They would never deliver a surplus. They have no economic credibility. They got every single number wrong, and they left the Australian people to pick up the bill from a very bad Labor government.

  Because it is your deficit - $123 billion of Labor deficit! And the numbers tell the truth.                     Let us be very, very clear: this is the last economic statement from the member -                    The member for McMahon then left the chamber.                     That has just increased the IQ of the Labor Party.                     And if the member for Lilley goes out, that will double the IQ of the Labor Party. The bottom line is the Labor Party -                      The Labor Party and the member for Lilley must be incredibly proud of the legacy. It was the member for Lilley that promised a surplus.                     If economic performance is based on actually delivering a surplus, the Labor Party failed at every count. It was the member for Lilley that delivered a $27 billion deficit, then a $54 billion deficit, then a $47 billion deficit, then a $43 billion deficit -                      So he must be immensely proud of his record of $190 billion of deficits. You are a winner, old Swannie!                     What an incredibly proud moment it must have been for the member for Lilley to have overseen, as Treasurer, every single year in deficit and then to have left a legacy of $123 billion of deficit and $667 billion of deficit.                     How about throwing him out?                   The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                     The member for Lilley is a genius! He should have been the world's worst Treasurer, because that was the decision of the Australian people. There was one consistent theme across the whole Rudd-Gillard government. It was that Wayne Swan was the Treasurer. The member for Lilley was the Treasurer. He was unquestionably the worst Treasurer. He designed taxes that never raised any money, he kept chopping and changing policy and he left a legacy that we have to fix. Well, we are determined to fix the budget, we are determined to undertake the repair job, we are determined to grow the Australian economy and we are determined to help the Australian enterprises and businesses out there to create the jobs of the 21st century.

  Our priority is scrapping the carbon tax and boosting family income by $550 a year. Our priority is scrapping the mining tax and boosting investment and jobs right around Australia. Our priority is restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission and adding $6 billion a year to our economy and productivity improvements. Our priority is stopping the boats - and it is working. And, on all of these grave matters for the security and the prosperity of our country, we are being opposed by members opposite.

  I thank the member for Dobell for her question, and I wish to reassure her and all members of this House that this government's absolute commitment is to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. We are scrapping bad taxes, we are building the roads of the 21st century, we are finalising free trade agreements with our major trading partners, and we are restoring a sustainable budget surplus by ending Labor's waste. And isn't it so necessary to end Labor's waste? Because this government's fiscal inheritance was cumulative deficits of $123 billion over the forward estimates period - that is 123 thousands of millions of dollars and a projected debt of $667 billion - thousands of millions of dollars.                     Labor's projected debt was going to be $23,000 for every Australian man, woman and child - that is the credit card bill for every Australian man, woman and child that the Leader of the Opposition wanted to leave us with. This government understands that you cannot fix the economy unless you fix the budget, and a stronger budget means lower taxes and more jobs. We were very up-front with the Australian people before the election: the schoolkids bonus would go, the income support bonus would go, because you cannot give what you have not got, and you cannot give away to people what you just cannot afford. And Labor's mining tax, which is supposed to support $13 billion worth of spending, was raising just $300 million. That is why these things simply cannot be afforded. We have had $20 billion in savings before the Senate - $15 billion of coalition savings, $5 billion in Labor savings - and Labor is against all of it. They just do not get it. I say that no country can ever spend its way out of economic trouble, and no government can ever spend money it has not raised.                     Tough decisions are coming, but they are necessary decisions for the prosperity of our country. We will keep our commitments, and the most fundamental commitment of all is to restore the budget.

  I just want to deal head-on with this great fiction. The Labor Party's record was $190 billion of deficits in five years. I know that the member for Lilley is hurting about that, because he promised there would be a surplus. In fact, they all promised there would be a surplus. There was no surplus. There is no surplus. In fact, the legacy of Labor is that over the next 10 years there is no surplus, there is no repayment of debt. So, as you can see, the Labor party legacy of debt and deficit was not just for the period they were in government; it is for as far as you can see in the years ahead - $667 billion. Labor's legacy out of all of that - which they are in denial about - is that they left an economic environment with deteriorating terms of trade, with rising unemployment, and with below trend growth. Labor's legacy was 200,000 more Australians unemployed between the time they went into government and the time they left government.                 Labor's legacy in relation to economic reform was to impose more regulation on Australian businesses. In fact Labor introduced 22,000 new regulations in just five years - and there is no sense of embarrassment.                     The problem for our opponents is that if they cannot be honest enough with themselves about what their legacy really was they will never be able to deal with the challenges of the future in an honest way. They do not get it. This is their legacy: $123 billion of deficits, $667 billion of debt, and an Australia that is not as competitive with the world as it should be. That is the Labor legacy, but they do not get it. Instead, they try to create a fictional legacy, and they repeat it and repeat it and repeat it, thinking that the Australian people are so stupid that eventually their fiction will become a truth.                 The fact is Labor were terrible economic managers. Labor were hopeless at running the economy. Labor were hopeless at running the budget.                     And, sadly, the Australian people have paid the price.

  Our plans are very clear. We have been entirely consistent for years now in dealing with what were the changing economic circumstances over the last few years and in fact the last few decades. We have been entirely consistent. We said government cannot afford to waste taxpayers' money.                     That is consistent line No.1. As soon as Labor started to roll out the pink batts - there was a pause in the interjections just now amongst Labor. The pink batts program, remember that? Gee, that was a good use of money, except that it cost lives and it was a terrible waste of money.                     And then there are the GP Super Clinics. We are hearing every day just how well that program went. Only the Labor Party could build medical facilities that do not treat any patients. Yet they still have not rolled out a full program.                     And what waste we have seen in the NBN. What a terrible and sad story - a litany of waste and incompetence associated with a bill that would have well exceeded $70 billion, if it had remained on track. The net result of all that was $667 billion of debt and $123 billion of deficits over the next four years on top of $190 billion of deficits over the last five years. That $190 billion worth of deficits over the last five years is the equivalent of 200 major new teaching hospitals across the country.                 What are we going to do? We are going to fix the mess. Tough decisions will have to be made, because sooner or later the truth about the budget was going to be out. The record of Labor is rich.                     But we have a plan that focuses on growth and jobs. We are putting $1.5 billion into WestConnex which will, in itself, deliver 10,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction, including hundreds of apprenticeships.                 We are focusing on other infrastructure projects, such as the East West Link in Melbourne, which is worth $1.5 billion and will have 3,500 construction jobs, and the $1 billion Gateway Motorway in Brisbane. These deliver real productivity benefits and real jobs.                 We want to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, and get rid of the corruption in the unions - how important is that? And we are going to abolish the carbon tax and the mining tax. We have a plan for jobs. Labor is reckless with the economy.

  I do thank the member for Denison for his question. I know that this is a subject that he takes very, very seriously. I know that this is a subject that we all take seriously. I accept the passion and the compassion that the member for Denison brings to this particular subject.                 None of us want to see anyone in detention. We certainly do not want to see children in detention. I can inform the member for Denison that at the end of the Howard government era there were only four people in immigration detention who had arrived illegally by boat, and none of them were children. I regret to say that in the period between that time and this time more than 50,000 people arrived illegally in Australia by boat, including 8,000 children. I deeply regret the fact that so many people, including so many children, took this very dangerous journey. Let us be blunt. The reason that the boats started coming -                      was that Labor and the Greens closed down the policies that had in the past stopped the boats.                     I am looking forward to the day when no-one is in immigration detention. That is the day I am looking forward to. The way to ensure that no-one is in immigration detention is to stop the boats. That is exactly what this government is doing. That is the way to ensure that never again do we need to put women, children and men in immigration detention because they have come illegally to this country by boat.                 The boats are stopping. I am pleased to tell the member for Denison that four detention centres have already closed because of the good work of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, and there is more good work still to come.

  I thank the honourable member for Durack for her question -                      The Australian people want us to talk about jobs, prosperity, the economy and the fate of their children. These shenanigans from these fools on the other side are simply undermining the opportunity for Australians to deal with the issues that really do matter.                     I withdraw. The fact is that Australians want us to talk about them, their jobs, their prosperity and their family budget. It is hugely important that we address these issues, because it represents the very hope of our nation that we should be in the business of creating an economy that delivers prosperity, jobs, a better tomorrow and a better quality of life than that which we have had the privilege to have. That is our job as legislators and as a government. That is our job, and that is the responsibility of this parliament. We are going to deal with those issues in a systemic and focused way. We are determined to create an economy and to deliver a budget that is focused on jobs and prosperity and that is focused on security and hope. That is what we are focused on, in the Liberal and National parties. We do so having inherited $123 billion of deficits from Labor, $667 billion of debt -                      another 200,000 Australians unemployed, deteriorating terms of trade, below trend growth and rising unemployment. These are the legacies of Labor. We are a government that has inherited systemic waste from Labor, who were still sending out $900 cheques to dead people and people overseas as part of its stimulus package, that was meant to have been in place years ago. The fact is that the Labor Party left an embedded legacy that is destroying the fabric of the budget. In the fifth year, that they never had the courage to talk about, expenditure by government increased by nearly six per cent, in one year - clearly unsustainable. This was three times what Labor promised. All of that must be dealt with now. All the way through, Labor left little time bombs. They go off at particular moments in order to cause maximum harm, not to the government but to the people of Australia. The Labor Party was determined to wreak havoc; they were reckless in government and they are proving to be reckless in opposition.

  The only people who are obsessing about honours are members opposite.                      As is well known, the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has no greater champion than me. I am John Howard's greatest champion but, in case members opposite have not noticed, this is not the fifth term of the Howard government.                   The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     The Howard government was a great government in its own way, and this government will endeavour to be a good government in our way. That is exactly what we are doing. Another respect in which this is a different government from the Howard government is that we have inherited a much worse fiscal legacy than the Howard government did.                     John Howard and Peter Costello inherited Kim Beazley's $10 billion budget black hole. If only we were so lucky - if only it was just $10 billion, not the $123 billion in cumulative deficit we have inherited.                     Peter Costello and John Howard only had $96 billion worth of Labor debt to deal with. We have got $667 billion worth of Labor debt to deal with. I am full of admiration for John Howard and Peter Costello. They were great leaders of this country, but these times are different. The challenges that we have inherited, from a much worse Labor government than the one that they succeeded, are much bigger. We will rise to these challenges, and we will fix the fiscal hole that we have inherited.                     If only he had the class of his mother-in-law, that is all I can say. On that note, I ask that further questions be left on the Notice Paper.                     Madam Speaker, obviously offence has been taken. I unconditionally withdraw.

  As everyone in this chamber and everyone viewing here and around the country knows, tonight we have a budget. It is a very, very important budget, which obviously represents the values of this government and the necessity for this government to repair the debt and deficit disaster that we were left by members opposite - by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, and his colleagues.                 I want to assure the Labor Party and all the people of Australia that we will fix the debt and deficit disaster that we were left by the Labor Party, and we will do it in ways which are faithful to the commitments we made pre-election. Let me remind members opposite that every day during the election campaign I expressed the objectives of this coalition should we be a government - we would stop the boats, we would scrap the carbon tax, we would build the roads of the 21st century and, above all else, we would bring the budget back under control. That is what this nation needs, and that is what we will deliver.

  I thank the Member for Solomon for her question, and I can assure her and all members of this parliament that this is a government that will keep its commitments. The commitments we endlessly repeated before the election were to stop the boats, to scrap the carbon tax, to build the roads of the 21st century and to bring the budget back under control. These are the commitments we made, and these are the commitments we will honour. And isn't it so necessary that we get the budget back under control? What the Labor Party and members opposite did was to leave us a legacy of debt and deficit stretching as far as the eye can see. It was inter-generational theft. That is what they left us - $123 billion in cumulative budget deficit and $667 billion in projected debt. This is the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite left us. And members opposite knew they had a problem. That is why they went to the election promising $5 billion in spending cuts that they have walked away from. They have walked away from their own scant commitments to budget responsibility. The people of Australia did not elect us to make easy decisions; they elected us to make the tough decisions. They did not elect us to be cheapskate populists; they elected us to do what is necessary for our country, and we will.                     The people of Australia understand that this country's fiscal position is simply unsustainable. Every month, this country is borrowing $1 billion - that is one thousand millions of dollars. Every single month, we are borrowing that just to pay the interest on our debt. We are borrowing to pay the interest on our borrowing. And as every single Australian out there in the real world knows, that is simply unsustainable, so we will tackle the problem. We will do it in ways that are consistent with our pre-election commitments, and we will do it in ways that set up this great country for the long term.

  I thank the Member for Flynn for his question. He knows and was part of a coalition campaign in which we committed as a government to deliver the roads for the 21st century. We undertook to build the roads and rail lines that would be necessary to build our nation's productivity and to secure our nation's future.                 The legacy we inherited from the previous government was of course pretty disappointing, well short of their rhetoric. Indeed, if you think of the last two Labor budgets, they spent $2.6 billion and $3.5 billion on roads and rail. And, of course, when they left, many projects were behind schedule or had not even started. The reality is: their performance was abysmal. When they had an opportunity to actually do some things to build the infrastructure of the 21st century - the big spend that went into their response to the global financial crisis - they did not put the money into investments that would have generated real, long-term productive benefits. Instead, they built double-priced school halls, which have done nothing to improve education outcomes in our country; they disastrously installed roof insulation, and the royal commission is hearing all about that at the present time; and they engaged in a multitude of wasteful green schemes that did nothing to enhance our economy. They wasted billions. Labor often boasted about what they spent because they did not have much to boast about when it came to delivery. It was not a government of achievement; it was a government of expenditure. Indeed, just 14 per cent of the stimulus package spent in response to the global financial crisis was spent on productivity-enhancing infrastructure - just 14 per cent - and that minor, minor share continued to deteriorate.                 Over the next couple of days, the Australian people are going to hear a lot about infrastructure, about plans for the future, about building the infrastructure that our country will need for the next century. Tonight the Treasurer will show how this government will deliver on its commitments to the Australian people to build the infrastructure that we need. That infrastructure will drive economic growth. It will slash travel times in our cities and create thousands of jobs to help build a productive future for our country.                 Leave not granted.

  I am delighted to see money being invested in public transport, and money being invested in urban rail systems should be invested by the state governments, which own and operate the urban rail systems. After tonight's budget, we will see far more opportunity for the state governments to invest in the public transport systems that they own and operate, to recycle assets from less productive to more productive assets, according to their choice. What we will see in this budget tonight is a record Commonwealth spend on infrastructure and the opportunity for the states to spend record amounts on infrastructure should they choose to do so. And don't we need it, because, thanks to neglect by state Labor governments and by the recent federal Labor government, there is an $80 billion infrastructure gap in this country. We did not create the problem, but we will take responsibility for fixing it - and the fixing starts tonight.

  I must thank the honourable member for his question. He draws attention to an appalling statistic that will overhang tonight's budget and indeed our national economy for a decade, and that is the legacy of Labor's debt. The first $1 billion that this government, or future governments, will collect in tax every month will have to be spent on paying the interest on Labor's debt. It is $1 billion that perhaps could have built a major new hospital in every capital city. It would only take six months of this interest payment and we could finish building the whole of the Pacific Highway to four lanes. Indeed, if you go back to 1974, the whole Snowy Mountains scheme cost only $1 billion to build, in 1974 numbers. Now, in today's numbers, Australian people have to pay $1 billion every month just to pay the interest on Labor's debt.                 If the Labor Party had their way, it would continue to get worse and worse. There will be savings tonight that some may not like. If we did not have to pay $1 billion in interest every month, then those savings might not have to be made. If we wanted to spend more on things of significance, if we did not have to pay that $1 billion every month on interest then there would be opportunities for us to do so much more. Labor's legacy, from six years in government, is a legacy of debt. They inherited record surpluses and turned them into record deficits, and they did it in their very first year. They took savings in the bank and turned surpluses into deficit. Labor delivered $191 billion worth of deficits in just their six years, and there would be $123 billion more in deficits in store if they were still in government.                  Our task in government is to start restoring the national economy so that we can get rid of some of that debt, so that we can spend money on the things that Australians want rather than paying the debts of the disgraceful administration that was cast out of office at the last election. Unless we take action tonight, the gross debt will rise to $667 billion. That is a debt, for every Australian, of almost $25,000 per person. What a legacy Labor has left behind! Now it is our turn to have to correct, once again, the legacy of Labor's debt and deficit and to get our country moving forward once again.

  I am certainly happy to repeat that we are about getting rid of taxes. We want to start by getting rid of the carbon tax and the mining tax. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to make keeping commitments his theme; why is the Leader of the Opposition so keen to talk about keeping commitments while his senators prevent the government from keeping the most important commitment of all - the commitment to get rid of the carbon tax? Why won't this Leader of the Opposition allow this government to keep its commitment to abolish the carbon tax?                     We are going to honour our commitments. We are particularly going to honour our commitment to repeal the carbon tax. I respectfully suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he would have a lot more credibility on the subject of keeping commitments if his senators were not standing in the way of the repeal of the carbon tax and a $550 a year benefit to every household in this country. What a fraud this Leader of the Opposition is to talk about keeping commitments when his senators are standing in the way of this government keeping its commitments. Now, the Leader of the Opposition has asked, 'Is this government going to cut taxes?' Yes, this government is going to cut the tax burden. As a result of decisions that this government has taken, the tax burden will be $5.7 billion less - thanks to this government.

  I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question. I acknowledge that many of the issues he raised in his question are important, they are important to our nation and they will be important in tonight's budget. If he can fit it into his busy schedule to actually be present this evening to hear the budget, he will hear a response to each of the particular issues he has raised.                 The first question was in relation to household electricity pricing. In tonight's budget, you may not be surprised to hear, we intend to deliver the end of the carbon tax. The end of the carbon tax means lower electricity prices. It will make a difference to all Australians, and I trust that the member for Kennedy will join the members on this side of the House, when it comes to a vote or when it goes to a vote in the Senate, to make sure that the majority of the people in the House actually deliver those cheaper electricity promises that we will be committing to in tonight's budget.                  The member for Kennedy referred also to the role of ethanol in the nation's fuel mix. We have been supportive of the ethanol industry in the past, and the budget tonight will be fair also to the ethanol industry. We are working very closely to ensure that our economy works efficiently, that we deliver better infrastructure - I might add, including in the member for Kennedy's electorate - and that will help to make our economy work better. That will give a better opportunity to our farmers also to be able to get their products to the market in the cheapest and most effective way.                 Then the member spoke about the real challenges that farm incomes face. The Minister for Agriculture will be talking tonight about the fulfilment of our election commitments to the agricultural sector which will help build a better future for agriculture. In relation to so many of these issues about farm income, members will also be interested, in tonight's budget, to hear reports of the successful negotiation by the minister for trade of new free trade agreements with some of the best markets in the world - the markets that can deliver the best possible returns to Australian farmers.                 So there will be good news in tonight's budget as well. There are some tough decisions that have to be made; but there is good news which will deliver real benefits to people who live in regional Australia and help ensure that our economy grows more strongly in the future.

  I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. I can tell him that we are addressing the poor results of Australian school students that we inherited from the previous government. We did it, to begin with, by putting the $1.2 billion back into the school funding model that the Leader of the Opposition took out in the dying days of the previous government. So that Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland would be treated fairly, we put $1.2 billion back into the school funding model, which means that we are actually putting more money into school education than Labor would have if they had been re-elected. We are also moving to address the key issues that affect the outcomes for students - parental engagement, teacher quality, a robust curriculum and more autonomy for principals - because the research indicates that they are the most important determinants of good outcomes for our school students, with the most important being teacher quality. I can assure the House that we are listening to the PISA results that were released last December, which showed that under Labor we recorded our worst ever results in all fields of science, maths and reading and that Australia under the previous government was ranked lower than it has ever been ranked for school results.                 I was asked what we inherited. We inherited a litany of wasteful programs. The computers in schools program was supposed to cost $1 billion; it cost $2.4 billion - just pin money for the Labor Party and a mere accounting error. It was a $1.4 billion blow-out. It gets worse than that, Madam Speaker: under the Building the Education Revolution - everything under Labor had to have a historic name or be revolutionary and be the biggest ever - $16.4 billion was spent on school halls. There was no research to indicate that spending $16.4 billion on school halls would improve the outcomes for our students and yet the estimate is that between $6 billion and $8 billion of that money was wasted on overpriced school halls. The University of New England said:                 The BER program basically ticks all the boxes of what not to do. From mismanaging massive amounts of taxpayers' money, delivering (or not delivering) infrastructure that fails to meet even the most basic tests of quality of usefulness_                  That is the legacy of the previous government. We are moving to fix that. We are focusing on things that will improve the outcomes for students in tonight's budget and, best of all, we are putting the money back that Labor ripped out in the dying days of their government.

  If it is a broken promise, it is only because we are spending more. We are putting back the $1.2 billion that members opposite, led by the now Leader of the Opposition, ripped out of the forward estimates in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook statement. There we are: they ripped off $1.2 billion and they ripped off Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory -                      They are very touchy, Madam Speaker.                      We will end up spending more over the relevant forward estimates period than Labor because we put back in the $1.2 billion that Labor ripped out. This is a government which was elected to fix the debt and deficit disaster that we inherited, and fix it we will. It ill becomes members opposite to complain about the fire brigade when they are the fire. They are the fire; we will put it out.

  I thank the member for Casey for his question. This government is doing what we said we would do on our borders, and we are getting the results that we said we would get - results which those opposite and others said could not be achieved and which those opposite had given up on. We on this side of House knew in our bones that this could be done and that by applying the right policies in the right hands with the right resolve we would get this job done. And we are getting it done sustainably. For the last 20 weeks, 145 days, there has not been a single, successful maritime people-smuggling venture to Australia - not one.                 The last two ministers from among those opposite could not manage a week without a successful people-smuggling venture. Over the same period of 20 weeks there were 135 such successful ventures under the previous government and there were 8,946 illegal arrivals over that period. We know what that cost in terms of lives lost, sadly. We know what the cost was to those who were denied visas, who had to wait because those opposite were handing out visas hand over fist to people arriving illegally by boat. We also know the cost to the budget was a blow-out of $11Â½ billion, and that was because of their border failures. Tonight's budget will save $2Â½ billion because of our border protection successes to date. That is what the taxpayer will be saved by getting it right on our borders. That will be achieved in addition to the savings from closing the detention centres that the previous government opened. They went on a 'building the detention centre revolution' when they were in government, and it was fuelled by their border failures. They opened them week after week, bed after bed, centre after centre. Well, we are closing them, and we are closing those centres whether they are in Inverbrackie or Darwin or Curtin - the Curtin centre that they opened and said they would never expand that they expanded to record levels.                 I can understand why those opposite are embarrassed by their border failures and dare not speak about them. What I cannot understand is why they hold onto them so tightly. Why do they hold onto the policies that failed under their government and continue to reject the policies of this government, policies that are working? I have a message for them. It comes from the latest Disney movie, Frozen. They are frozen in time. The message is simply this: 'Let it go, Bill - those policies have failed and it is time to let them go.'

  People will see in the budget tonight that this is a government which has kept its commitments. This is a government which has kept its commitments. That is what people will see in the budget tonight. The most fundamental commitment of all was to get the budget back under control - to end the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite left us. It ill becomes members opposite to keep talking about commitments when they are trying to stop us keeping the most fundamental commitment of all, the commitment to abolish the carbon tax and save the families of this country $550 every single year.                      If the Leader of the Opposition takes commitments seriously, what about allowing us to honour our commitment to end the carbon tax and to do the right thing by the people of Australia?

  I thank the honourable member for her question and her interest in health matters and providing health services to her electorate. There has been an important development in the GP superclinic program. I want to update the House and the Australian people on what is a very important outcome in the GP superclinic program, but I will come to that in just a moment.                 This is a program which, along with the creation of 12 great big new bureaucracies in health, will be hanging around the necks of the Labor Party for a generation to come. This program was a complete, outrageous waste of taxpayers' money - $650 million was spent on the GP superclinic program. They only opened half the number they promised. Some of them are still vacant paddocks six or seven years later - not seeing a patient, not even having started construction. They were set up in competition - using money borrowed on behalf of taxpayers - with existing GP practices. That is how bad this policy was. They diverted money away from important health services and put it into this new health bureaucracy.                 But let me come back to the major development. During the break, the Leader of the Opposition was with the shadow health minister at the opening of the West Melbourne GP superclinic - four years after it was promised, so in itself not a bad achievement!                     So there was the Leader of the Opposition and there was the shadow health minister. They were at this grand opening of the West Melbourne GP superclinic. It had cost $15 million for that GP superclinic, which was set up to compete with other doctors' practices in the immediate region - not adding to doctor numbers or increasing the number of patient services to be provided. For $15 million, what did you get? For $15 million, surely you got some significant health services? One GP - just one GP for $15 million of borrowed money! This was after the Labor Party had run out of money and was borrowing money to pump into this program, a program which was going to compete with and cannibalise existing GP services.                  Let me make this prediction: tonight we will reform the health system to make sure we strengthen Medicare going forward, to make sure we can put health -

  I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I look forward to coming to his electorate in Brisbane to open the Mother Duck childcare centre in Wynnum next Monday. Last week I had the pleasure of announcing the largest ever government investment in the professional development of the long day care educators of this country - $200 million allocated to helping long day care services to meet the cost of upskilling to comply with new quality framework rules, to train educators, to backfill, to buy resources and to support our centres and our educators who work so hard.                 Where did this money come from, you might ask? This money came from Labor's Early Years Quality Fund.                      That is right; the Early Years Quality Fund - the fund that was not about the early years, was not about quality but was in fact a slush fund used for union recruitment, something that was shut down after our independent inquiry found that that was exactly what it was. So I am pleased to report on our centres, particularly those in rural and regional areas and particularly when it comes to employing an early childhood teachers. The cost of that is high and we need to train our educators. We need to upskill our educators so that they can do the job they do with children, with the next generation. This is a fund that will help the entire sector, not just Labor's chosen few. Remember the Early Years Quality Fund - 15 per cent: just one in six of every single educator across the country could ever have benefited.                  This fund will help every single educator in long day care. It will not be first in, first served. It will not be signed off on in a flurry of secret deals with the union behind closed doors before it is announced just before the election. It will be open and transparent. In fact, fact sheets and details are on the website - something the previous minister could never do. She could never say what she was doing. She could never communicate with the Australian people. Most importantly, it will add to the quality of teaching, the quality of child care and the quality of early learning. Centres will be able to choose how they use the money. They will not be told what to do. They will be able to use it in a way that can best provide for their educators and for families and their children.                  So I am very proud to be announcing this fund today. Applications open from next Monday, the 19th. I look forward, as the CEO of Mother Duck said, to greatly improving skills, to helping with the implementation of the quality framework and to positive outcomes for children.

  As members opposite will discover soon enough tonight, this is a budget which keeps faith with the commitments that we have made to the Australian people, and the most fundamental commitment of all is to get the budget back under control. Let us not for a second -                      The situation that this government finds itself in is that we are confronting debt and deficit stretching as far as the eye can see. I can understand why members opposite are upset about the fire brigade - because they are the fire. We did not create this problem, but the people elected us to fix it. That is what the people did, and fix it we will. And we will fix it in ways which are fair and faithful to the pre-election commitments that we made.

  The important thing is to ensure that government makes the investments that are necessary to ensure that our health system is sustainable and that cures and treatments are better in the future than they have been in the past. I think there are some tough decisions about health in this budget. There certainly are some tough decisions about health in this budget, but what this budget does include is massive investment in better health for all Australians and for people around the world in the years and the decades to come.                      If the shadow minister is looking for good sense when it comes to health policy, she ought to talk to the shadow Assistant Treasurer -                      who certainly did make good sense on this issue in times past.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and note that, in his state of Tasmania, the Labor Party's utterly catastrophic mismanagement of the NBN had reached such a point that, months before the election, construction had completely ceased. Nothing was happening at all. Indeed, $7 billion was spent as at the time of the election and the project was less than three per cent complete.                  The reason so many Australians have such inadequate broadband is that nothing was done by Labor other than to spend $7 billion and connect a handful of people in six years - six wasted years, which should have seen real action, real progress and people being upgraded to competitive speeds. Nothing happened while Labor talked about broadband. This was the most wasteful project of the Labor Party in government.                  This is what we are doing: we are getting this project back on track. Already, more than twice as many Australians are actively connected to the fibre network today as were at the election. The rollout is accelerating. We have the project back on track in Tasmania.                     As far as affordability is concerned - and this is a vital issue because broadband in Australia is expensive relative to other countries; the honourable member's point is absolutely right - if Labor had been allowed to continue the project on their plans, Australians would have had to pay up to 80 per cent more of the already high prices in order to pay for what would have been a $73 billion project - $30 billion more than they told Australians it would cost.                     We will complete this project sooner and at considerably less cost. It will cost $32 billion less and it will be done sooner. The mix of technologies we will use are consistent with the approach being taken by major telcos - Deutsche Telekom, British Telecom, AT&amp;T, Swisscom, Belgacom. The NBN today is being run for the first time by competent telecom professionals -                      a board of experienced people, and a chief executive who has actually built and run telecom networks.                     And it is being managed for the first time in a businesslike fashion. We cannot recover all of the years lost by Labor or many of the billions lost by Labor, but we are cleaning up the NBN mess as we are cleaning up the rest of Labor's mess.

  Members opposite, the Labor Party, will know everything that we have done and they will know all of the measures that we have taken to address the debt and deficit disaster that the Labor Party has left to this great nation of ours - they will know it all - at about 7.30 this evening. The Australian people will be able to make a judgement of us and the actions that we have taken to address the debt and deficit disaster that Labor has left us. But the Australian people know this: that no government can go on borrowing $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on the borrowings. No government can go on doing that. That is the unsustainable situation that this opposition - formerly the government - left us.                  I, every day in the election campaign, was open and upfront with the Australian people. I said exactly what we were going to do. What we are going to do is get the budget back under control. We are going to get the budget back under control; that is what we were elected to do. And we will not let the Australian people down.

  I was able to hear. I would like to thank the member for McPherson, who has come to this place with a tremendously successful career in small business, and brought that to her judgement on these matters. I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition has today taken an interest in mandates, taxes and the cost of living - because it is a little bit overdue. If the Leader of the Opposition is interested in mandates, taxes and the cost of living, he can get the trifecta in one hit. That one hit is to repeal the carbon tax. You can repeal the carbon tax.                 We have had all of this confected indignation today. 'I am terribly concerned,' says the Leader of the Opposition, 'about cost of living. And I am terribly concerned about taxes. And I am terribly concerned about mandates,' except when it comes to the carbon tax. So there is a way forward for the Leader of the Opposition. If he has any semblance of commitment to any of the concepts which he has suddenly discovered today, he can chat to his senators. Instead, what is happening at the moment is that he is telling his senators to stand in the way of a $7.6 billion -                      Our policy is to abolish the carbon tax; yours is to keep it. That is a pretty significant difference. We have here the confected indignation of 'Mr Mandate'. Now he is telling us that keeping mandates is so important. If it means anything, start with the central point on which this government were elected and allow us to abolish the carbon tax. This tax, as the member for McPherson set out, is a $7.6 billion hit on Australian industry and Australian families. If you are worried about families, worry about the $550 which you, the Leader of the Opposition, could relieve them of each and every year going forward. You could do that right now. Speak to your senators and, if you want to give us the passage to repeal them, we will bring back the carbon tax bills this week. Our policy is to repeal the carbon tax; your policy is to break your election commitment to terminate the carbon tax. Your policy is to stand in the way of our mandate to abolish the carbon tax. We can save Australian firms $7.6 billion. We can save Australian families $550 a year. We can reduce the cost of living. We can improve Australian competitiveness. All we need is for the Leader of the Opposition to give the word.

  The short answer is, no, of course we did not. We told the Australian people that we would tackle the debt and deficit disaster which the Labor Party created, which the Leader of the Opposition - the kingmaker, queenmaker and manipulator of the former government - created. That is what we said. We told the Australian people that we would tackle the debt and deficit disaster that the Labor Party left this country, that we would tackle the intergenerational theft that the Labor Party practised on the people of this country. That is what we said we would tackle, and we are up for it. We were not elected to make easy decisions; we were elected to make tough decisions. We were not elected to be populist; we were elected to do what is right and necessary for this country.                 I will gladly submit the budget that the Treasurer of this country will bring down tonight to the judgement of the people of Australia, because the people of Australia will know that this is a government which is up for the challenges of the day. This is a government which is prepared to confront the big decisions that it faces. This is a government which is prepared to enable the Australian people to be as great as we can be. That means fixing up the debt and deficit disaster because, if you do not fix the budget, you cannot fix the economy. Without a strong economy, we cannot be the strong society that every Australian wants to live in. I am very, very confident that when the Australian people see the budget tonight there will be some things that they like and there will be other things that they do not like. But they will know that the adults are back in charge and that they have a government that is capable of rising to the challenges of these times.

  I did not say that.                     What was that? You withdraw.                     The interviewer asked me a question and put a whole lot of things into that question and assumed that the answer was relevant to that particular point.                     The Labor Party left Australia in a mess. The Labor Party left the budget in a mess. The Labor Party is now in a position where not only are they opposing us keeping our election promises in the Senate; the Labor Party is opposing us keeping the Labor Party's election promises in the Senate. So I would say to the Labor Party that, at a certain point, you need to accept responsibility for your actions.                     If, as the member for McMahon says, the question is about deceit, I would ask him to explain why we ended up with a deficit of $123 billion. I would ask him why we ended up with $667 billion of debt. Why is it the case that the member for Lilley never actually delivered four surpluses in a row? Why is that the case? If we are going to have a discussion about deceit, I would suggest that the Labor Party is standing on very thin ice.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I acknowledge that she represents decent, aspirational people who know what it is like to put aside money today for tomorrow. She represents decent, aspirational people who know what it is like to make sacrifices for their children and for their grandchildren's future.                 As the member for Robertson knows and as I suspect most of her constituents would understand, this is a budget that is tough but fair. It is a budget that asks for sacrifices from everyone to secure the long-term future of our country, because we simply could not go on as we were when members opposite were in charge. We simply could not go on paying the mortgage on the credit card, because that is exactly what happened when the Labor Party was in government.                 The sad and tragic truth is that when the Labor Party were in charge they brought down six budgets, and those budgets gave us the six biggest deficits in our history. Sure, they forecast surpluses. They promised surpluses, but what they gave us were the six biggest deficits in our history. They did not just give us six deficits; they gave us a further four deficits in prospect. They gave us deficits and debt stretching out as far as the eye can see - $123 billion worth of prospective deficits and $667 billion worth of projected debt. Not only did they give us that; they gave us a double-dip deficit, because in 2017-18 the deficit went up again to $30 billion.                 We did not create this problem, but we will take responsibility for fixing it. We bring the budget close to surplus in 2017-18. We get the budget back under control, which is exactly what we promised we would do before the election. We are not just restraining spending; we are building for the future with the world's biggest medical research fund and with the Commonwealth's biggest ever infrastructure spend. In 1996 a coalition government brought in a budget that was tough but fair and set our country up for a decade of prosperity - and last night's budget is in exactly that tradition.

  No. I will tell you why. We went to the last election saying, as the Prime Minister said, that taxes will be lower under the coalition than under Labor. The fact of the matter is that there is a wonderful graph in the budget papers that clearly shows that, as a result of the decisions we have taken since we have come to government, tax collections are lower than they would have been if Labor were re-elected. The thing about Labor is that they are experts when it comes to tax and deceit. Exhibit A was the mining tax. That was the benchmark success for taxation reform laid down by the member for Lilley. He is a very gifted man, the member for Lilley. He manages to introduce a tax that raises no money. That is quite an achievement. In the case of the Labor Party, they promised 'There would be no carbon tax under the government I lead', and then they go and do a deal with the Greens. There was no higher purpose for introducing a carbon tax. The money was not going to go to something that was going to build a stronger nation.                     The fact of the matter is that Labor only ever introduced new taxes for political purposes. That is what they did. That was their benchmark. The biggest criticism the Labor Party have - and we have had two questions now - about the budget is about the politics of it.                     Oh, yes! It is all about the politics. It is not about the economics of it. It is all about the politics. That is why the Labor Party was not fit to govern. That is why the Labor Party is not fit to govern.

  We need to move now - and I thank the member for Boothby for his question. He would remember the 1996 budget. He was there with us, with a number of other members. The fact was that it was similar in one sense: a coalition government is elected; Labor do not tell the full story about what the budget is. Of course, in those days, it was a $96 billion debt and a $10 billion black hole - the Beazley black hole. But this time around Labor have exceeded their record. On this occasion, it is $667 billion of debt and $123 billion of deficits. And the Labor Party hold their hands in the air and say: 'No train crash here. There's no problem here.' The debt is going up. The deficits are continuing endlessly - 'There's no problem here.' Unemployment is rising. 'There's no problem here, everything is okay, we did a fabulous job,' they convince themselves.                 The problem is that someone has to pick up the bill. And do you know who has to pick up the bill? The taxpayers of Australia have to pick up the bill. They are the ones who are going to have to pay for the reckless indifference of the Labor Party towards taxpayers' money - $667 billion of debt. In the budget this year, through our decisions, we reduced that by almost $300 billion. In 10 years that represents interest savings alone of $16 billion a year. That is the equivalent of building 15 new teaching hospitals every year. And the Labor Party want to have their way. The Labor Party want that $16 billion a year not to go into some other purpose that is going to build a stronger nation. They want us to provide that money as interest to people that we have borrowed the money from. That is their idea of a priority. Our priority is to have a nation that lives within its means. Our priority is to pay our bills as we go along. Our priority is to leave the Australian people with a better quality of life -                      Our priority is not to pass the buck to the next generation, asking them to pay for our lifestyle.

  I am happy to take that question from the Leader of the Opposition. Obviously there were some things in the budget last night that the states liked, such as the record Commonwealth spend on infrastructure. There were other things that they probably did not like, because we are not going to be bound by unsustainable spending commitments that were made by members opposite. We will not be bound by Labor's unsustainable spending commitments. We are not going to be bound by the budget booby traps that members opposite put in. They are state government run public hospitals. They are state government run public schools. The state governments will need to take more responsibility for these in the future, as is right and proper.                      What the people of Australia expect is grown-up adult governments in the states, just as they have now got a grown-up adult government in Canberra. That is as it should be.

  I would not go there. I say to the honourable member that there have been changes to the parliamentary super scheme. He might not be familiar with that, but there have been changes to the parliamentary super scheme. I know he is an immensely wealthy man and he might not understand and might not have looked at the documentation in relation to his superannuation scheme. I urge him to do that. The fact is there were changes made some years ago to the parliamentary super scheme and, in addition, we have made changes now to the gold card program. Everyone has to make a contribution. I understand the Labor Party has decided not to support the temporary deficit reduction levy, so the Labor Party and the honourable member obviously would prefer to see others do the heavy lifting and them make no contribution at all.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. It is so important that we ask Australians to contribute now. We do so because - and I understand this is an old Irish saying - you fix the roof while the sun is shining. In this case we have $667 billion of debt. If we do not start the process now of trying to ensure that we never get to that level, then the pain associated with dealing with it in a few years time is going to be far greater. We have been very up-front with the Australian people in asking them to pay a temporary budget repair levy on incomes above $180,000. We believe it is only fair that everyone contribute. It is also the case that we are asking Australians to pay for indexation in their fuel excise and, if they contribute that excise, in law we are going to hypothecate it to road funding which is going to substantially increase into the future. In fact, in this budget we are spending well in excess of an additional $11 billion on roads, and the total excise increase would be the equivalent of just over $2 billion.                     There is something that we understand that I am afraid our political opponents do not - that is, if you want to spend money today, you should raise the money today. If you want to spend the money today, you should do everything you can to raise the money today. One of the challenges is that our political opponents did not do that. They spent in excess of $14 billion out of assumed revenue from the mining tax that raised hardly any money. So what happens? The government goes and borrows from the next generation in order to pay for handouts like the schoolkids bonus. Labor is still defending those sort of things even though we have to borrow money to pay for them. They do not understand. If you want to be responsible, and if you want to be responsible across the generations, it is the duty of everyone here to ensure that when we spend money we raise money and we do not go down the path of continuing to borrow money that at the end of the day our children are going to have to repay.

  The whole nation is paying the price of the Labor Party's incompetence.                     Let me tackle the issues that the Leader of the Opposition raises absolutely head-on. Yes, there is a temporary deficit levy. No-one likes it. I certainly do not like it. But it will impact on just three per cent of taxpayers. We are indexing fuel excise. Again, it is not something that people would necessarily like, but the fact is the money is hypothecated to extra road spending, and that will cost the average family 40 cents a week in the first year.                 The decisions that this government has made since September last year reduce the overall tax burden by $5.7 billion. There is all this huffing and puffing from members opposite about broken promises and about lower taxes. Well, let us keep the promise to get rid of the carbon tax because that would save every single Australian family $550 a year. This is a government which does not just talk about lowering taxes; this is a government which is lowering taxes - and it delivered that last night.

  I thank the honourable member for the question. He knows and I know that it is hugely important that we provide a well-resourced, sustainable safety net for those most vulnerable in the community. It is hugely important. Of course, welfare represents 35 per cent of the total Commonwealth budget, so we spend more on welfare than we do on health care for our citizens. We spend more on welfare than we spend on the education of our children. We spend more on welfare than we spend on the defence of the nation. Of course, whilst it is important to have a well-resourced, sustainable safety net, what matters most is that we can afford it. That is what matters most.                 The fact is we do have changing demographics, and I, on this very rare occasion, will quote the former - no, the current - member for Lilley. I am sorry I made that mistake. He said in a press release with the honourable member here: 'Increasing the pension age is a responsible reform to meet the challenge of an ageing population and the economic impact it will have for all Australians. Australia must move towards a higher pension age over the next decade.'                 It is quite interesting because the trajectory of our increase in the pension age eligibility to 70 follows the Labor Party's. But, obviously, given that it is going to 70 in the year 2035, I would say to you it is responsible to give people good notice that these are the issues that need to be addressed. It is easy just to put it aside. It is easy to be a critic. All of the criticism from Labor thus far has been political. None of it is about the policy.                     They are all politics, no economics. They are all politics, no policy. Come on and debate these things. Let's debate the issue in relation to the ageing demographic. Let's debate the issues about how we are going to continue to sustain our health system.                     Let's debate the issues that actually go to the heart of our economic prosperity. I would say to the honourable members: what we have laid down is a plan to ensure that what we receive in the future is sustainable -                      because, on the current trajectories, if we just adopt a business-as-usual line, the pain associated with rectification in the future is going to be far greater. It is going to be enormous. We do not want to get to that point. The coalition will not let it get to that point.

  The Leader of the Opposition, if I may say so, should get his facts right. Pensions are not being cut, but after the next election, if this government is re-elected, pensions will grow at a somewhat slower rate because they will be indexed to CPI rather than male total average weekly earnings.                     The most compassionate thing that we can do for the pensioners of Australia is to ensure that pensions are sustainable and that our social services budget is sustainable.                   The member for Griffith then left the chamber.                     I reiterate the point that the most compassionate thing we can do for the pensioners of Australia is to ensure that pensions are sustainable over the long term. That is exactly what we have done. There has not been and will not be any change to pensions in this term of parliament. We have been very up-front with the pensioners of Australia about what we think should happen to pensions in 2017, and if people do not like that they will have the opportunity to vote accordingly at the next election.

  I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question, and I recognise that she has been a fierce fighter for Western Sydney because she wants to see construction and new jobs, and she is determined to have prosperity, in Western Sydney. As the member for Lindsay and all members know, we have now made a massive commitment to infrastructure in Australia that will lead to an investment of $125 billion of new infrastructure over the next few years. The total Commonwealth infrastructure investment in New South Wales is $14.9 billion - a significant sum of money. Why are we doing this? We inherited an economy with falling terms of trade. The mining and resources boom that we have all benefited from over the last few years had a big production phase. It sucked a lot of construction workers out of the rest of the economy and gave them an opportunity to have a well-paid job. That was terrific.                  The mining industry has done and still does a great job. It represents 10 per cent of our economy and two per cent of our jobs. But, the mining industry has moved from a construction phase to a production and export phase. We should celebrate that. However, those workers who were involved in the construction phase are now moving into the other 90 per cent of the economy and looking for work. What we are doing is rolling out long-term infrastructure to give them that work. We are rolling out long-term infrastructure to lift the productive capacity of the other 90 per cent of the Australian economy. If we do not move now to build this infrastructure then there will be a fall in growth in two to three years in the Australian economy with the net result that unemployment will go higher. That is unacceptable to the coalition. There is a price that we have to pay. If Australians pay an extra 40c a week to fill their car as a result of an increase in excise, that gives us a revenue stream to move now on the infrastructure that is going to deliver us sustainable jobs into the future. That is how it works. You cannot promise things on the never-never - you need to move now. Our infrastructure program is not just about today's jobs. Our infrastructure program is about tomorrow's jobs and beyond.

  I thank the member for Ryan for her question. I am very pleased to be able to tell the member for Ryan and the House in general that the government is keeping all its election commitments in education. All of our election commitments will be met in the Education portfolio. Spending on higher education and research will increase by $900 million over the next four years and spending on school education will increase by $3.5 billion over the next four years. So, ironically, because of the cuts delivered by the previous government, by the Leader of the Opposition, we will be spending more on school education in 2017 than Labor would have if they had been re-elected. So let us not hear any of the cant and hypocrisy from the Labor side about education spending.                  In this answer I want to specifically focus, if I may, on higher education, because higher education is one of the really positive features of the budget that the Treasurer delivered last night. The government is embarking on one of the greatest reforms of higher education in 30 years, which will spread opportunity to more than 80,000 Australians across Australia, who will be able to access degrees over the next four years which they would not otherwise have been able to, and to countless apprentices, who will be able to keep doing their apprenticeship and complete it because of the support that we give apprentices in this budget, announced last night.                  So, we are building the skills infrastructure of the future - not just the physical infrastructure but, very importantly, the skills infrastructure of the future. We are doing it in three ways. We will be expanding the demand-driven system to diploma and associate degree courses across Australia, which means that students who do those courses - who are typically low-socioeconomic status, first-generation university goers or low ATAR achievers - will be able to use the courses as pathways into university. It is a major reform and it costs us money. We are overseeing the largest Commonwealth scholarship scheme in Australia's history so that the smartest kid from the lowest socioeconomic status background can go to the best universities in Australia. We are expanding the trade support loan program - extending it and creating it - so that apprentices can access $20,000 of borrowing from the taxpayer over four years to use for their costs of achieving their apprenticeship. We are spreading the benefits of education and skills right across the economy to apprentices, to lower income families, to first-generation university goers. We are investing in the skills infrastructure of the future and we are damn proud of it.

  This budget enshrines two great Australian values: the fair go that we preserve and the 'have a go' value that we want to encourage. They are the values that are embodied in this budget.                      I know that some benefits for families are changing and I accept that. I make the point that it is important to maximise participation in the workforce and it is important to bear down on what is sometimes described as middle-class welfare. It is important to do that, but it is important to do that in ways that are fair.                  If the people of Australia want to look at the budget documentation, they will see, for instance, that if you are a single-income family, with one child under six, with $30,000 of income you are still receiving more than $18,000 from the taxpayer. If you are a single-income family, with one child, on $90,000 you are still receiving $6,000 from the taxpayer.                  I say again, if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is very anxious to ensure that this government keeps its commitments and if she is as anxious as she says she is to ease the squeeze on families then let us repeal the carbon tax straightaway. Let us repeal the carbon tax straightaway and give all the families of Australia a $550 windfall. Let us give them $550 a year straightaway.

  I thank the member for Bennelong not just for his question but for his commitment to medical research. He is a great supporter of medical research in this country. This morning I spoke to Professor Charlie Teo, who is one of our nation's greatest neurosurgeons.                      He was over the moon, absolutely over the moon, as many other researchers are about the government's commitment to medical research. Not only are we providing record amounts now to medical research, but we will increase that investment as we go forward. As a nation, we face a great threat as our population ages in relation to dementia and diseases of the brain otherwise. In fact, it is projected that by 2050, 7,500 Australians each week will present with dementia. We have to make the investment today to make sure that we can provide the opportunities for research and discovery that will assist our doctors and our scientists to make those discoveries and to implement the medications and the advice that flow from them. I am very proud of the fact that we are in this portfolio at this time able to say that we will increase health expenditure over the forward estimates in 2014-15 by 3.7 per cent. In 2015-16 it increases again to $68.2 billion. It increases in 2016-17, it increases in 2017-18, and health funding will continue to grow in this budget.                 There are other people who have been complimentary of the government's $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. Let me go to Professor Doug Hilton, who is the Institute Director at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. He says:                 This investment from the government is game changing.                 He also says, 'It is a fabulous time to be a medical researcher in this country.' The Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes said:                 Creation of this $20 billion fund into perpetuity is amongst the most significant initiatives in the history of medical research in Australia.                 We will set this health system up for the future, not just for today. We will protect it against the Labor Party into the future. This fund will have its capital protected, because it will be guarded by the Future Fund guardians. We will not allow Labor to attack the $20 billion. We will make sure that the $1 billion a year that will flow from this $20 billion capital fund will supplement the money that we are putting into medical research now - which will grow to about $2 billion a year - and we will stop the Labor Party from spending that $20 billion at any time in the future. This fund is about setting the future up for this country and that is what this government is about.

  We made a commitment that every dollar of saving is reinvested in the world's largest medical research fund, which will be good for cures, treatment, and the health of all Australians in the years and decades ahead.                 The shadow minister says that somehow I am unfit for office because I support a co-payment. There is a better way of operating a health system, and the change could hardly hurt at all. As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doctor - and the idea is hardly radical. Who said that? The shadow assistant treasurer. If I am not fit for office, neither is he, presumably, and I imagine that the Leader of the Opposition will be requiring his resignation.

  I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for her question. She, like me, would have been delighted, last night, as the treasurer outlined the biggest infrastructure program in our nation's history. It was a real commitment to building the roads of the 21st century, a commitment that went way beyond anything Labor left behind in their forward estimates and went way beyond the things that the Labor Party had promised during the election campaign. We all know that what they promised in the election campaign always had conditions attached to it that the states would not find acceptable or was going to be funded out of the proceeds of the mining tax, which produced no significant money. The reality is that this was a real change, a government committed to really building the infrastructure projects that matter so much for our country.                 The member for Capricornia will be particularly pleased about the commitments to the Bruce Highway, which is so critical to her electorate and so important for getting people in and out of Rockhampton and the other parts of her electorate. The budget includes substantial new investment on the Bruce Highway. There will be funding for 16 continuing projects and for 45 new projects on the Bruce Highway. This will make a difference in getting rid of some of the flood-prone areas, like the Yeppen flood plain, south of the member's electorate, and in making sure that traffic is able to move more smoothly along that road.                 But there are major projects in every state, capital, country community, and right across the nation. There are the East West Link in Melbourne, the Pacific Highway from Sydney to Brisbane, the Western Sydney road projects - $2.9 billion to connect Western Sydney, WestConnex - and the north-south corridor in Adelaide. We will complete the gateway project in Western Australia and build the Swan Valley Bypass. There is $400 million for the Midland Highway. We will complete the Majura Parkway in the ACT. There will be significant road funding also in the Northern Territory. This is a major growth package that will deliver real results for Australia. It will make our road transport move more smoothly. It will ensure that there are jobs for Australian industry in construction -

  I want to reiterate to the shadow minister that this is a government that has kept faith with the commitments that it made to the Australian people before the election. Every dollar of savings in health is reinvested in health.                     It is reinvested in the world's biggest medical research fund, which will find the treatments and cures we need so that our health system and the health of our people gets better in the years to come. That is our responsibility. Our responsibility is to do the right thing by the people of Australia. Our responsibility is not to make easy decisions but to make the right decisions, and that is what this budget has done. It has made the right but difficult and necessary decisions for the long-term future of the people of this country.

  I thank the member for her question. There are three big dividends that come to the budget as a result of the coalition's stronger border protection policies: an economic dividend, a humanitarian dividend and a reform dividend. There is a $2.5 billion boat-stopping dividend in this budget. And there is a bonus of $280 million in savings from our 'closing the detention centre revolution' - closing the centres that those opposite opened when their border policies failed because they were not up to the job. Also, there is a $300 million contribution to the budget as a result of a better-put-together immigration program, with a greater focus on skills, a greater focus on people who come the right way to Australia, and the removal of incentives for those who come the wrong way. The previous government created 4,000 places for family reunions for people who had come to Australia illegally by boat. We have removed those places, and it has saved the budget $260 million.                 There is a humanitarian dividend, as well, beyond the fact of stopping the deaths at sea, which is this: 20,000 places have been restored to the refugee and humanitarian program this year and over the next four years, because we have freed them up in the special humanitarian program. Those places otherwise would have gone to those who had come to Australia illegally by boat.                 In addition to that, there is a reform dividend in this budget through reversing the $700 million in cuts over the forward estimates to the border agencies that occurred over the previous six years under the previous government. Over the next six years we will restore that with over $700 million invested in our border agencies, including the establishment of the Australian Border Force, which brings together the combined efforts, experience and talent of our customs and immigration officers to provide one single force on our borders to pick up from Operation Sovereign Borders, which has ensured that for the past 20 weeks, or 146 days, there has not been a single successful maritime people-smuggling venture to this country. We said that we would stop the boats with our policies. Those opposite derided it and said it could not be done, but it is happening. That is what is happening.                 In the budget last night we said, through the Treasurer, that we will repair the budget. With the budget handed down by the Treasurer that is what we are going to do. This is a government that says what it is going to do and then gets on and does it.

  The difficulty with members opposite is that they want this country to live constantly beyond its means, to keep making payments that it cannot afford, with borrowed money. That is the problem with members opposite. They want this country to continue making payments we cannot afford, with borrowed money.                     We expect people under 30, the young people of Australia, to be either earning or learning.                     We expect them to be in employment or, if for whatever reason they are not in employment, we expect them to be improving their skills and receiving the support the Commonwealth government quite rightly provides to people who are improving their skills, including youth allowance.                     And I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to the shadow minister opposite, who presumably did not look at every element in the budget -                      that we are making it much easier to go to university, to do a diploma, to do an apprenticeship or a traineeship with our Trade Support Loans.                     I say to the Leader of the Opposition, it is not kind to put people on social security when there is an alternative.                     There is always a training or education alternative available to the young people of Australia, and if they are not in employment, we should encourage them to take it.

  I thank the member for Herbert for his question, and his lack of impersonation of my answer. This government understands that the most important thing to give to young people is the opportunity to get a long-term job and a well-paying job, and the member for Herbert understands that. I have had the opportunity with the member for Herbert to visit a skills and training centre in his electorate, and his support for the young people in that electorate is palpable. You only have to talk to the member for Herbert to know that he sees the importance of getting young people into jobs. And the way to do that in particular is to upgrade their skills and to encourage them to not only take up apprenticeships but to actually complete them.                 What we have in Australia at the moment is a situation where half of the apprenticeships that are started are not completed. We announced in our Economic Action Strategy that we intend to build a strong and prosperous economy, and to do that we want the young people - not just in Herbert, but right around Australia - to participate in the growth of that economy. We want to see them get a trade, go out and earn a living and look forward to a long-term prospect, and they will not do that if they do not complete their apprenticeship. So we have introduced a Trade Support Loans scheme that will give apprentices a loan of $20,000. Under this scheme we will roll out about $1.9 billion worth of loans, and when they complete their four years 20 per cent of that loan will be written off - 20 per cent, $4,000, immediately discounted. Not only that, but the value of the discount in terms of repaying it over the term against a commercial loan makes this scheme worth more than double the scheme it replaces in Tools For Your Trade.                 We are moving from a scheme such as Tools For Your Trade - where money was just given with no requirement to complete your apprenticeship - to a scheme where we actively encourage young people to complete their apprenticeships. Not only is it worth more than double -                      I just restate the point that this is worth twice as much in the hand of the apprentices as the scheme it replaces - more than twice as much. In fact, the repayments under this scheme are less than a third of what they would be if they used a commercial loan. This government supports outcomes. By having a scheme that encourages young people in particular to complete their apprenticeships and get the full discount on the loan, we are ensuring that they have a long-term, viable future in the workforce.

  May I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he is all politics, no policy; all complaint, no solutions. And I might offer this thought to members opposite - that confected moral outrage is no basis for governing a country -                      And it is one of the reasons members opposite are utterly unfit for government.                     What this country needs is a government which is prepared to confront the reality that our country faces, the reality of debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see, the debt and deficit disaster which the members opposite, the Labor Party, created. This government did not create the problem but we take responsibility for addressing it. We take responsibility for fixing the problem - the debt and deficit disaster that Labor created. I think that is exactly what the people of Australia elected us to do and I am proud to serve them in my capacity as Prime Minister of this great nation.

  The member for Durack knows that the budget, which the Treasurer delivered last night, provides a record amount of infrastructure spending in this country and Western Australia does not miss out. In fact, there will be $4.7 billion of infrastructure investment in Western Australia over the next few years.  It will be investment in productivity lifting and in enhancing infrastructure, which will mean more jobs and greater prosperity for our country. This investment is $16.5 billion more than the Labor Party promised during their election campaign on infrastructure - $16.5 billion more for funding projects such as the Great Northern Highway, the North West Coastal Highway in the member's electorate of Durack, the Swan Valley bypass and the Gateway WA project. But importantly we will be funding a new project in this budget, the Perth Freight Link project - a $1.6 billion project. For this new project, $925 million is being funded by the Australian government, a 20 per cent contribution is coming from the Western Australian government and the remaining funds are made up from the private sector investment - for the first time in Western Australia.                  This project will be a huge benefit for the member from Durack because all the goods from her part of the world, which are our great export lifeline, will be able to be moved more quickly through Perth, getting trucks off the major highways. This will also mean commuters can drive on the roads without competing with big trucks. This is a huge reform, thanks to the innovation of the infrastructure Prime Minister and his government, and the Western Australian government. This is not only a $50 billion program; it is a program with innovation at its heart.                  The Labor Party did not support and was utterly opposed to the WestConnex - Stage 2 project. It was also utterly opposed to and did not have any idea about the East West Link project in Melbourne and the North-South Corridor in Adelaide - we are delivering both projects. The Labor Party did not have it within its wit to do so. This is the infrastructure Prime Minister driving productivity growth in our country, driven through a Treasurer who has put in place in the budget the money required to ensure that these projects get done - not just announced on whiteboards but actually done and delivered. New projects worth $50 billion is a fantastic development for Australia - that is, more jobs, more growth and a stronger Australia.

  I stand by what I said before the election. I absolutely stand by what this government has done in last night's budget. I am absolutely confident that, when the Australian people come to judge this government and this opposition in 2016, they will vote for a government which has been faithful to its pre-election commitments. Do you know what the Australian people were looking for in the election last year? After six years of dysfunction, the people of Australia were looking for some leadership. They were looking for a government that was prepared to make not the easy decisions but the hard decisions. The people of Australia were looking for leadership. Last night they found it.

  I am very pleased to be able to tell the member for Swan that we are delivering better outcomes for school students across Australia through this budget. We are doing it by funding our election commitments to the letter, whether they are through teacher quality, a robust curriculum, principal and school autonomy or parental engagement. We are funding all of those commitments to the letter.                 Even better, we are keeping the commitment we made before the election that we would fund the new school funding model in exactly the same way as Labor for the next four years and that is what we are doing. We have also put $1.2 billion back into school funding which the Leader of the Opposition took out when he was the ninth Minister for Education in the previous government.                 The Leader of the Opposition would like the people to forget that. They would like the Australian people to have the memory of a goldfish, as the Leader of the Opposition has. But we will not forget and we will keep reminding the Australian public that the Leader of the Opposition removed school funding and we have put it back. Ironically, we are spending more in 2017 on school funding than Labor would have if they had been re-elected.                 On Thursday night, the Leader of the Opposition will have his opportunity to fess up. He will have to stop being the No. 1 whinger in Australia. He will have to start having solutions rather than being all complaint and no responsibility. If No. 1 whinger in Australia were a reality TV show, there would be no point in any other contestant entering it - because if Bill Shorten entered it, he would win it! But on Thursday night the Leader of the Opposition has an opportunity -                      I will. I withdraw. On Thursday night, the Leader of the Opposition has to do three things. He has to explain how he would address the debt and deficit disaster left by the previous government. He has to explain how he would address that. Secondly, he has to explain how he would fund the physical and skills infrastructure that Australia needs in the future without just borrowing more money from overseas, as the previous government did. He has to explain how he would deliver the infrastructure that we are delivering while reducing the tax burden by $5.7 billion over the budget. Thirdly, he has to explain how he would establish a sustainable safety net for Australians into the future, because that is what we did in the budget last night. In this budget, Australians have found that they have a government of adults who will make the tough decisions to make the safety net, which we on this side of the House all regard very highly, sustainable into the future - and not just by borrowing more money overseas. If he does not meet those three tests, explaining how he would deal with the budget, then he will not measure up as Leader of the Opposition on Thursday night.

  I thank the member for Dobell for her question and for the way that she represents the decent, aspirational people of the Central Coast, who do understand that governments, like families and businesses, have to live within their means. This is why this country could not go on as it had under the Labor Party. This is why this government is refusing to put our nation's mortgage on the credit card, as the Labor Party had been doing for far too long.                 Unaffordable payments with borrowed money necessarily have to be reined back. This is a tough budget. This is not a tough budget because this government wanted it to be tough; it is a tough budget because it needs to be tough to deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. The Treasurer has quite rightly described this as a 'contribute and build' budget. Everyone will contribute and will benefit from the stronger economy that this budget will create.                 This budget is not about the political convenience of this government, it is about the long-term strength of the Australian economy. As I said, everyone will contribute. High-income earners will contribute through the deficit levy, members of parliament will contribute through the pay freeze and everyone will contribute through fuel excise indexation.                 This is not just a budget for saving; this is a budget for building, a budget for nation building. There is the biggest infrastructure spend in the history of the Commonwealth. There is a world-leading medical research fund to give us the treatments and cures of the future and there are innovative trade support loans to ensure that the decent working people of this country get a good start in their working life. Back in 1996, an earlier coalition government brought in a budget that was tough but fair and would set up this country for a decade of prosperity, and this government's budget is a budget in that proud tradition.

  I know the member for Reid has been most concerned about the level of debt that has been handed to the Australian people by the Labor Party. He has often used the line that we are now borrowing to pay the interest on that debt, and he is absolutely right, because in their first five years in office Labor delivered $191 billion in deficits and they left a legacy going forward of $123 billion of deficits, but the budget was never getting to surplus. And they left debt of $667 billion. That is quite amazing.                 In his budget reply speech last year the now Prime Minister identified $5 billion a year in savings to help repair the budget. He had the courage to stand up here in the budget in-reply speech, just as the Leader of the Opposition is going to do tonight, and he said, 'There is a budget emergency. Let's put $5 billion a year of savings on the table.' We said that before the election to prove we were so concerned about the legacy of Labor, involving debt and deficits. We were up-front with the Australian people right here. Now, tonight -                      I am so pleased the member for Watson just interjected, because I was looking at his comments last night on TV, where he said, 'We had a spending growth cap of two per cent in place. We had actually observed better than that. We had a cap in spending.' I went back and I heard him say that in fact their spending cap was just over one per cent. I thought: hang on, that is not right. How did he get 1.35 per cent over four years? It was because he left out the fifth year, which had 12 per cent growth. How did that happen? So Labor had this artificial cap at two per cent, which in fact they never met.                     They said, 'Going forward, don't worry Australia, it is a two per cent cap.' But, in fact, going forward they left a 3.7 per cent cap. That is a $220 billion mistake. I say to the Labor Party: we know you are walking away from reality, but tonight the Leader of the Opposition has to be frank with the Australian people not just about his legacy but about what he is going to do.

  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question is simply false. There is a statement in her question that is simply false. We are not cutting pensions.                     We are not cutting pensions. But after the next election we are proposing to change the method of indexation for pensions. That is what we are proposing to do after the next election.                     I will be absolutely candid with members opposite. What we did in this budget was demonstrate our plan to clean up Labor's mess. And, yes, it is a tough plan. A lot of people will not like it. But what people understand is that there is no easy way to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Our budget is our plan to clean up Labor's debt and deficit disaster. What we want from the Leader of the Opposition tonight is his plan to clean up the mess he created. If he cannot offer us that plan he just demonstrates the fact that he is simply unworthy of high office.

  I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. She is absolutely right, and that has weighed heavily on our deliberations. I would say to the member for Indi that what you have just said proves that the status quo is not working. The legacy environment provided by the previous government is not working, and that is why we have rising unemployment. In your electorate, that is why - as you say - you have very high youth unemployment. That is why we have put in place mechanisms that on a larger scale are going to stimulate job creation; and the starting point is to reduce company tax for 800,000 businesses by 1.5 per cent. That is a big step forward. That will help a lot of small- and medium-sized enterprises in your electorate. Secondly, in relation to unemployment, we are giving businesses $10,000 to employ someone over the age of 50 who has been on Newstart or a Disability Support Pension -                      for six months. That is about changing the culture of business. In relation to younger people, we are for the first time extending the concessional loans system that is available to university students to people for diploma courses or sub-bachelor degree courses. That is an important step forward, because it treats everyone the same. We are also giving anyone who undertakes an apprenticeship a $20,000 loan during the course of that apprenticeship to help them stay in that apprenticeship during the course of their work.                 The fundamental point is that we need people under the age of 30 to earn or learn. What has not worked to date are the legacy policies of the previous government that saw youth unemployment rise and saw the overarching unemployment levels of Australia rise. We left them an unemployment rate of just over four per cent; we inherited an unemployment rate rising to 6Â¼ per cent. And all the shrieking from Labor cannot make up for the fact that someone has to fix the mess, and we stand ready to do it.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I am going to endeavour to sing a wonderful tune for a brief moment, and that is about our infrastructure commitment in the last budget, which is going to contribute to $125 billion of new productive infrastructure in Australia. We are committing $3 billion to build the East West Link right across Melbourne - a hugely important project. It will reduce travel times by up to 20 minutes for commuters travelling from places such as Geelong and Ballarat to the city - the honourable member would welcome that - and remove 20,000 trucks each day from roads around residential streets. The eastern section is expected to allow around 100,000 vehicles each day to bypass 23 sets of traffic lights. And the western section - this is important, and the Leader of the Opposition might want to listen to this - will provide additional capacity for 100,000 vehicles per day and will provide cross-city alternatives to the already congested eastern Monash and West Gate freeways. The good news is that this actually starts before the end of this year. The work actually starts - the shovels will start moving - before the end of this year. This is excellent news for Melbourne. It illustrates our commitment to get on with the job. Our political opponents talked a lot about infrastructure but they never actually delivered. We are getting on with it with a $3 billion commitment. I would think that the Leader of the Opposition would be enthusiastically embracing the East West Link project because once upon a time he said:                 There are chronic problems in the western suburbs in terms of egress, and I'm keen to see it get better connected _ there is a shortage of east-west links.                 That was Leader of the Opposition. So I assume he supports our $3 billion commitment to the East West Link project. I assume he supports 6,000 jobs. I assume he supports getting on with the job before Christmas, but I will tell you what he does not support. He does not support people helping to pay for it. We are understandably bewildered at Labor's position on taxes because last week they were opposing the deficit levy; apparently tonight they are supporting it. Today they are opposing the increase in excise on fuel but still they want to have the East West Link. That is Labor on the never-never. Nothing changes.

  If the shadow minister opposite has a look at tables in the budget documents, she will see that we are continuing to provide generous assistance to families with children. Obviously there are some changes to family tax benefit part B - I accept that. I also accept that former Prime Minister Howard was, as he said today, 'the father of family tax benefit part B'. There are some things that were absolutely right when we had surpluses of $20 billion a year and there are quite different things which are absolutely right when we have deficits of $50 billion a year, and that is what we are dealing with. We are dealing with the debt and deficit disaster that the members opposite created. We are dealing with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. There were some things that were affordable when we had a $20 billion surplus. Those things are now not affordable with the $50 billion deficits - the deficits that this Labor Party has given us.                  I want to say that John Howard, to his great credit, made the decisions that were right for his time and this government will make the decisions that are right for our time.

  The honourable member for Parkes understands full well how important it is to have strong regional economies if we want to have a strong nation. When our country is strong, our regions are strong. Unfortunately, the regions have suffered from the last six years of Labor governments - Labor governments which cared little about regional Australia. Promises were made, many funded by a mining tax were therefore essentially unfunded because the mining tax did not raise any money. But this budget sets a new path for Australia, a path to deliver a sustainable future for our nation. A significant part of delivering that sustainable future is the investment in infrastructure that the Treasurer has just referred to - a $50 billion Commonwealth contribution towards infrastructure expenditure of at least a $125 billion. This is a commitment that makes a difference everywhere in this country - significantly in our cities where a large number of major projects have been announced, and also in the regional communities.                  There is a $2.5 billion commitment in this budget to the Roads to Recovery program, extending the program into the future. In 2015-16, there will be a double payment to local governments across Australia to help them with their road and streets works. In addition to that, there is a $565 million investment to fix dangerous spots on our roads - the accident spots, the black spots - many of which are in regional Australia and in country towns. There is a further $300 million for our new Bridges Renewal Program to fix some of those bridges which are falling apart and can no longer carry heavy loads, preventing the school bus from taking children to school. We will be fixing those projects in consultation with our communities.                  We will also be delivering on specific projects in regional communities through our Community Grants program. This includes even picking up some of the projects announced by the previous government which they had not funded, they had not contracted. We are doing the right things for those communities to fix and deliver the projects that Labor had not properly funded. In addition to that, there will be our own $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund. There is $100 million for mobile phones. We are grateful to the Minister for Communications for getting on with that task of filling in the gaps. We will make sure that regional Australia is back on the agenda and we will be listening tonight to see whether Labor has learned anything about regional Australia in the opposition's budget reply.

  That was not really a question about the policy. That was just a political assertion. I would say to the member for McMahon, if he wants to debate the issue, let us debate the issue. Let us debate the fact that Labor left us with $667 billion of debt -                      and $123 billion of deficits. Something needs to be done about it. Let us debate the fact that they left us with rising unemployment and falling terms of trade, and we need to deal with those things. Let us also have a debate about the fact that Labor left locked-in increases in expenditure over the medium term of 3.7 per cent per year above inflation with an economy that is growing at less than three per cent. Let us have a debate about these things, because they go directly to the quality of life that we are creating for the Australian people. They are the issues that do matter.                 Labor has not yet said whether it supports the Medical Research Future Fund, because the only way the Medical Research Future Fund can be created is if there is a co-contribution when people go to visit the doctor. That is because every dollar of savings over the next six years in the health portfolio is going into the Medical Research Future Fund. It is the biggest medical research fund of its kind in the world.                 Why we doing this? We are doing this because only through -                      cure and discovery are we going to ensure that the health system Australians want and deserve over the next 50 years is going to be delivered. That is, finding a cure for cancer, finding a cure for dementia and finding a cure for Alzheimer's, and the Labor Party does not support that.                     No, they do not. The member for Chifley says that they do not support the medical research that is going to find a cure for cancer, dementia or Alzheimer's. Why? That is because the Labor Party has never, ever paid it forward. They have never invested for the future. They have never understood that if you really want to build something that is going to improve the quality of life of everyday Australians -                    The member for Rankin then left the chamber.                     you have the start investing now. It is all about the politics. The entire contribution of the political opposition in response to the budget has been about politics - not about economics and not about building a stronger future. All they have to say is the political line. That has been their line for six years. Australians have had enough of it.

  I thank the member for Barker for his question and I commend him for the great representation of people in south-east South Australia that he brings to this parliament and of their interests as his constituents. This government believes that young people should be learning or earning - learning or earning. That is why we are going to tighten access to unemployment benefits, the Newstart benefit, for young people in Australia under the age of 30. We will be doing that by applying a waiting period of up to six months, depending on a person's work history, to become eligible for the Newstart or the unemployment benefit. The important point about this is that if a young person returns to school or takes up training or study they are exempt from these provisions - totally exempt from these provisions - and they will get the support that the Minister for Education was pointing out in his previous answer in this place.                 But we also recognise that there are a range of circumstances in which people may be vulnerable and therefore they should be exempt from this provision as well. So single parents in receipt of the family tax benefit will be exempt. Principal carers will be exempt. People who are not able to work 30 hours a week - they too will be exempt. Part-time apprentices will be exempt. Participants in the Disability Employment Services scheme - they too will be exempt. And of course stream 3 and 4 job seekers will be exempt.                     I am asked the question by the member opposite, 'Who's in it?' That is a good question, because the answer is: this scheme is targeted to work-ready young people; and, if they are not working, then we want them to be in training so that they can get a job in the future. That is what this scheme is clearly about.                     The comments coming from the other side of the chamber mark the contrast between the Labor opposition and this government, because we have a Labor opposition that wants young Australians to be welfare ready, and this is a government that wants them to be work ready.

  The budget that was brought down earlier this week is a very important budget for the future of our country. It is designed to create a culture of enterprise. It is designed to ensure that we are not focusing on what people cannot do but on what people can do. Now, the shadow minister obviously was not listening to the very good answer on this very topic that has just been provided by the Minister for Social Services, but I want to say that the -                      We believe that work-ready youngsters, work-capable youngsters, ought to be either learning or earning; and, as a result of this budget, those who are not working for a wage will have far more opportunity to learn a skill, to go to university, to go to TAFE, because this government is giving them far more opportunity to do so. I believe that this budget embodies the great aspirations of the Australian people, and at the very heart of our national character are two things: first of all, the desire to extend to the more vulnerable members of our community a fair go. This budget absolutely protects the fair-go principle which is so important in this country of ours that we love. Australians also expect the people who can to have a go. That is what this is all about. Those who are not capable of working will continue to be protected, but those who are capable of working will be expected to have a go. They will be expected to be either earning or learning - and that is the way it ought to be.

  I thank the member for Brisbane, who is the local member for some of the finest medical research institutes in the country. She is a passionate supporter at a personal level of many medical research causes, as many Australians are. We contribute to medical research because we have a mature model with the world's best researchers. We have amazing institutes. We have universities and other clinical settings that deserve the support of their government.                 I believe that one of the proudest achievements of this budget is the creation of the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. There are a couple of important aspects to it. One is that we will protect the capital into perpetuity. We will stop any future Labor government from raiding that fund, which is incredibly important because we know that the Labor Party have never seen a dollar that they did not want to spend. We also want to make sure that as the capital is protected we can spend down the earnings, which will mean by 2015-16 we will increase the money that we are already spending in medical research by about $20 million and by 2022 that figure will grow to over $1 billion. With that money we will help the best researchers in the world find the cures and discoveries that will be needed with the ageing of our population.                 We know in our country already that treatment for diseases of the brain, rare cancers and coronary disease needs extra support. If we are to have a sustainable health system going forward we have to put extra money into research so that not only can we extend our life expectancy but we can improve our way of life in this country. This government is absolutely determined to make sure that we can grow that investment.                 I want to turn to a couple of comments that have been made by people who know a lot about medical research. Professor Frank Gannon, who is the QIMR Berghofer director, said:                 This is an extraordinary investment in our health, and an emphatic declaration about the importance of medical research to Australia's future health and prosperity.                 He went on to say:                 It is a landmark initiative in the history of medical research in Australia.                 We are going to fund this research capital fund in part by introducing a $7 co-payment which will allow $5 to go into the medical research fund and $2 to go towards a GP. Importantly, we will maintain bulk-billing in this country, but we will make the health system sustainable as we go forward. This Leader of the Opposition may be a former leader of the ACTU, just like Bob Hawke, but this bloke is no Bob Hawke.

  I am happy to respond to the confected indignation, based on selective memory, of the Leader of the Opposition. As I said in this chamber yesterday, yes, for three years there will be an increase in the top marginal rate of tax that will impact on three per cent of taxpayers. Yes, there is fuel excise indexation. In the first year that means about 40c a week for the average family. But, overall, the decisions made by this government reduce the tax burden by $5.7 billion.                 If the Leader of the Opposition is as concerned as he says he is about commitments and getting tax down, there is a simple thing he can announce tonight - that he is going to help this parliament repeal the carbon tax. That is the challenge that I extend to this Leader of the Opposition: repeal the carbon tax. If you are fair dinkum about giving families a break, repeal the carbon tax tonight and give families of Australia a $550-a-year tax break.                 This government have been honest and upfront with the Australian people with a budget that accepts that there are no soft options anymore. We have accepted that there are no soft options anymore, but we are going to hear from the Leader of the Opposition more soft options, more cop-outs and more borrow-and-spend policies. We have put before the people of Australia a comprehensive plan to clean up Labor's debt and deficit disaster. We have put forward our plan to clean up Labor's mess. What we now need from the Leader of the Opposition is his plan to clean up the mess that he created.

  I thank the member for Hughes for his question and I also congratulate him for his involvement in last week's launch at ANSTO of a new nuclear medicine facility, which shows that Australia excels in a whole range of areas; in fact, it is a world leader in a whole range of areas. I know that the member for Hughes has a strong interest in what goes on at Lucas Heights, but he has an even stronger interest in what goes on in his electorate for small business, where he has some 10,000 small businesses. He fully understands the importance of a skilled workforce to those small businesses. That is why the government are introducing our trade support loans scheme; that is why we want to give apprentices more support during their time - more support to become the skilled Australians who will support the productivity growth that we need to see in Australia in the coming years.                 As of 1 July, an apprentice will be able to apply for a loan, which will total $20,000 and which is interest free. Because we have seen, particularly in the Labor times, when Labor was in government, that the number of apprentices falling out of apprenticeship schemes grew by 9,000 between 2008 and 2012 and because we are concerned that apprentices are falling out of their apprenticeships and not completing their schemes, we want to make sure they are incentivised to finish. So, when they finish their four years or however long their apprenticeship takes, they get a 20 per cent deduction off their loan. That is worth $4,000. But that is only part of it. The real story to this is that, compared to a commercial loan, this is worth more than double, almost triple, that amount to an apprentice, and so an apprentice has a real incentive to finish. That is really what it is all about.                 We want to support apprentices while they go through the time of training, which is not dissimilar to a university student. Times are tough when you are trying to make ends meet on an apprenticeship wage. We know that and we want to support them. We want to make sure they have the ability and the desire to finish their apprenticeship. This scheme is there to help them along the way. This scheme is to make sure that there are more skilled apprentices in our workforce, in the seat of Hughes, making sure that the small businesses in that seat have access to the skilled workers who will make their small businesses viable in the long term.

  The premise of the question is simply untrue. Every dollar of savings in health is being reinvested in the medical research fund that will give us the treatments and the cures that our country and our world needs in the years and the decades to come. It is true that pie-in-the-sky promises that were made by the former government do not bind this government. We made that absolutely crystal clear before the last election. We all know that the former government tried to booby trap our fiscal future by making completely unsustainable promises for the out years. The first of those out years is now in the forward estimates period, and I have to say that, in that final year, spending will increase. Spending will continue to increase but it will do so at a sustainable rate, not the absolutely unsustainable rate contained in the pie-in-the-sky promises, the undeliverable pie-in-the-sky promises, that the Labor Party gave before the election.                 Leave not granted.

  I do thank the member for Wannon for his question. And that is quite a career enhancing move, I must say. I appreciate his words of support. This government will deliver an aid program that the nation can responsibly afford in the context of Labor's legacy of record debt and deficit. We have stabilised the aid budget at $5 billion a year. It is projected to increase according to the consumer price index from 2016. This means that Australia remains one of the top 10 aid donors in the OECD world. In fact, we are second only to Japan in our region. Shortly, I will be announcing a new approach to the way we deliver aid. This new framework will comprise performance benchmarks and mutual obligation partnerships so that the Australian taxpayer can be confident that under this government aid will be delivered effectively and efficiently, and results driven with real outcomes.                 Gone will be the days when Labor would make a big announcement about an increase in the aid budget and then, when no-one was watching, they would rip money out to plug holes in their blow-outs elsewhere. In the last 15 months of Labor, $5.7 billion was ripped out of the aid budget. They were misleading people into believing that they were going to meet a target of 0.5 per cent of gross national income. That was a deliberate deceit. They were never going to do it. Gone are the days when the Labor government -                      would take $375 million in 2012 and $375 million in 2013 and rip it out of the aid budget to plug the hole in the border protection budget -                      because they could not afford the onshore processing costs.                     They made themselves the third largest donor of foreign aid under the Australian aid budget - the Labor government themselves.                 What concerns me is that the shadow minister for foreign affairs is still in absolute denial. She is putting out a press release assuming that Labor is going to put $16 billion of additional funding into the aid budget. I would like the Leader of the Opposition to tell us tonight: where is that $16 billion coming from for the aid budget? What programs are you cutting, or is it just more borrowings?                 I am not prone to quoting Labor's last foreign minister - you are not likely to hear me say it often - but I think the shadow foreign minister should well heed the words of Bob Carr when he said, 'The truth is you can't run aid on borrowings.' Only this government will deliver an affordable, sustainable, responsible aid program.

  We said pre-election that we would not be bound by Labor's pie-in-the-sky promises for the out years. We absolutely said that. We made it absolutely crystal clear that borrowing to make unsustainable, unaffordable promises simply was not on. We have made it crystal clear in the budget that in 2017-18 there will be a lower rate of increase in health and hospital spending. We have made that absolutely crystal clear -                      Not a cut; a lower rate of increase. We were absolutely upfront about this pre-election, and we have been absolutely upfront about this in the budget.                 I appreciate that some of the state premiers are unhappy about this. I appreciate that. I should also point out that they are very happy about the infrastructure spending in the budget, and, yes, as far as the states are concerned there are swings and roundabouts. There are some things that they do not like; there are some things that they do like. But what we have done is given them at least three years to prepare, and I am looking forward, through the federation white paper process, to a constructive and collegial dialogue to improve our federation and to try to ensure that the states and territories are sovereign in their own spheres.

  I thank the member for Forde, who was re-elected to this place not only because he is an outstanding local member but also because he is part of a team that is now delivering a more safe and secure Australia and a strong and prosperous economy. He will be pleased to know, as will his constituents, that it has been 147 days since the last successful people-smuggling venture. Over 147 days under the previous government, there were 136 successful ventures - almost one a day over that period. The government have demonstrated our backbone on our borders and this week we demonstrated our backbone in the budget. We ensured a safe and secure Australia and a stronger, prosperous economy for all Australians.                 Border protection does not start and stop with stopping the boats, as we know. There are many threats and challenges and opportunities that are on our borders. We have rising demand: we have an 85 per cent forecast increase in air cargo shipments to Australia over the next few years; we have a 25 per cent increase in international traveller movements to Australia over that period. There is a global supply chain that is becoming more complex, which we must be part of. We are open to the threat of the increasingly interconnected way that global organised criminal gangs are operating and seeking to get through our borders. We also have the fantastic work by the minister for trade, who is opening up trade opportunities for Australia, and we need to be able to realise that by being facilitative and efficient and competitive at our border.                 Operation Sovereign Borders has shown the way in how to harness the collective energies of our border agencies to get the job done. We will be establishing the Australian Border Force, which will bring together the collective energies of our Customs and immigration officials to ensure that we can address all the many threats and deliver on all the opportunities that are there for us to gain at our borders. We will be investing over $700 million over the next six years into the establishment of the Australian Border Force, and into the Customs and Border Protection Service over the next 12 months as well. That reverses the $700-plus million cuts to our border agencies that occurred over the previous six years under the previous government.                  Stronger borders will ensure that we will realise the economic opportunities that a growing trade and traveller opportunity for Australia will present to us. But it will also ensure that we are able to counter the very real and serious threats that exist at our borders. We have demonstrated how we deliver on our borders and we are demonstrating that -

  I do not especially like some of the things that we have had to do to clean up Labor's debt and deficit disaster. I do not especially like that, and in a different world we would have been able to have a different budget. But in the real world - the world that we have inherited from the Labor Party - we have to clean up the debt and deficit disaster. We have to clean up the debt and deficit disaster. We have to accept that fact that the soft options that were peddled for six years by the Labor Party are simply no longer available to the Australian people.                  We were elected not to make the easy decisions but to make the hard ones. We were elected not to squib things but to embrace the difficult decisions that were needed to secure this country's future. That is what we were elected to do. We were elected to put the budget back under control. And on no fewer than 31 separate occasions during the election campaign that is exactly what I promised.                  I promised that we would stop the boats, that we would scrap the carbon tax, that we would build the roads of the 21st century and that we would get the budget back under control. I am very proud to say that that is exactly what happened on Tuesday night. I am very pleased to say that this is a government with the intestinal fortitude to do the things that members opposite always lacked the guts to do. We did not create the debt and deficit disaster. We did not create it, but we take responsibility for fixing it. Fix it, we will. And we are fixing it in ways that are fair. We are fixing it in ways that are fair and I am very pleased to have this opportunity to wrap up question time on budget week by saying that we have risen to the challenge of these times. We have risen to the challenge of these times by delivering the budget that Australia needs to deal with the debt and deficit disaster that the Labor Party gave us. We have risen to that challenge.                 On that note I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  It is National Sorry Day and it is a perfectly appropriate question for the Leader of the Opposition to kick off question time with today. I am very pleased to be able to reassure the Leader of the Opposition that while we are making some savings in this area, as we are making savings across the board, we believe that by collapsing some 100 separate programs into five broad programs we can achieve efficiencies in service delivery that will mean, with somewhat less money, that we will achieve better outcomes. This is our objective: to achieve better outcomes for the Indigenous people of our country. What we are absolutely committed to doing is to ensuring that children go to school, that adults go to work and that people are safe in their own homes. These changes were thoroughly discussed with the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council. As anyone who had read Warren Mundine's speech given last weekend would know, the council is satisfied that the government are heading in the right direction.

  Australia does have a fundamentally strong economy, but under the former Labor government the budget was fundamentally weak. So we had a fundamentally strong economy but a fundamentally weak budget. What this government is doing is fixing the budget to strengthen our economy - and didn't it need fixing. The former government, the Labor Party, inherited a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank, and they gave the people of Australia the six biggest deficits in our history. They gave us debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see - $123 billion in cumulative projected deficits and $667 billion in projected gross debt. Thanks to the policies pursued by members opposite, this country is borrowing a billion dollars every single month just to pay interest on the borrowings. Under the policies of members opposite, within a decade that mean $3 billion would have to be borrowed every single month - enough to fund the Western Sydney infrastructure package, which this government are getting on with.                  You cannot keep putting the mortgage on the credit card, which is what members opposite have done. This government did not create the problem, but we are shouldering responsibility for fixing it. Under us, instead of a $30 billion deficit in 2017-18, the deficit will come in at under $3 billion and debt will be $300 billion less under the policies that we announced in the budget. This is what the government was elected to do. We were elected to take the tough decisions necessary to get this country back on track and that is exactly what we are doing. Every day before the election, we made it crystal clear what we were doing: we would stop the boats, we would scrap the carbon tax and we would build the road to the 21st century and we would get the budget back under control, and that is precisely what this government are doing.

  We were absolutely crystal clear on budget night that we were changing the conditions for the receipt of family tax benefit part B, that we were reducing the primary income earner's income from $150,000 to $100,000 because we do want to bear down on so-called middle-class welfare -                      We support choice. We absolutely support choice. But there is a limit to how much taxpayer support we can give once the youngest child is at school. There is a limit to that. We were absolutely up-front in the budget about this. We must live within our means. Living within our means means that handouts with borrowed money cannot continue in the way members opposite want.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. I recognise that he, like most other Australians, knows that we have to do something about the legacy of $667 billion of debt that would have been in place had we not taken the decisions that we took on budget night. It is about getting the budget back on track. That was one of our key election promises: to fix the budget, to fix the mess that Labor left. At the moment we are paying a billion dollars a month - one billion dollars every month in interest on the debt that Labor has left. This would be $2.8 billion a month in 10 years time if nothing is done. That is $2.8 billion a month in 10 years time if nothing is done about the state of the budget. Under the legacy of the previous government, each Australian's share of the interest would be $9,400 over the next 10 years. In four years time alone, if nothing is done, every single Australian will be paying the equivalent of $740 in interest alone on Labor's debt - $740 each.                 To put that in perspective, as the IMF identified, we were left with a legacy of the third fastest growth in net debt of the surveyed countries by the IMF. What does that mean? That means that, ultimately, as interest rates rise, the punitive measures a future government would need to take to fix the budget would be more dramatic. We need to take action now. We must take action now, because the pain associated with taking action in the future would be far greater if we went down the path that the Labor Party is advocating - that is, do nothing. When you do nothing you become a victim of circumstances. When you take action you have at least a chance to control your destiny. The coalition is firmly of the view that we must take action now to repair the budget and to reduce the level of debt burden that is being passed on to future generations of Australians.

  I thank the member for his question. As he will be aware, I have just released the Cornall report, which goes into the full account, as best as is able to be determined, of what happened on that terrible and tragic night. In that report you will find detailed accounts from over 300 transferees of what occurred that night, as well as from many others who were involved in providing services and various things on that evening. It is important that, through our partnership with the Papua New Guinean government, that we meet our objectives and our undertakings with them to provide the support to ensure that that facility is well run and has all the appropriate safety measures in place.                  It is important that we continue this policy, because there seems to be an emerging theme here in this debate, which says that, because the boats are stopping, we can somehow ease off and maybe we should relax the policies. That is exactly the sort of thinking that I know comes from the Greens and from many of those opposite, which led to the Howard government's measures being taken away in the first place, which led to 50,000 people arriving on over 800 boats and which led to almost 1,200 deaths at sea, which are not occurring now because this government had the backbone to put in place the border protection policies that are saving thousands of lives.                 The Deputy Leader of the Greens may not know that, on 4 September last year, a young man, an asylum seeker who was released into the community under the policies favoured by the Greens, was stabbed to death in his apartment by, allegedly, another asylum seeker. I wonder whether the member opposite is going to take responsibility for that. But I am not asking him to do that, as he has sought to do by implying that to this government today. This government has taken the decisions that we needed to take on our borders that those opposite did not have the guts to do, did not have the wit to do, did not have the will to do and, as a result, it was cost, it was chaos and it was tragedy. That is what occurred under the watch of those opposite, ably supported, encouraged and pushed on by the Greens to drive them into the policies that led to the carnage that occurred on their watch. I would encourage everyone in this parliament to look at the report that we have released. What you will see in there is a policy that was announced by the previous government, to which they were dragged kicking and screaming, and their implementation, as always, was just never up to the job.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. He recognises, as I recognise, that the biggest problem that we have in trying to fix the budget is the person and the people who were responsible for the mess: the Australian Labor Party. I am glad to say to the Australian people, to the Prime Minister and to everyone that, as a result of our budget, we can reduce the debt legacy left by Labor by nearly $300 billion. But the impediment remains: the Australian Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition - a massive impediment. The first challenge they have is to recognise that there is a problem. Two weeks ago and the weeks before that, they were saying to the Australian people: 'There's no train wreck here; there's no problem. It's all okay. Everything would have been fine if we had been in government. It would have surged back to surplus.' You probably would have had the member for Lilley stand up here again and promise four years of surpluses, if Labor had been re-elected. Of course, we knew that was never going to happen. The only problem was that the Labor Party did not know.                 So now we have to deal with the problem and we are getting on with dealing with the problem. We have put in place savings measures that actually, over time, will not only reduce the legacy of debt and the legacy of higher interest payments but also give us a fair chance to give back to the Australian people the taxes that they pay so that we can continue to strengthen the economy and create more jobs. But the problem is that, like a sun that is gradually coming up on the horizon, Labor is starting to work out that there is a problem. In his budget-in-reply speech, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'There is a budget task' - a task! And the shadow Treasurer at the National Press Club said, 'Yes, there needs to be budget repair.'                  But the fact is that they are standing in the way by opposing $40 billion of savings - and $5 billion are savings they took to the last election as their promises. So Labor are not only trying to prevent us from keeping our promises; Labor are trying to prevent us from keeping their promises. The bottom line is that it adds to the tally. Labor are opposing their savings, they are opposing our savings and they are opposing the savings that are going to fix the budget.                 Sooner or later, they need to accept responsibility. After they accept responsibility, they need to provide an alternative. A credible Leader of the Opposition, with any personal integrity, would offer an alternative.

  It is pretty clear what members opposite are doing today. They are going through the budget striving to find losers. Every Australian was the loser from Labor's six years of incompetence. Every Australian will be the poorer because of Labor's six years of incompetence. This government knows that a lot of people are doing it tough, we know there is not an electorate in the country where there are not some people doing it tough, but we owe it to those people to get this economy back into shape and you cannot fix the economy without fixing the budget. That is what this government is doing. Every single month the people of Page are contributing to having to pay $1 billion in interest. That is $1 billion in dead money, that is $1 billion that could have been spent on fixing the Pacific Highway. That is the kind of thing we would be able to do sooner and better but for Labor's six years of incompetence. If the member for Richmond - I think I called her the member for Page earlier; we have a very good member for Page, a much better member for Page than we have member for Richmond - is serious about taking the burdens off the families of Richmond, tell her leader to scrap the carbon tax. If she is worried about promises, tell her leader to let this government keep its promise to scrap the carbon tax and scrap it now.

  I am pleased to get a question from the member for Hasluck on higher education. This budget is all about spreading more opportunity to students around Australia to get the chance to have a higher education qualification. How are we doing that? We are doing it in three ways: through the biggest Commonwealth scholarships fund in Australia's history; by uncapping the diplomas and associate degree courses that universities, typically regional and rural universities, offer so that thousands more Australians will get the chance to do a pathways program into a higher education degree; and by expanding the Commonwealth Grants Scheme to nonuniversity higher education providers. These three measures on their own inject an adrenaline shot of competition into the system. More importantly, they will expand higher education opportunities to 80,000 more students around Australia.                  In return, we are asking students to make a contribution to their own tuition fees. We are asking them to contribute, for those who enrol since 14 May, around 50-50 of the cost of their higher education. At the moment students contribute on average around 40 per cent, so that more than 60 per cent of Australians without a university degree are paying almost 60 per cent of the cost of those students who are at university and those students will go on to earn 75 per cent more than people without a university degree on average over the rest of their lifetime. So we think the current balance is not getting it right. We think a 40-60 balance between the taxpayer and the student is not fair to the taxpayer and all we are asking students to do is make a 50-50 contribution. I think that is a very fair contribution. You want to remember, Madam Speaker, that they can borrow every single dollar up-front and pay it back when they earn over $50,000 a year and only pay up to two per cent of their income once they start paying it back. It is a very generous deal.                 But do not just take my word for it. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, the member for Canberra, wrote a book called Battlers and Billionaires. He and the government on the side of the battlers, the rest of the Labor Party are on the side of the billionaires. He said on page 79: 'Compared with someone who finished year 12 but has no postschool qualification, a diploma boosts earnings by nearly 20 per cent while a bachelor's degree boosts earnings by more than $1 million over a lifetime.' So the member for Canberra gets it. He gets the fact that he and the government are trying to rebalance the contribution that students and taxpayers make, while the Labor Party continues to stand up for students, not taxpayers.

  Concessions are essentially a matter for the state governments and for local councils.                     My understanding is that of pensioner concessions some 90 per cent of the burden is quite properly and appropriately carried by the state government. If I could address the shadow minister's general point, yes, we are asking some sacrifices of our people.                      We are asking for some sacrifices, and everyone is making a contribution. As I said before, high-income earners are paying the deficit levy, members of parliament are forgoing a pay rise, motorists are bearing fuel excise indexation. This is a budget where all of us need to make a contribution so that all of us can be better off in the medium and long term.                 The sad truth is that every single Australian was a loser because of the incompetence of the former government. We did not cause the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite gave us.                     We are shouldering the responsibility of fixing it because that is what the Australian people expect of us, and we will not let them down.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and for his great interest in improving the health system in Central Queensland. It is very obvious to the Australian public by now that the coalition government is not only the greatest friend that Medicare has ever had but we are the only friend in this place that Medicare has.                     The Australian public is quickly working this out, and I will tell you the reason why.                     The changes we make in this budget will make Medicare sustainable for a generation to come. Labor's approach was to rack billions of dollars up onto the credit card, to give services away for free, pretending that that could happen forever. Let me say this: for a population of 23 million people, Medicare provides 263 million free services per year, and Labor was tracking Medicare onto an unsustainable basis. What Labor did to Medicare is what they did to the Australian economy. They racked up debt and put it on an unsustainable basis.                     What we do in this model is that we have $5 of a co-payment going into a $20 billion medical research future fund to find the cures of tomorrow and to make sure that we can have a sustainable health system going forward. Two dollars of the $7 goes back to GPs -                      Ten years ago we were spending $8 billion a year on Medicare; today we are spending $20 billion. It is projected in 10 years to go to $34 billion. Over the last five years we have increased expenditure by 42 per cent. You can live in this fantasy land that Labor is in, that somehow you can continue to rack up $1 billion each month of borrowed money to pay off the interest bill alone. You can pretend that, with an ageing population, you can give all of these free services away. Or you can take a responsible approach and you can put Medicare on a sustainable path. That is what this government has done. We will make sure, as our population ages, as we march towards a country that is going to have 7Â½ thousand people diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer's per week, that we can afford to -                      provide services for those people. That is the contrast between that incompetent opposition, who were dreadful government for this country, and this government, who will set up Medicare for generations to come. We will make sure we put Medicare back onto a sustainable path. People of the Australian public, I promise you, will not be tricked this incompetent opposition.

  The Leader of the Opposition has asked me to repeat something. Let me repeat this:                  _ there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all. As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc. And the idea is hardly radical.                 Why is the Leader of the Opposition embarrassed by this?                     I was asked about the co-payment and I am answering about the co-payment. Let me repeat:                  _ there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all. As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc. And the idea is hardly radical.                     It is hardly radical, because it is the shadow Assistant Treasurer. That is the shadow Assistant Treasurer.                     Why wouldn't the shadow Assistant Treasurer have said this, because the father of the co-payment was none other than -                      I congratulate the shadow Assistant Treasurer! But, while what he said was right, it was hardly original. It was hardly original because the father of the co-payment was none other than Prime Minister Bob Hawke himself - none other than Bob Hawke himself. Now, Bob Hawke was a real leader. Bob Hawke was a real reformer. This man is no Bob Hawke. This is right and fair and proper, and that is why it will happen under this government.

  I thank the member for Grey for his question. It is great to see him here in this House. He has been doing an extraordinary job. We came into parliament together and he has been an outstanding member. It is good to be serving with him. I can tell the member for Grey that one of the consequences of the coalition's strong border policies - where we have done exactly what we said we would do - is 158 days without a single successful people-smuggling venture to Australia.                     I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that it means there have not been deaths at sea, as a result of this policy over the more than five months where we have prevented those ventures from coming to Australia. I can tell the House that it is saving this budget $2Â½ billion - in this budget - whereas, under the previous government, it was blow-out after blow-out and a total of more than $11Â½ billion, which is approaching the annual interest bill that those opposite left us: we have to borrow $1 billion every month just to pay back the interest on their debt legacy.                 And 20,000 places have been freed up - 20,000 places have been freed up both this year and over the forward estimates to go to those people overseas who are waiting for a place. I notice those opposite have gone very quiet. A hush has come over the House. They are stunned into silence by their own failure, because as I look across their front bench what I see is a chorus of failure when it comes to immigration. We have two previous immigration ministers, one being my current penpal, the shadow minister for Nigeria, who wants to put it to us that we should be trying to release people convicted of drug-trafficking out into the community. That was his petition to me. That was his petition. And, if he does not cop to that, he has to tell his constituents that when he makes representations to ministers he does not mean it! He does not mean it at all. It is all clayton's work from the former minister.                 Now those opposite pretend to lecture this side of the House, having stuffed up Immigration, about how we should be running the finances of this country. There is a very real risk, the only risk to our borders going forward, and that is if there is a change of policy, and the only way that is going to happen is if that mob ever sits on this side of the House again. Already they are creeping back to doing exactly what Kevin Rudd did when he was Prime Minister and say: 'The boats are stopping. We don't have to do it anymore. We can relax the policies.' That same thinking is creeping into them now. They will never turn boats back where it is safe to do so. They will never have the backbone to do what we need to do on our borders. They never did and they never will.

  I do not accept the premise of the question. What I said was absolutely right. I refer the shadow minister to this outstanding booklet, the budget for 2014 on health, which says:                 Patient contributions will not be expected for many GP services that target patients with particular health needs, such as Health Assessments and Chronic Disease Management items.                  I know that he does not read a lot, but if he read this document he would see that what I said the other day was absolutely right. As the Prime Minister said, there is a great deal of hypocrisy about this line from the Labor Party.                  Bob Hawke was a real leader of the Labor Party. He had principles. He actually delivered a surplus, the last Labor surplus. Bob Hawke is a man of principle. He is a man that calls it as he sees it, and he said back in 1991 that he wanted to introduce a co-payment of $3.50 for each visit to the doctor and he was doing so because at that time the average number of visits to the doctor was about four per year. Now it is about 11 per year according to the Commission of Audit. The bottom line is that Labor thinks that this is a free ride.                      Labor used to believe in things. They used to have principles. Once upon a time they understood that you have to believe in things and have principles and undertake the actions in government that make sure that a safety net is sustainable. For example, if you believe the rhetoric and fearmongering from the Labor Party, you would think that a $7 co-payment by pensioners was the end of the road for 10 visits to the doctor a year. But under Labor, pensioners when they get a script from the doctor had to pay $6 for the first 60 scripts each year. So under Labor's modern integrity and under the principles that they believe to be true today, they say, no, pensioners should not pay for 10 visits to the doctor each year but they should pay for the first 60 scripts that the doctor issues. That is the hypocrisy from Labor. Not only were they the inventors of the co-payment, not only did they come up with it, and they invented the PBS co-payment - not only that - it is Labor that wanted to claim that Medicare was all their idea. Yet everything they are doing is undermining Medicare. The coalition is the best friend Medicare has -                      because we want Medicare to be sustainable and the Labor Party does not.

  I thank the member for Solomon for her question. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition who in his budget reply speech spoke about forgotten people on a number of occasions and never mentioned rural Australia once -                      that is not where the member for Solomon comes from. She understands regional Australia and why it is necessary for us to invest in infrastructure not just in our biggest capital cities but also in provincial and regional communities as well, and she will be particularly pleased about the coalition government's $600 million commitment to roads in the Northern Territory.                     Our commitments will make a real difference to much of the Territory's roads program. There is $70 million in Darwin for the Tiger Brennan Drive duplication, a project that has been underway for quite some time. This will take it some step further forward.                     I have noted the member for Lingiari's interjection. When I was in the Northern Territory last week, I heard him comment on the adequacy of road funding in the Northern Territory and, to his credit, he acknowledged the previous Labor government had not -                      I would be delighted to name dozens of projects across Australia, scores of projects which Labor had not had anything to do with. But since this question is about the Northern Territory, how about the Outback Way. Labor never spent a cent on the Outback Way. It was not prepared to spend anything on the Outback Way, and we are committing $20 million to the Outback Way in the Northern Territory. That is just one                     While I was in the Territory I also announced the $77 million Northern Territory Roads Package, which Labor had never funded and which will provide significant upgrades to the major roads of the Territory, and then $90 million to the Regional Roads Productivity Package. Labor is going to claim that this is its own, but in reality they did not spend any of it. The projects that they announced like the Santa Teresa Road and the Port Keats Road were not funded. I visited the Santa Teresa Road and not a thing was done. Nothing had happened. But with Chief Minister Giles I was able to announce the start of construction on that project and the Port Keats Road and $90 million of major roads upgrading in the Territory. We are getting on with the job. We are delivering for the Territory and the rest of Australia the roads network of the 21st century, roads they deserve that Labor never delivered.

  Let me just remind the member for Charlton of the commitments that this government made pre-election: to stop the boats, to stop the carbon tax -                      The commitments that we made pre-election were to stop the boats, to scrap the carbon tax, to build the roads of the 21st century and to get the budget back under control.                     There are no cuts to health, and every single dollar of saving in health is being reinvested - every single dollar of saving in health is being reinvested. And when it comes to public hospitals, public hospital funding increases by nine per cent this year, nine per cent next year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent in the fourth year - a massive increase. This is why, as the Treasurer says, the states are $9 billion better off as a result of this budget. Every Australian, in the long run, is better off under this budget because if you get the budget under control - if you fix the budget - you fix the economy and that makes every single Australian better off.                 If the member for Charlton is so anxious about things in the budget, and if he really wants to help the pensioners of his electorate, tell his leader to scrap the carbon tax now. Scrap the carbon tax now, and that would make every single household in the electorate of Charlton $550 a year better off.

  Can I commend the member for Gilmore for her great work on behalf of the constituents of Gilmore since she has been a member and, indeed, prior to being a member of this place. It has been a very consistent effort over a long period of time.                 As the member for Gilmore says, and contrary to what the Labor Party is claiming, the pension in Australia will continue to increase every six months. Twice yearly, the pension will continue to go up. Indeed, in March, just a month or two ago, under this government, the pension increased by up to $15.70 for singles per fortnight and up to $11.90 per fortnight for each member of a couple. That is almost $12 for each member of a couple and almost $16 for singles. And the pension will increase again this September. So, contrary to the claims of the Labor Party, who are running around the country suggesting that somehow pensions will not increase, they actually increased in March, they will increase in September, they will increase in March and September next year and they will continue to go up.                 But more than that, the increase of the pension in March was actually driven by the CPI - by the consumer price index - because of the wage levels. Indeed, from September 2017 we will do exactly that and ensure that the pension continues to increase by the CPI. So not only will the pension continue to increase every six months in this year so, too, will the pension supplement. It is currently up to $1,635.40 per year for singles and $2,464.80, again per year, for couples. That will increase again in September, along with the pensions themselves.                 So, this government is acting on cost of living for senior Australians and pensioners. They keep the energy supplement, worth up to $360 per annum for singles and $546 per annum for couples. Last October we reduced the deeming rates, and that has an immediate impact in terms of part pensions in particular. And we have done something which the Labor opposition never did, and that is we have indexed the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. So we are concerned for the cost of living of seniors and pensioners in Australia.                 This stands in stark contrast to the Labor Party, that ran a Ponzi scheme with the Commonwealth finances so much that we are borrowing a billion dollars a month just to pay the interest. Shame on you!

  It has not been axed: it is as simple as that - it has not been axed.                 I do reject the suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition - an unworthy suggestion, if I may say so - that this government or, indeed, myself as prime minister, are uninterested in this. Obviously, we want to do the right thing -                      by all people who are suffering, including people who are suffering the dreadful diseases that come from exposure to asbestos.                 Without wanting to, as it were, blow my own trumpet, when I was the health minister I did establish a national research centre for research into this terrible disease. So I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: before he gets into the politics of smear, check the facts.

  I thank the member for Barton for his question. I visited his electorate last week and I am very impressed with the level of engagement that he has with the ethnic communities in the seat of Barton.                     The Australian government has stabilised our foreign aid budget at just over $5 billion a year. In 2016 the foreign aid budget will increase from $5 billion a year by CPI.                   The member for Wakefield                    then                    left the chamber                   .                     We are focusing our aid effort on our region: the Indian Ocean, Asia-Pacific. It is where we live. It is where we have the most influence. It is where we can make the biggest difference. We are no longer raiding the aid budget to the tune of $740 million to plug a hole in the border protection budget. We are no longer moving $5.7 billion out of the aid budget when no-one is looking, as Labor had done. So we are providing certainty. It is affordable, it is responsible and it is sustainable. It means that the Australian government is still among the top 10 aid donors in the OECD world, in developed countries, and in our own region we are second only to Japan in terms of the amount of our aid budget. We have consulted with our partners and we are putting in place performance benchmarks and mutual accountability. This is the new aid paradigm that other developed countries are doing; Australia likewise is taking a new approach.                 But I do have to put this in context, because Labor's debt and deficit means that we have to borrow a billion dollars each and every month to pay the interest on Labor's debt. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was part of the former cabinet under the former Labor governments and so she ought to know better than anyone the train wreck that we inherited from Labor in terms of debt and deficit. Yet, sure enough, she puts out a press release on 14 May saying that Labor would be putting in an extra $16 billion to the aid budget. Labor commits to this additional $16 billion. Where does Labor think they are going to get that from? Well, they could continue to borrow. They could borrow $16 billion from overseas to send $16 billion back overseas. That is Labor's thinking. Then we would have to borrow money to pay the interest on the $16 billion that they borrowed from overseas to send back overseas. The alternative to borrowing is to cut more programs, so I would like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to tell us -                      which programs she intends to cut worth the $16 billion -                      that Labor says it will add to the aid budget. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, by this $16 billion commitment, has proven once more why Labor should never be trusted with taxpayers' money. I suggest that she listen to the words of Bob Carr: 'You can't run aid on borrowings.'

  I think that the shadow minister should tell the truth. Pensions have not been cut and they will not be cut. The shadow minister, frankly, demeans himself and he demeans this parliament when he suggests that they have. He should stop scaring pensioners - and while he is about it he should stop writing references for drug runners in Villawood.                 The Prime Minister has resumed his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business will have the call on a point of order.                     To assist the House -                      I am happy to withdraw.                     I am happy to withdraw and I am sorry that I did make that reference in respect of the member for Watson. I should not have done it. But he, equally, should not try to scare pensioners.                  The pension is not being cut. The pension will not be cut. Every six months under this government the pension will go up. As the Minister for Social Services has just pointed out, in March the single pension went up by some $15 and the couple pension went up by some $12. And it will happen in September and it will happen next March and it will happen next September. This will happen each and every year. Yes, come September 2017, the pension will increase by CPI as opposed to male total average weekly earnings. The best thing that we can do for the pensioners of Australia is make the pension sustainable. The best thing we can do for all Australians is get the budget back under control. The best thing we can do for our country, to honour our commitments, is take the necessary and the difficult decisions needed to secure this country's future. That is what we are doing: we are securing this country's future. And what are members opposite doing? They are worrying about who might be in what room, at what time, in this parliament. Really and truly, this man is no Bob Hawke. He is no Bob Hawke; he is no leader; and he has no answers for the difficulties our country faces.

  I am pleased to have a question from the member for Wannon who has fought very hard for his constituents on the matter of occasional child care. I visited his electorate in 2011 and met with UnitingCare. They had lost $15,000 in funding overnight without any consultation with the then minister. The service had been forced to reduce hours and raise fees. So I am pleased to reiterate the coalition's commitment to reinstating the $12.6 million in funding for occasional child care slashed by the former government. This will assist parents, particularly those in rural and remote areas such as Wannon.                 There are many reasons why families might need to access occasional child care - casual work, illness, unexpected life events; sometimes for rural and regional children it is the first important form of socialisation before school. Thousands of Victorian families rely on this form of child care operating from hundreds of centres across the state. Earlier this year I wrote to state and territory education ministers seeking their support for participation in the program, along with a commitment from them to meet 45 per cent of the cost as they did under the previous arrangement. I look forward to this form of child care getting back up and running after the previous government increased the cost to parents for child care, overall, by 50 per cent.                 This is a government that stands up for what we know to be right, not what we know to be easy. I think the worst thing that any of us can be accused of in this place is believing in nothing. I sat on the opposition benches for six years while two successive Labor prime ministers delivered five successive budget deficits, trashed the national accounts, trashed our economic credibility and ran up a billion dollars in interest payments every month - all in a desperate attempt to buy votes. It was a desperate attempt to buy votes by buying things the country did not need with money the government did not have and, with respect to the deal with the Greens, to impress people they did not even like. They were a Labor party that believed in nothing then and which believes in nothing now. By contrast, we stand here to make the difficult decisions for the good of the nation. I encourage members opposite to support our reinstatement of this vital form of child care.

  There are three false statements there. First of all, this is the budget that Australia needs right now to face Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Second, there were no $80 billion of spending in any budget that has been reduced by this government.                     I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to point to $80 billion in Labor budgets that were going to be spent on health and education. Finally, no advertising campaigns have been undertaken by this government. That contrasts with when the Leader of the Opposition was in government. Seven hundred million dollars were spent on political advertising by the former government.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I can point out to her that this country has a fundamentally strong economy, but under members opposite we had a fundamentally weak budget. The government is fixing the budget to strengthen our economy. This is exactly what we were elected to do. I said until I was blue in the face during the last election that we would do four things: we would stop the boats, we would scrap the carbon tax, we would build the road to the 21st century, and we would get the budget back under control.                     I can understand a certain amount of excitement from members opposite, because members opposite did not think the budget needed to be brought back under control. None other than the Leader of the Opposition said - he likes to talk about advertising, well here is a bit of false advertising that the Leader of the Opposition put out - he claimed, in a dodger distributed to his electorate, that the budget was -                    An incident having occurred in the                    chamber                    -                      The Leader of the Opposition claimed back in 2012 that the budget was back in surplus, on time and as promised. I know why he is turning his back; he is embarrassed by this. He said, 'in these uncertain global times, there is no clearer sign of a strong economy than a surplus' - the surplus he never, ever delivered, the surplus Labor never delivered and was incapable of delivering.                 What did we get from members opposite? We got the six biggest deficits in Australia's history. We got 200,000 more unemployed at the end of their six years than at the beginning. We got $123 billion of cumulative prospective deficits, $667 billion of projected debt and $1 billion a month in interest payments - every single month - just to pay the interest on the borrowings. They were paying the nation's mortgage on the credit card. It just could not go on; and it will not go on, thanks to this government.                  We are taking the tough decisions now to avoid even tougher decisions in four or five years time. We are taking the tough decisions now to set up the prosperity of the future. This is the first honest budget in six years. This is the budget our country needs.

  On this issue, as on so many others, the Leader of the Opposition is simply incapable of telling the truth. This is the Leader of the Opposition who could not be trusted by either of his two previous leaders. Kevin Rudd could not trust him; Julia Gillard could not trust him; and the Australian people should not trust him either.

  I am very grateful to the honourable member for Lyons for the question. He is actually asking about the details of the budget, and I am happy to respond -                      and focus on the fact that, if no action were taken, Australian government debt would increase to $667 billion within a decade - that is, $25,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia.                     Our interest bill alone in that time would be nearly $3 billion a month - $3 billion a month for the legacy of debt left by the Labor Party in just six years. In just six years they managed to lock in expenditure that left us with a trajectory of debt to $667 billion, with an interest bill of nearly $3 billion a month. And now the interest bill is over $1 billion a month for what Labor did over a six-year period. The fact is they have left us with the fastest growth rate in spending of the top 17 surveyed IMF countries in the world. They have left us with the third fastest growth in net debt of the 17 surveyed countries in the world.                 Labor say there is no problem - 'No tragedy here; no problem here' - because from their perspective they did nothing wrong. Well, they did. The first act of wrongness is their denial. We have heard about the War of the Roses, but I want to tell you about the 'War of the Bowens' - I want to tell you about the 'Battle of the Bowens'. The Bowen in the Labor Party seems to think that there is really no problem here, just a little budget repair job, but the Bowen who is the Parliamentary Budget Officer, appointed by the last parliament as the independent arbiter in these matters, said:                  It is time to start coming out -                  of debt and deficit -                  otherwise the longer you leave it the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind it back.                 That is the independent Bowen, the Bowen who knows what he is talking about. That Bowen - Phil Bowen, the Parliamentary Budget Officer - has belled the cat. He has proven the fact, as has every other independent analyst, that we need to act now to stop the debt getting out of control. The only way to do that is to back a budget that is honest. That comes as a rude shock to Labor - an honest budget! The fact is we have delivered an honest budget and we will fix the economy.

  Again, two falsehoods. We are not cutting $80 billion from schools and hospitals. There was no $80 billion in any Labor budget. There was no $80 billion in any Labor budget to be cut.                     So there was no $80 billion in any Labor budget, no $80 billion that Labor ever set aside in any Labor budget, that has been cut. All that is happening is that the rate of increase has been reduced because the rate of increase that members opposite were proposing is simply unsustainable. Let me make it crystal clear to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who cannot contain her excitement -                      Hospital funding increases by nine per cent this year, nine per cent next year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent the year after that. What sort of a cut is a nine per cent increase? What sort of a cut is a six per cent increase? I ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: what sort of a cut is a nine per cent increase?                     That is falsehood No. 1. Falsehood No. 2: there is no government advertising campaign, so please stop having the vapours about something that is not happening. Stop wasting questions. Members opposite are supposed to be so excited about this budget and they are already off the budget and onto a piece of confected fantasy. That is what they are doing.                 Given that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is incapable of asking a serious question in this place, let me offer a serious point and say thank you to our friends from Malaysia. Let me say how pleased I have been to work with the Malaysian government and how pleased I have been to work with Prime Minister Najib of Malaysia on the hunt for flight MH370, a search that goes on and a search that this government will continue to prosecute. We owe it to the families of the 239 people on that flight not to rest until we can solve this mystery.

  I thank the member for Mitchell for his question because he knows how important it is to remember experiences from the past. Of course, the fact is that the experience that we are dealing with is that Labor left $667 billion of debt and $123 billion of deficits. When the Labor Party are challenged about what they would do about this very significant structural problem, they say: 'Don't worry. When we were in government we had $180 billion of savings.' I thought: 'Wow, $180 billion of savings. Let's go a bit into that,' because you have to peel it apart like an onion to find out what it really is. In fact, nearly half of it is increases in taxes - not savings, but actual increases in taxes.                     In fact, their definition of savings is about taking more savings from the Australian taxpayer.                     That is the Labor Party's definition of savings. And then the second part of the $180 billion -                      I'm coming to you, china, in a minute - just a second. With the second part of the $180 billion, I thought, 'Wow, they saved $180 billion'. But they spent $152 billion of it on new expenditure. The problem was the expenditure kept going up and up and up, and that is why we are facing $667 billion of debt.                 The fact is Labor once upon a time believed in structural reform. You know, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, they believed in structural reform. In fact I went to the member from McMahon's book and found that he said:                 The Hawke Government was introducing tough and controversial reforms to modernise the economy. _ I knew that Labor was trying to make the economy grow so that kids like me could get better jobs.                 If that is the case, then he should now be rusted on to our structural reforms that deliver a stronger economy. Instead, the Labor Party cannot hold a policy from week to week. They terminated the carbon tax, but now they are voting to keep it. Three weeks ago they said they were totally opposed to the deficit levy, now they are going to support it. And yesterday they were backgrounding that they were going to allow through the government's proposals in relation to the family tax benefit and then, today, they come out and say, no, they have reversed their position. So if Labor cannot hold a position from day to day and if Labor cannot hold a position from week to week, there is no chance, no chance on earth -                      that this Labor Party, which has no soul and has no principles, is ever going to deal with the structural challenges facing the Australian economy. The Labor Party of today has no principles, has no values, has no leadership.

  I thank the honourable member for McMahon for the question. If he is concerned about a stinking carcass, he only needs to look in front of him at the Leader of the Opposition. And why so? Because it is the Leader of the Opposition who is the custodian of the legacy -                      Well I think -                      I withdraw. And it is not terribly dignified at all, is it? But of course they asked the question. And it was a former Labor Prime Minister -                      I'm sorry - what are you saying?                     Are you okay? Are you coping? Are you all right?                     Calm down. I know it's a bit tough for you -                      It is not terribly edifying, but it was a former Labor Prime Minister who stood at this very dispatch box and used that term and it is now the current Labor Party that chooses to repeat that term.                     I will tell you why: if we are dealing with legacies, the greatest legacy Labor has left is 200,000 more Australians unemployed. The greatest legacy Labor has left is $123 billion of deficits. The greatest legacy Labor has left is $667 billion of debt. And now that they are in opposition they are trying to create a new legacy, because they are opposing $40 billion of savings that are going towards fixing the mess that they created. They started the fire in the kitchen, and now they are trying to stop the fireman from putting it out.                 Of course they think it is funny, they think it is humorous; they think it is clever politics. You see the Labor Party's response to the entire budget has been about politics and process, not about policy - and why? I will tell you why. They were the architects of the co-payment in Medicare, they were the architects of the co-payment for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, they were the ones who first introduced university fees - the Labor Party were when they actually did have principles. The coalition supported them in those reforms because we knew we had to do what was right for the country even when we were in opposition.                 But now the modern Labor Party has no principles, it has no values, and it has no leadership. That is reflected in the fact that the modern Labor Party does not know what to support and want to oppose from day to day. That is the legacy of the modern Labor Party. I say to you: the people who should be most concerned about that are the Australian people, because there has always been a bipartisan approach to fix and strengthen the Australian economy. The only obstacle today, the only thing swinging in the breeze, is the modern Labor Party.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question and for his representation of his constituents in the seat of Banks. I can say to the member for Banks that I came across an interesting observation just recently. Let me quote:                   In terms of life expectancy, 70 is the new 64.                 Indeed, the person who wrote this went on and said:                 And in terms of health, 74 is the new 64.                 _ Â Â Â _ Â Â Â _Â Â Â                  Yet to look at many of the statutes on our books, you would think that none of these changes had ever occurred.                 So I was wondering, who made this prescient and astute observation about 70 being the new 64? Who could it have been who made this observation? Well, he is here in the House. Not on the side of the House but the member for Canberra.                     I thought: what an astute and prescient observation about the demographic changes that are occurring in society. Andrew, come on over! The reality is that there is a major change in the demographic patterns in Australia. People are living much longer. When the age pension was introduced in 1907, average life expectancy was less than 60. Today it is well over 80, as the member for Canberra pointed out.                     The member for Fraser. I apologise to the member for Canberra. And I would say to the member for McMahon, at least the member for Fraser's books sell more than yours do. There is a great demographic change occurring and that is reflected in the fact that this government is going to ensure that the age pension remains sustainable.                 The member for Banks asked, 'Is the age pension going to continue to increase?' Yes, it will - twice a year. In March of this year the age pension increased by $15.70 a fortnight for singles and it increased by $11.90 fortnight for each of a couple. Again in September of this year the age pension will increase, as it will in March and September 2015, and 2016, and 2017. The nonsense that the Labor Party is going on about the age pension is simply, once again, factually incorrect. Under this government the age pension will be sustainable and will continue to increase.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I do declare an interest: I do pay insurance up there and the insurance has gone through the roof, particularly since Cyclone Larry.                 The insurance premiums - which are being compounded by the insurance taxes, GST and so on, on the top of insurance - have risen enormously over the last few years, particularly in relation to body corporates. This is something that the member for Leichhardt has been incredibly aggressive about. He has belted down the door to my office. Perhaps I will temper that by saying he has been assertive rather than aggressive. He has been ringing the bell on this for some period of time.                  This is something that the Assistant Treasurer has been working through with the insurance industry. There are some challenges, particularly in relation to reinsurance. Ultimately, the costs of reinsurance end up being directly linked to events that occur in a region. The fact that insurance premiums have risen so dramatically, particularly in North Queensland has unquestionably been linked to increased reinsurance costs. Also, obviously, one of the reasons reinsurance costs have increased is because of the very significant events that have occurred up there, including recent cyclones.                 The net impact of that is that people either underinsure or do not insure. Australia, unfortunately, has a fairly high level of under-insurance.                     That is not right, because the insurance premium increases are applied across the board - effectively, right across North Queensland. So it is not isolated to a particular class. For example, body corporate insurance has increased so significantly in the last six years, but other classes of insurance have also increased due to the increased cost of reinsurance but also because of market concentration up there. Market concentration is an issue particularly in relation to body corporate insurance.                  Having said that, I want to be able to report to you, in the next few weeks, exactly what has come out of the discussions between the Assistant Treasurer and the insurance companies in relation to this matter, because it is something that has been raised repeatedly by my colleague the member for Leichhardt and the member who was recently ejected from the House, the member for Herbert. The fact is that this affects the whole of Queensland and it is a serious issue.

  The truth, which members opposite are in denial about is that we could not go on borrowing $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on Labor's borrowings. We simply cannot go on like that. The budget is this government's attempt to deal with Labor's budget mess. Where is Labor's?                     There were a lot of tough decisions in this budget, and it is good that members opposite have noticed that there are some tough decisions in this budget. There is no easy way to deal with the debt and deficit disaster that Labor has left this country. In the budget this government has carefully explained to the Australian people what we propose to do to deal with the mess that Labor created, and now it is up to the Leader of the Opposition to say how he will fix the mess that he helped to create. Let's face it: the Leader of the Opposition was a senior minister for almost six years in the government that gave us the six biggest deficits in history. He was the kingmaker who put Julia Gillard into the prime ministership. Then, when that was not good enough for him, he was the kingmaker who put Kevin Rudd back into the prime ministership. So if he was good enough and Machiavellian enough to make and unmake prime ministers, please tell us, Leader of the Opposition, what you would do to fix the debt and deficit disaster.                 The Leader of the Opposition helped to make the mess. He should explain how he is going to fix it. We have been absolutely upfront with the Australian people about our solution for Labor's mess. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to be equally honest with the Australian people. They are the fire; we are the fire brigade. I refuse to be impartial as between the fire brigade and the fire.

  I thank the member very much for her question. All of the members on this side are very proud that in this budget we increase hospital funding every single year. And we increase it by a record amount. The fact is that in this budget hospital funding increases by over $5 billion or around 40 per cent over the next four years.                  I am very proud that we have been able to deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster, that we have been able to pay down Labor's debt, and that at the same time we have been able to increase by record amounts the money that we put into our public hospitals. The reality is, as the Prime Minister said earlier in question time: each year over the next three years we will increase hospital funding by nine per cent and, in the fourth year, we will increase it by over six per cent. We inherited enormous debt when we came into government and, as has been rightly pointed out, we are borrowing $1 billion a month just to pay the interest bill. If we did not make changes over the course of the next 10 years, that monthly interest bill would grow to $2.8 billion.                  If we did not get Labor's debt under control, it would mean we would have to take tough decisions and it would mean that in future years we would have had to cut hospital funding - which, in this budget, we do not do. We are increasing hospital funding each and every year as we go forward. I am very proud of the fact that we have been able to manage Labor's debt and deficit disaster and that we will increase by $1.3 billion the funding that will flow to state hospital services over the course of the next year. In 2015-16 there will a nine per cent increase or more to $1.4 billion in that year. In 2016-17 we are increasing hospital funding across the country by nine per cent or $1.5 billion. We will increase hospital funding going forward on a sustainable path.                 In this country, 10 years ago we had 2.5 million people over the age of 65. In 10 years' time there will 4.5 million people over the age of 65, and we have to make the changes today to make sure that our hospital system and our health system are strengthened into the future. But, if we do not deal with Labor's debt and deficit now, we will not be able to provide the $15 billion a year that we are providing this year, and which is growing each and every year, toward our public hospitals around the country. The coalition was elected to clean up Labor's mess not just in relation to the boats and the economy but in relation to the health portfolio as well. We will take money away from those great big new health bureaucracies that they created. We will put it back into front-line services. That is why we have put the health system on a sustainable path as our population goes forward.

  Again there were many falsehoods in that question. Let me quote from someone - I am not sure that he is a wise man but he has certainly said some wise things:                 But there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all. _ the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc.                 And the idea is 'hardly a radical idea'. It is an idea which certainly appeals to Labor's shadow Assistant Treasurer. I can understand that the shadow Assistant Treasurer could be fairly uncomfortable, but come on over! If you don't like it there, come on over!                     Labor's shadow Assistant Treasurer is not the only person who supports the government on this issue. Labor's former prime minister, Mr Hawke, the father of the co-payment, supports what this government is doing.                     There are a whole range of ways to get immunised. Yes, a GP is one way, but there are also community health centres and other ways of being immunised. It is very important that immunisation rates stay up, and this government certainly supports that.

  I thank the member for Wright for his question. I can tell him that the higher education budget is all about spreading opportunity to more students to get a higher education qualification. How are we doing that? We are doing it through the biggest Commonwealth scholarships fund in Australia's history, through the extension of the Commonwealth Grants Scheme to non-university higher education providers, through lifting the cap on diploma and associate degrees so that it is a demand-driven system so that tens of thousands more students will have the opportunity to go to university and do pathways programs, and through abolishing the loan fees for VET students and for students in non-university higher education providers to access the Higher Education Loan Program.                  Through these measures we will create 80,000 more places at university, and most of those will be filled by low-socioeconomic status students, by students from disadvantaged backgrounds and by first-generation university goers. And, yes, we are also deregulating fees. Every single dollar of those deregulated fees will be able to be borrowed by the student from the Australian taxpayer at the same interest rate as the government borrows that money on behalf of the student; they can pay it back after they earn $50,000 a year and they cannot pay back more than two per cent of their income at the lowest threshold. Imagine going to the bank and saying to the bank manager, 'I'd like to borrow a credit card for $16,800' - which is the average HECS debt in 2012 - 'but there are a few conditions that I am going to put on this loan. I'm not going to pay it back at greater than the 10-year government bond rate, I'm not going to start paying it back until I earn over $50,000 a year, and I'm only going to pay back two per cent of my income.' The bank manager would look askance at the customer, but that is exactly what the taxpayer provides right now for students at universities around Australia. For the 750,000 students, that is the loan that the taxpayer gives students so that they can go on to higher education and so they can earn 75 per cent more than the 60 per cent of Australians without a university degree. It is the best loan that a student will ever get.                 The Leader of the Opposition, in responding to this, reminds me of Thurston Howell III. He is wandering around Gilligan's Island offering champagne to all his friends and saying, 'We can provide champagne to everyone.'                     But just like Thurston Howell III, he does not have champagne to give. He did not have it in government and he will not have it in the future. We are being honest with the Australian public and honest with students; whereas Thurston over there thinks that he can have his cake and eat it too - but, unfortunately, he cannot.

  It is very important that we make Medicare sustainable for the long term. That is what we are trying to do. It is very important that we make Medicare sustainable for the long term. What this government will not do is do what members opposite have done for far too long and pretend that we can continue to borrow at unsustainable rates to provide services that simply cannot be afforded.                     There is nothing wrong with a co-payment.                     The shadow minister who is yelling across the table thinks that it is perfectly fair to have a co-payment for the PBS, does she not? Suddenly, for once, that shadow minister is silent. For once that shadow minister is silent. It is perfectly fair, is it not -                      It is perfectly fair to have a co-payment for PBS drugs. Members opposite introduced a co-payment for the PBS. They introduced a co-payment for Medicare. If a co-payment for the PBS is perfectly fair enough, why is there something fundamentally wrong with a co-payment for Medicare?                 Members opposite do not like me quoting the Labor Assistant Treasurer on one subject. Let me quote him again:                 FAR too often ... proponents of social change call for a return to old-style tax and spend policies, large government handouts and government intervention in the economy _ Unfortunately, this brand of well-intentioned social and economic Luddism would visit yet more suffering and exclusion on those very people in need of assistance.                     Madam Speaker, he is right about co-payments and he is right about the economic policies of his own colleagues - economic Luddism. We cannot afford to go on in this way anymore - and, as far as this government is concerned, we never ever will.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. For six years the Labor government worked not towards the light on the hill but towards the great liability on the hill. That was their effort - six years towards that big liability. One of the major components of that was the delusion that the National Broadband Network would be a wonderful investment. Indeed, when it was first announced by Prime Minister Rudd, he said it was going to be so fantastic that mums and dads would be lining up to invest in it. You could just imagine the government bringing in the crowd control barriers and training the Australian Federal Police to link arms to hold back the hordes of anxious investors desperate to get their stake! But Prime Minister Rudd said, 'No, no; you can only have 49 per cent.' Well, that fantasy did not last very long.                 But even as recently as the middle of last year, Senator Conroy and Senator Wong were out there claiming the project would generate a rate of return of seven per cent and they said -                      Speaking of the bar, Education Minister, it reminds me again of the late Neville Wran's great line: 'Anyone can go to jail if they get the right lawyer.' We are constantly reminded of that every time the member for Isaacs gets up.                 The Labor Party's NBN, had it been continued with, would have had a peak funding requirement of $73 billion -                      which would have amounted to more than 10 per cent -                      I would ask the honourable member to withdraw, Madam Speaker. I am wounded! She has offended the House!                     Thank you. I am feeling a bit better now, thank you, Madam Speaker. I am very sensitive!                  Had the Labor Party stayed in office, within the decade we would have had $667 billion of debt -                      and more than 10 per cent of that would have been contributed by their misguided National Broadband Network project. So what are we doing? Well, we cannot recover most, if any, of the billions they have wasted to date, but what we can do is finish the project sooner, cheaper and more affordably. It will be cheaper for consumers and over $30 billion less expensive for taxpayers. The government is very much in the position of Mr Wolf in that great movie Pulp Fiction, cleaning up the mess - but the difference is that, in that movie, John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson helped cleaned up the mess they made and did not, like the Labor Party, get in the way of the clean-up.

  How can members opposite seriously say that a modest co-payment for visiting the GP will stop sick people from visiting the doctor, when they do not contend that a modest co-payment for the PBS is no such disincentive?                     I ask you, Madam Speaker, how can they say that co-payments for Medicare are wrong and co-payments for the PBS are right? They simply cannot sustain the logic of their position. Their position is simply untenable. Now we have this slightly sad attempt by members opposite to say that people are going to be deprived of vital health treatment because of the same modest co-payment on Medicare that people have always faced in respect of the PBS. Let me read something: 'Is anyone seriously suggesting that, in the circumstance you're talking about, where there is the possibility - '                     I am quoting something that is very relevant: 'Is anyone seriously suggesting that, in the circumstance you're talking about, where there is the possibility of breast cancer, that is going to stop them going to the doctor? I mean, that is emotionalism being played at the lowest level.' That was Prime Minister Bob Hawke, a real Labor leader, unlike this tawdry excuse for a leader sitting opposite.

  I thank the member for Longman for his question. I know taxpayers in his electorate will be pleased to know that it has been 159 days since the last successful maritime people-smuggling venture to this country and they will also be interested to know that, over the same period last year, there were 157 such successful ventures to Australia and over 10,000 - 10,396 - arrivals. The dividends that have flowed from this government's successful policies are both the humanitarian dividend and, of course, the economic dividend.                     The humanitarian dividend is of course important because over that same period of 159 days there have been no deaths at sea by people seeking to come to this country. I note that it is important to be across the facts of this issue, particularly if you are operating in this portfolio area. I notice that the shadow minister today, speaking at the Press Club, made the statement that there had been no deaths at sea since 19 July. That is a false statement because he should know that there have been 79 deaths at sea since 19 July. He should know that. I think that calls into question this shadow minister's ability to get across the facts, to understand the issues and to be competent in the portfolio. On all those criteria, under the previous government he would have sat satisfactorily as a minister for immigration, based on their performance.                 There is also a $2.5 billion boat-stopping dividend in this budget. Those opposite remain in denial about the problem, as we heard today. They also remain in denial about the solution to the problem. They deny their culpability in border protection failure, that they started the boats, and they deny the fact that this government has been successful to date in stopping the boats. But there is method to their mad denial because they know, if they accept the fact that this coalition's policies are doing exactly what they said they would do, then they would have to adopt them and they would have to keep them. We know, if they were ever to return to these benches, they would turn back on turnbacks, that is for sure. They would turn back on turnbacks. They would roll over on offshore processing. It would only be a matter of time because they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to introduce it. They would be rolled over by their backbench before long and they would continue to honour the promise of people smugglers for those who had arrived illegally by boat by giving them permanent visas.                 This government has a plan to stop the boats which is working and is opposed by those on the other side of the House. We have a plan to fix this budget, which is opposed by those sitting on that side of the House.

  There has been no cut.                       It is quite common for an underspend in one area of a portfolio to be spent in another area of the portfolio. The government has budgeted $377 million - let me repeat that: the government has budgeted $377 million - for this royal commission, until the middle of 2016, because we want this commission to do its work. I would be fairly confident that by the time it is finished this will be well and truly the best funded royal commission in Australia's history. And it should be, because this is an abhorrent crime. It is deplored by this government - and indeed by all members of this House - and the royal commission should be supported to get on and do its job, and it will be by this government.

  This is an important question from the member for Pearce and I thank him for it. The sad truth is that Labor's debt is costing this Commonwealth $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on the borrowings. In 10 years time, had members opposite continued in government, it would not have been $1 billion a month it would have been $3 billion a month in dead money, spent in interest repayments on the borrowings.                      That is $1 billion, even now, that is not available for schools, for hospitals and for roads. If we did have that saving of $1 billion a month, because were not paying for Labor's debt and deficit, in three months we could build the Western Sydney infrastructure package, in six months we could duplicate the Pacific Highway from Newcastle to the Queensland border, in little over 12 months we could fully build the East West Link in Melbourne and in just one month we could almost conclude the Perth Gateway and the Swan bypass. But we just have not got that $1 billion a month, because that is paying Labor's debt bill. That $1 billion a month is paying Labor's debt bill.                  They gave us the six biggest deficits in our history. They would have given us, had they been re-elected, four more years of record deficits. They would have given us a decade of deficits, had they been re-elected. Every year of deficit is just more debt for our children to repay. They were stealing from our future. It was intergenerational theft from members opposite. The budget is this government's plan to fix Labor's debt. Where is Labor's plan to fix Labor's mess? Let's face it, we had the good Bowen from the Parliamentary Budget Office give some advice to the bad Bowen, just the other day. The good Bowen said: 'It is time to start coming out of debt and deficit; otherwise, the longer you leave it the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind back.'                 This government has taken tough decisions today so that we do not have to take even tougher decisions in the future. Australians expect their governments to take the tough decisions, not to squib them.

  I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for her question and note that, because we have laid down a budget that asks people to contribute so that we can build, that is how we are able build the East West Link in Victoria, which is going to make a substantial difference in Melbourne and also to Geelong - cutting three hours of travel time from Geelong into Melbourne each week, which is a productivity improvement. But we can only do that if we are allowed to get on with the job of fixing the mess that was left behind by Labor.                 They have left us $667 billion of debt if no action is taken immediately - in 10 years time $667 billion of debt. That is $25,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia as a result of what Labor did in just six years. That is nearly $3 billion a month in interest. Even now we are paying about $1 billion a month in interest on the debt left behind by Labor. And here is the interesting thing: 70 per cent of that $1 billion a month goes to people living overseas who we have borrowed money from. Seventy per cent of that money, $700 million, every month is being sent by the Australian government to people who are living overseas to pay the interest on the debt that Labor left behind.                     They do not get it. They do not actually understand the implications of their spending decisions. When Labor were handing out $900 cheques, even to dead people overseas, and building massively expensive school halls -                      and when they were running all those deficits, someone had to pay. We had to borrow the money, and 70 per cent of that money has come from people living overseas. So now we have to pay the interest back on that debt. Labor think there is no problem. The Labor Party are in denial - not just about what they have done but also about the challenge for the future. That is why they are opposing $40 billion of savings, of which $5 billion of those savings were promises they made at the last election which they now want us to break. Their own savings they oppose.                 Now we have a clear situation of the hypocrisy of Labor. They are opposing the savings they took to the last election which would fix the budget; they are now opposing a co-payment on Medicare, which they originally came up with; they are now opposing freezing of family tax benefits, which they did in government; and they are now opposing changes to university fees, which they initially introduced. They have no principles. They are outright hypocrites - but Australia is paying.                     I will withdraw.

  Assuming that I am in my current job - and I make no assumptions about longevity - I can assure you that I will be in the top marginal tax bracket. I will be in the top marginal tax bracket, which means, yes, I will be continuing to make a very considerable contribution to the task of repairing Labor's debt and deficit disaster.                     The tragedy which members are still in denial about is that every single Australian will be paying for their debt and deficit disaster for many, many years to come. That is problem. When we have six years of utter incompetence, six years of utter betrayal of everything they once said they stood for, everyone pays. That is the problem: everyone has been a loser from the last six years of Labor's debt and deficit disaster.

  I thank the member for Dobell for her question and commend her on the fine representation of the people of Wyong, The Entrance and surrounding areas on the Central Coast of New South Wales.                     I can assure the member for Dobell and everybody in the House and everybody listening to this question time this afternoon that pensioners will keep their pension supplement. They are currently receiving up to $1,635 per annum as a single and up to $2,464 per annum as couples. Not only will they keep that pension supplement but I can also assure the member that that pension supplement will increase again in September. But this has not stopped the Labor Party from claiming otherwise.                     Laugh as you like. Keep laughing.                      I came across a brochure which clearly says: 'Age pensioners lose $876 per annum seniors supplement'. This brochure is authorised and printed by Senator Doug Cameron. I have news for Senator Cameron and the Labor Party: age pensioners do not receive the seniors supplement - they never have. They did not receive it under you. They do not receive it now. But that does not stop Mr Cameron running around the country saying that they will lose this.                     Madam Speaker, over all the rabble opposite, what we see once again is a pattern of deceit and deception from the Labor Party. But what is worse about this is that -                      So what is worse about this is that the person who is currently responsible for these -                      services for the Labor Party, responsible for such payments, cannot even get his facts right. So the Leader of the Opposition should either condemn Senator Cameron for this scaremongering -                      or stand him down and get somebody else to do the job. The reality is, I can assure the member for Dobell and everybody else in Australia, pensions will continue to go up. They went up in March, they will go up in September, and the pension supplement will indeed continue to increase and remain in existence.

  Madam Speaker -                      Madam Speaker, all I can say to the member for Jagajaga is 'come in spinner', because the reality is that, contrary to the lies that are being peddled by the Labor Party around Australia, lies like this one from Senator Cameron, the pension will continue to increase and the pension supplement will continue to be paid. That is the reality.                     The first stage of the grieving process is denial, and hasn't the Labor Party got it in heaps - total denial that you engaged in deception and deceit on the Australian people. As the Treasurer pointed out, we are racing towards an accumulated debt of $25,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Why don't you get real and face up to the situation that you left this country in? Why don't you face up to it rather than sitting there with this rabble of denial that we continue to get from the Labor Party? The reality is pensions will continue to rise in March and September -                      They have had a point on relevance, Madam Speaker.                     Madam Speaker, I would hate to accuse you of misleading the Australian people like the Labor Party is; but that is what is happening. So, in their total state of denial, you have people like Senator Cameron running around Australia trying to scare the pensioners of Australia that they are going to lose their pensions and that they are going to lose their pension supplement. The reality is in March of this year the pensions went up between about $10 and $15 for Australian pensioners, they will go up again in September of this year, they will go up again in March of next year and in September of next year, and the year after and the year after and the year after. That is the reality. And the pension supplement will be maintained and the pension supplement will increase in September this year. So it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition showed some gumption and some leadership and told Senator Cameron to stop this pattern of behaviour of running around and pretending that something is the case which is not the case for the pensioners of Australia. Shame on the Labor Party.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. Loath as I am to disagree with the member, I do respectfully suggest to him that the former Labor-Green government was a much bigger brake on Tasmania's economic development than the Bass Strait! This government here in Canberra and, I am sure, the new government in Hobart do want to contribute seriously to Tasmania's economic development because Tasmania needs to be a great place to work as well as a great place to live and a great place to visit. Members on this side, like the member for Denison, want to ensure that Tasmania is an economy as well as simply a national park.                 To that end, we are contributing $400 million towards the duplication of the Midland Highway. I confirmed $26 million towards upgrading the Brooker Highway. There is some $40 million being contributed towards the upgrade of Hobart airport. The coalition invented the Freight Equalisation Scheme, we support the Freight Equalisation Scheme, we have no plans to change the Freight Equalisation Scheme, and that is why $114 million was committed to the Freight Equalisation Scheme every year in the budget just brought down.

  I am delighted to get a question from the member for Petrie about the budget and about higher education in particular, because this government's reforms to higher education are designed to do two things: they are designed to spread the opportunity to more Australians to get a higher education qualification and they are designed to equip our universities with the freedom that they need to be able to thrive and be the best they possibly can be in order to compete with the Asian competitor universities in our region. We are doing that through the largest Commonwealth scholarships fund in Australia's history and by removing the cap on diplomas and associate degrees so that up to 80,000 more young people will get the opportunity, over time, to get a diploma, associate degree or undergraduate degree. We are extending the Commonwealth Grants Scheme to non-university higher education providers to give a shot of competition to the market and also expand opportunities for more students. We are abolishing the loan fees for VET, vocational education and training, and non-university higher education courses which have been a disincentive to students to go to those kinds of institutions. And we are deregulating universities.                 Some of the myths that have been put about about deregulating universities are that deregulation will lead to fewer young people of low socioeconomic status going to university and that it will lead to a reduction in enrolments. I think it is instructive to look at the experience of England and Scotland after the deregulation of fees in England and the abolition of fees in Scotland, because they both occurred at about the same time and the results are starting to come in. I must admit I have been helped by the Guardian website - unusually so. Daniel Carr from theguardian.com wrote a very good piece yesterday, exposing the fact that the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service in the UK found:                 Compared with entry rates in 2011, the year before the introduction of higher tuition fees in England, 18 year olds in disadvantaged areas in England are 12 per cent more likely to enter in 2013.                 It also found:                 _ the share of disadvantaged background students entering university is now at its highest in a decade.                 That is what has been found in Great Britain after the deregulation of fees: more students from poorer backgrounds are at university today than before deregulation. In Scotland, fees were abolished. In an article in TheTelegraph, Professor Riddell from Edinburgh university's school of education found:                 _ the proportion of students from low income backgrounds has not changed since fees were abolished _                 So the abolition of fees in Scotland led to no change at all in the number of poorer students going to university, but the change in England meant that more students got to go to university than before deregulation -

  This question is typical of the hypocrisy and incoherence of the Labor Party, because the Leader of the Opposition, when he was education minister, was in part responsible for a cut to the budget of the CSIRO. How can it be that there is a sense of absolute disaster and moral outrage when there is a modest cut to the CSIRO by this government, when there was an equal cut to the CSIRO when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister? The Leader of the Opposition thinks that, if Labor cuts the CSIRO, that is a great thing for our country, but for some reason a similar action from this government is wrong. No-one can take this opposition seriously. No-one can take this opposition seriously, and that question proves it.

  I thank the member for Moore for his question. He has shown strong support for the coalition's strong border protection policies. It has been 160 days since the last successful people-smuggling venture to Australia, and to get those results you must be consistent, you must have resolve and you must follow through.                      People smugglers can recognise jelly in the back of a government when they see it. They can recognise it, and they recognised the jelly in the back of the previous government when it came to border protection in their four failed immigration ministers who now litter of the front bench of the opposition. The Australian people can see the jelly in the back of this Leader of the Opposition too, who still refuses to acknowledge the success of this government to date in fixing the mess that their government left behind. They remain in denial about the problem and they remain in denial about the solution that this government is putting in place.                 Yesterday we heard a new excuse from the shadow minister about why the boats started again under the Labor Party. We have heard the push factors and all those issues, but yesterday we heard that it is because the people smugglers had access to technology. So it was not Kevin Rudd's fault; it was Steve Jobs's fault that the boats started again. He blames the iPhone for the boats coming back under the Labor Party. What are we going to hear from next - that the budget deficit is the result of the cloud raining down debt and deficit on the budget?                     This opposition is in denial about the problem they have left for this government and they are in denial about the solutions this government is putting in place.                  We need to stay the course on border protection and those opposite would change it all because they oppose the successful border protection policies of this government. They will turn back on turnbacks, you can be sure of that. This government will not be turning on turnbacks, you can be assured. We will stay the course and we will follow through on offshore processing. We will never roll over like they always will on offshore processing. It is in their DNA to do it. We will follow through on ensuring that people who are processed offshore will not be settled in Australia. That is why we are talking to Cambodia. Perhaps the former immigration minister has a Nigerian solution he wants to put forward before this parliament to follow through on what he said would happen and that no-one would be resettled in Australia. We are going to follow through and make sure that happens and we will never honour the people smugglers' promise, which the opposition still wants to do, by providing permanent visas to those who came illegally by boats.                      It will not happen under this government.

  I do not accept that the Education Union analysis is gospel.                      Trust the Leader of the Opposition, the former union official, to treat the national tertiary education union 'analysis' as gospel!                      No-one else does. I am not going to give the guarantee that the Leader of the Opposition seeks, but I can give a guarantee that no sensible institution would price itself out of the market. It is as simple as that. If this particular former union official had as much gumption as another former union official who once led the Labor Party, he would not ask silly questions like that. But the one thing you do know about this former union official is that he is no Bob Hawke.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. As at the date of the election, $6Â½ billion had been borrowed by the Commonwealth and put into the NBN to deliver a service to less than three per cent. The project was less than three per cent complete. The Labor Party's approach to the NBN is all on the same level as its approach to the budget - denial of reality. At the time they lost office, they said that this project was on time and on budget. Every single forecast, every single target had been missed. It was running way behind time, way behind forecast and way over budget. The strategic review which was published in December, an independent piece of work, demonstrated that the Labor NBN, had they been allowed to continue, would have cost peak funding and the total amount it would have cost, the most money - $73 billion. That was a hit on the taxpayer. That is all money that had to be provided or serviced or guaranteed in some way by the taxpayer.                     We certainly did have the same problem yesterday, and I suspect every day that the honourable member is present in the chamber.                 The reality is this: this denial of the facts and denial of the truth has bedevilled the Labor Party's approach to business, to the budget, to the NBN and to every aspect of its administration. One of the things that we have been criticised for as we have endeavoured to sort out this matter, is that we have taken down the Labor Party's maps, which Stephen Conroy, in a sort of SIM city-type of parallel universe had been covering with green blotches to suggest that the NBN was rolling out at a massive pace.                 We have been criticised for -                      We have been criticised for telling the truth about the progress of the NBN. Labor members have said, 'You've taken these green blotches off the map, and Senator Conroy has been so upset!' I mean, he is the shadow minister for Defence, but it seems that the only thing he is defending is himself as far as I can see.                 Of course, the remarkable thing in terms of reality denial in this area is that we have the member for Blaxland and the member for Greenway - surely the Laurel and Hardy of telecommunications - who have been there, constantly complaining about -                      They are supposed to be responsible for broadband policy. Well, we never hear from them - never get a question! Only Senator Conroy is to be heard.

  I know this is difficult for members opposite, but in a deregulated system fees can move up and fees can move down.                 What can be guaranteed in a deregulated system, in a market system, is that institutions will not try to price themselves out of the market. All I can assume is that the shadow minister opposite thinks that institutions are so stupid that they will destroy themselves. Well, they are not. They are not. We will give them the freedom that they need to be as good as they can be, and I do not know why members opposite are so frightened of freedom. Why are members opposite so frightened of freedom? Why do they think so ill and so little of our institutions that they want to keep them in chains?

  I thought it was okay, Madam Speaker! Thank you very much to the member for Herbert for his question. All of us on this side of the parliament, are determined - absolutely determined - to strengthen Medicare; to make sure that we remain the best friend that Medicare has ever had.                 I am sorry to say that when you look at those opposite, they are a shadow of their former selves. If you look back to the great Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, the last great Labor leader, he was a supporter of a co-payment because in his own words, he wanted to make sure that we could sustain Medicare going forward. At the moment in our country, for a population of 23 million people, we provide 263 million free services a year.                 We cannot give everything for free to everyone on the credit card, which is Labor's proposal. That is not sustainable. We cannot be spending $20 billion a year on Medicare as we do today; we were spending $8 billion a year 10 years ago, going out to $34 billion in 10 years' time. We have to strengthen and modernise Medicare because, if we do not, we will go down Labours path of destruction, and debt, and deficit and borrowing money to pay interest and to pay the health bill. It is unsustainable.                     I will make sure with the introduction of the co-payment that we will have the capacity that those people who can pay the seven-dollar co-payment will pay the seven dollars, but we will retain bulk-billing. We will retain bulk-billing, which is incredibly important. I believe very strongly, as the AMA says that they are in support of a co-payment in principle, that we will introduce a system that will have sustainability.                 It is true, as I look opposite and I see former union boss after former union boss, that these people are not anything on people like Brian Howe, Graham Richardson and Bob Hawke. These are pea hearts of the Australian Labor movement in the modern age. That is the reality. These people are not a patch on former Labor greats.                 Let me say this: we have outed the member for Fraser as a supporter of the co-payment, and he is a sensible person on this topic. Let's give him credit. Bob Hawke and Brian Howe supported a co-payment because they said without the co-payment Medicare was not sustainable. But I do know one thing: there is a sleeper opposite and we are about to out the sleeper - the supporter for a Medicare co-payment. We know the member for Fraser is a supporter. We know Bill Shorten will adopt every position that suits his position at that point in time. Who is the sleeper? Jenny Macklin, the member for Naga Naga. She is a supporter of a co-payment and I am going to spend more time on it soon.

  I just wish to make two points in response to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The first point is that anyone going to an Australian university to do an undergraduate degree will have the course fees, whatever the fees are, covered by FEE-HELP. So no-one need pay a single cent up-front -                      and I have to say it will be the most advantageous loan they ever receive under the conditions that this government has put forward. I simply reject this suggestion that there is something fundamentally wrong with a deregulated university system. I simply reject the idea being peddled by members opposite that our universities are not capable of governing themselves and that prospective students are not capable of making intelligent decisions about their future. And I am not alone in my support for a deregulated university system. Let me quote:                 Market based HECS -                  that is to say, market based fees -                  will also help to improve our higher education system by making universities even more responsive to student needs and educational outcomes _                 Well, who was this wise man? Who was this guru, this sage, this seer, this prophet? None other than Labor's Assistant Treasurer. I can understand why not too many of his colleagues want to sit next to him - I think at the moment he's got a bit of a communicable disease down there! Do you know what it is? It's common sense - only it's not very catching with members opposite!                     The result of the changes which this government is putting in place will be a better funded, more dynamic and competitive education sector. That is not me, that is Labor's Assistant Treasurer, and he is absolutely right. His common sense should be heeded by people like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

  I thank the member for his question and may I commend the member for Hinkler as a member who understands the importance of job creation in his electorate and understands the benefits that work for the dole can provide to young job seekers. I can advise the House that today I announced details of the government's arrangements for the first phase of our rollout of a revamped Work for the Dole program, which will offer to young job seekers aged 18 to 30 who have been unemployed for over 12 months the opportunity to participate in the Work for the Dole program. Phase 1 will be rolled out in some 18 selected areas around the country and will deliver to many young job seekers the types of experience which will assist them in getting a job and becoming more competitive in the job market.                 Work for the Dole also has the added benefit of delivering excellent outcomes in the community - delivering community projects that might not be possible if it was not for the labour resources that Work for the Dole can bring. Work for the Dole is a program that is supported right around the country. Let me quote the words of the former Mayor of Hervey Bay and now member for Hervey Bay, Ted Sorensen. Mr Sorensen said:                 When I was mayor of Hervey Bay, Work for the Dole participants helped build the footpaths and walkways along our picturesque Esplanade. It built self-confidence and gave participants a sense of achievement. Many of the participants gained long-term employment -                  Madam Speaker, gained long-term employment -                  as a direct result of their involvement in this program.                 Ted Sorensen understands the importance and the value of Work for the Dole. The Australian people understand the value of Work for the Dole. The coalition is committed. We are committed to creating opportunities for young people.                     That is why we have a range of programs including the job commitment bonus, relocation assistance and, for those people living in Tasmania, our Tasmanian jobs plan. But the most important thing we can do for young job seekers is to build a strong economy because nothing creates more jobs than a strong economy. It is a shame that the members opposite sit in the way; they just continue to sit there in the way of the budget measures that we wish to implement. Let me say: young Australians are right to be disappointed with the members of the opposition.                     On their watch, youth unemployment increased by 55,000. On their watch, the youth unemployment rate increased by almost 3 per cent. The coalition are focused on getting young people into work. The members opposite are just standing in the way.

  I should make a number of points in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question. First of all, we believe that the students and prospective students of Australia are more than capable of making decisions based on what is best for them and we also believe that universities of Australia are more than capable of making decisions on the basis of what is good for institutions and good for the students who attend those institutions. We do not believe that these people and these institutions are so inept, so self-centred and so incompetent that they cannot be trusted to look after their own futures. That is the first point I want to make.                 The second point I want to make is that every dollar of any fees will be covered by FEE-HELP loans, as you would expect. These are probably the most advantageous loans that anyone will ever receive. The other point I want to make is that the FEE-HELP system is for the first time being extended to a whole range of educational institutions, including institutions that are providing diploma and other courses. We are extending the range of help available to students; we are extending help to a much wider range of students. I should also point out that what is good for university students -                      should also be good for apprentices, and we are making loans available to apprentices on the same basis that we are making loans available to students.                 The final point I make is: fair enough, the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about debts incurred by students but at least those students would be coming into it with their eyes open. What about the debt -                      What about the debt that the former government settled every Australian with? What about that debt? What about the $667 billion of debt that was just going up and up and up?                     How can the Leader of the Opposition be crying crocodile tears over debts faced by students, which they will have every ability to repay in a stronger economy, and have no interest whatsoever in the debt that the government in which he served ran up and up and endlessly up? No wonder no-one takes this opposition leader seriously. Time expired

  I thank the member for Hume for his question and note his interest in responsible fiscal management.                     The coalition is delivering a responsible, affordable, sustainable aid budget. We have stabilised the budget at $5 billion so no longer do we have a situation where increases are announced and then the budget is raided, as Labor did. In the last 15 months of the Labor government it announced $5.7 billion in increases and then took them away from the aid budget.                 What we are doing is focusing on our region. We are not going to spread the aid budget so thinly that we are not delivering effective outcomes. We are reprioritising our aid budget. For example, we are increasing humanitarian programs by 28 per cent and we are increasing the emergency fund by 33 per cent. This is the fund that enables us to respond quickly to disasters like Typhoon Haiyan. This is the emergency fund that Labor raided to fill the hole in the border protection budget, making itself the third largest recipient of Australian aid. We are also increasing scholarships by 30 per cent.                 Contrast this responsible approach with that of Labor - irresponsible, unaffordable and unsustainable. Not content with its legacy of debt, running up to $667 billion, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says she is going to add $16 billion to the aid budget. Just where does she think she is going to get $16 billion from when they are already forcing us to borrow $1 billion a month? What fantasy world does she live in?                     We have had a revelation about Labor's deepest fantasies. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's mentor, the former Labor foreign minister, has revealed Labor's deepest fantasy.                      I quote from his travelogue.                     I quote from today's Australian Financial Review:'an indictment of the government I served in', says Bob Carr. 'It makes me toy with the opportunity I missed.' Bob Carr is the fiscally conservative Labor Prime Minister who might have maintained a dialogue with the Australian people about living within their means, not spending more than we have got.'                     So Bob Carr is fantasising. 'Bob Carr is a fiscally conservative Labor Prime Minister who might maintain a dialogue with the Australian people about living within our means, not spending more than we have got.                     Brave enough to wear the criticism of being a Liberal in Labor clothing.' That is what beats in the heart of every Labor member: having the courage to admit that we have got it right on reducing your debt. The Australian people elected us to pay off Labor's debt. You know that is right. You just do not have the courage to admit it.                   The member for Sydney then left the chamber.

  It is a pleasure to answer the member for Reid's question. I would be thrilled to explain how our Economic Action Strategy is supporting small business. The member for Reid shares the characteristic with so many on this side of the House. Small businesses and family enterprises run through our veins on this side of the House. As we have shaped that Economic Action Strategy to deal with the debt and deficit legacy, small business interests have been very much front of mind. And they had to be. Who could forget the 412,000 jobs lost in small business under Labor? They seemed to never miss an opportunity to hurt, harm and punish small business. We saw the small business share of private sector employment fall from 53 per cent to 43 per cent.                  So as we shape this Economic Action Strategy, re-energising small business, giving those courageous men and women who mortgage their house to create opportunities for themselves and others, a fair go is crucial. I will give you one example. No small business could possibly accept Labor's argument that racking up debt and deficit, paying interest payments on your VISA card, is some strategy for the future. No small business or family enterprise could do that. They hope to hand on their family enterprise to the next generation. Do you think they could hand it on saddled with debt that just keeps growing and that needs to be paid for by a VISA card? Small business people understand that and that is why change was required. That change not only gets the budget back on track; it creates the economic conditions in the business environment to get small business again being the engine room of our economy, giving us the jobs growth, the chance to turn around that job loss that Labor oversaw in its office.                  What have we offered? We have got tax cuts, the incentive of lower company tax, getting rid of the carbon tax that has been so punishing to the small business community and getting that infrastructure package going not only to shift commuters but to shift commerce to energise enterprise in our country. We have properly funded the ACCC. It seemed not to matter that small business needed the ACCC as consumers did. They ran that into the ground as well. We have unfair contract terms protections; improvements in government procurement; a chance to encourage people back into work, whether it is a mature aged person looking to be a part of a small business; and the PPL program. What a great set of initiatives.                 I know under the previous government no small business thought the previous Labor government was on their side, but I tell you what: with Labor's reaction to this plan to put our country back on track, they know the only friend small business and family enterprise have is the Abbott Liberal-National party government.

  The shadow minister opposite is unhappy about the changes to the funding of certain programs.                     I say to her: she is responsible. We had to save money because of the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite created. It is absolutely necessary -                      for the Commonwealth of Australia to live within its means. It is absolutely necessary for the Commonwealth of Australia to stop handing out money that it does not have and cannot sustainably borrow. It is absolutely necessary that we make responsible savings, including in this area. Because of the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite created some difficult decisions simply had to be made. We have not run away from the difficult decisions the way members opposite did consistently for six years.                 What we have said to the young people of Australia is: 'Don't waste your life. Leave school and either improve your education or get a job.' Now isn't that a salutary and necessary message to the young people of Australia? It really does say something about the sad decline of the once great Labor Party. It is not so much the working class party; I am afraid this is a political party which is more interested in expanding the welfare system than it is in expanding the wage system. This really is one of the reasons why no-one can take this Labor Party seriously.

  I thank the member for Murray for her question and for her very strong interest in improving the lot of young people in particular, but skills and apprenticeships in general, in the electorate of Murray and the 10,300 businesses that operate in that electorate. And based on the question from the member for Cunningham, and also a media report this morning, this is a question that needs to be answered.                 This government is committed to giving young people a better future in a job. That is what we are all about, that is what we are committed to. We are not whingeing Willies on this side; we are committed to making sure that young people get a chance. We are investing in apprenticeships and trainees. We have seen the Tools for Your Trade program, which just gave $5,500 willy-nilly to young apprentices, spent on all sorts of things - and, yes, we had reported to us by the apprenticeships centres that that money was being spent on tattoos. It was spent on a range of things, and that is not the way to teach people to be responsible with their money.                 The trade support loans will supply $20,000 over four years to an apprentice and then, once they earn over $51,000, they will repay the loan interest-free - absolutely interest-free. The loans will be indexed annually, but they are interest-free. This is the most generous of the young training support loans around, and I am proud that our government has handed it down.                 We saw this morning in the newspaper an erroneous report, and I feel sorry for the journalist who wrote that because he believed a line served up to him by the Greens that it would take people 50 years to repay the loan. That is simply rubbish! It highlights the financial illiteracy of those people in that party. The average time to repay a loan of this size, bearing in mind that 20 per cent of the loan gets written off once the apprentice finishes their course, is going to be around five to six years. This is there to support apprentices. On a simple calculation of interest not paid, which I have to do for the Greens because I know they cannot work it out, this system is worth more than twice as much as Tools for Your Trade and is a great thing for apprentices.                     No, I was not. And I was not referring to analysis that is overly complicated.                     No, I did not make it up! That is based on what it would take to repay a loan under normal arrangements. If they want to get some advice, I suggest they go and get some financial advice because they certainly need it after the debt they left us!

  It is the government's intention that there will be a GP co-payment from the middle of 2015. This is the government's intention. It is also the government's intention that we will put the legislation into the parliament and we expect that, after appropriate consideration, the parliament will understand that Labor's debt and deficit disaster has to be brought under control and that we need to make Medicare sustainable for the long term. That is what this co-payment is all about - it is about making Medicare sustainable for the long term.                     As members opposite in their hearts know, a modest co-payment is perfectly appropriate and sensible policy.                     It was members opposite in government under Bob Hawke that brought in a PBS co-payment. If it is perfectly right and proper to have a PBS co-payment, it is perfectly right and proper to have a modest Medicare co-payment. Let me just remind members opposite of what the then health minister and Deputy Prime Minister, Brian Howe, said back in 1991 when introducing a GP co-payment: 'The measures being introduced in this budget relate to the preliminary findings of the national health strategy. They are the first steps in dealing with the structural problems in the healthcare system.' He said this strategy outlined as a priority for reform, 'the judicious use of price signals to encourage both doctors and patients to be more selective in their use of medical services'. Who ran the national health strategy?                     So not only do we have Bob Hawke as the father of the co-payment, we have got the member for Jagajaga as the mother of the co-payment. The real authors of the co-payment are over there.                     Just to remind the member for Jagajaga, the 'judicious use of price signals to encourage both doctors and patients to be more selective in their use of medical services' was part of the national health strategy, which the member opposite helped to author.

  I do thank the member for Boothby for his question. The government's plan for a stronger Australia is quite simple. It was outlined again and again and again before the election and after the election. It is to stop the boats; it is to scrap the carbon tax; it is to build the roads of the 21st century; and it is to get the budget back under control. I can assure this parliament that this government is delivering. For almost six months there have been no successful people-smuggling ventures to our country, thanks to the fine work of the minister and also the professionalism of the naval, customs and police personnel on Operation Sovereign Borders.                 We are scrapping the carbon tax because that will make the average household $550 a year better off. We are cracking on with building the roads that Labor neglected. And this budget does tackle Labor's debt and deficit disaster. The budget had to tackle Labor's debt and deficit disaster because we just cannot go on borrowing $1 billion every month just to pay the interest on the borrowings. That is $1 billion in dead money. Without this $1 billion a month interest bill we could fund in just a month the north-south road which the member for Boothby is so naturally concerned about. We could fund the Midlands Highway duplication in just two weeks without the $1 billion a month interest bill. We could fund the Gateway Motorway upgrade in Brisbane with just one month of Labor's interest bill. We could fund the rebuild of the Bruce Highway in just seven months of Labor's interest bill.                 But we cannot spend more on schools, hospitals and roads because of Labor's interest bill. That $1 billion a month is the price that all Australians are paying for Labor's six years of incompetence and waste and debt and deficit disaster. I want to assure this parliament, and through this parliament the people of Australia, that this government will take the hard decisions necessary to put our country back on track. We will not squib them. That is what people elected us to do.

  I do not assume for a second that the shadow Treasurer has accurately characterised the comments of the Treasurer, but let me answer the question.                     The government has no plans whatsoever to collect student debts from dead people. What we do certainly intend to do is to make stronger efforts to collect student debts from living people, because that is what the taxpayers of this country have a right to expect.

  I thank the honourable member for Ryan for her question. I also welcome the interest of the Labor Party in paying back debt, because now they have a new-found interest in repaying debt - something they never had. But all of a sudden we discovered today that they are really concerned about people paying back their debts. The only problem is that the Australian Labor Party has made the debt worse for everyone. In just six years they wreaked havoc on the Australian economy and left us with a debt growing to $667 billion. That is $25,000 -                      I know - 'Come on!' I know it is hard to believe. I know that is a big number for you guys over there. There are a lot of zeros. But let's narrow it down to what it means for every single Australian. It is $25,000 of debt for every man, woman and child in Australia in 10 years, whether they went to university or not. So people who are the poorest of the poor in the nation have the same debt liability under Labor as the wealthiest person - and why? Because that is Labor's approach to debt. They pick and choose the moments they want to talk about it.                 The great challenge is that without action in our budget the interest on that debt would be $3 billion a month, and 70 per cent of that interest is paid to people overseas. Because we are borrowing money from people overseas, we have to pay interest back to those people, and 70 per cent of the interest bill is paid to people living overseas. The Labor Party want to make this issue worse. They do not want to improve the debt problem; they actually want to make it worse. That is why they are opposing $40 billion of savings, including $5 billion of their own savings, which is quite remarkable.                 But, what is more, it is even worse than that. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out, the member for Sydney wants to increase it by a further $16 billion. She wants to go back to the full foreign aid program that Labor had - $16 billion extra in foreign aid with borrowed money. Of course, the Labor Party will not deny it.                     Are you denying it? No, they are not denying it. You are committed to it - an extra $16 billion. In fact, she put out a press release.                     $16 billion on top of $40 billion. The pain of Labor just keeps going on and on and on, and every Australian is going to have to pay back that debt.

  I am happy to deal with these matters, as you would expect, Madam Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition is speculating on debt. Let me give him this fact. Under Labor's policy a family of four would face a $100,000 share in Labor's debt bill of $667 billion. Look at the budget figures. Under Labor's policy our gross debt would have maxed out in 10 years time at $667 billion - $25,000 per Australian man, woman and child.                     That is the debt that this government was elected to address and that is what we are doing. We are addressing Labor's debt and deficit disaster. We are responding to Labor's interest bill. We are letting this country know how we will respond to Labor's debt and deficit disaster, how we will clean up Labor's mess. The challenge is for 'Interest Bill', sitting over there, to tell us how he would deal with Labor's interest bill.

  I thank Professor Palmer for his question. I do on the note that, as he would know -                      No, just listen. As he would know, Australia is a net importer of capital. As Professor Palmer would know, we have essentially been a net importer of capital since 1788 because we have a very large country that relies on a lot of foreign investment -                      such as from China from CIDIC. We rely on foreign investment to develop the mines. We rely on foreign loans in order to build and construct our activity. Every year we import around $40 billion in net terms from the rest of the world to fund our growth.                     No, no. This is an education for you as well, so just listen.                     So as a nation on an annual basis Australia does not fund itself like other nations, like Japan, which has an enormous pool of domestic savings, the UK or even Italy, which have much higher government debt - yes, they do - but have a very large pool of domestic savings that funds the needs of the government. Whereas in Australia we do not fund ourselves on an annual basis, so when we borrow money, be it from our banks, or when the federal government runs deficits and it borrows money from the rest of the world to help to fund its everyday living costs, then that increases our exposure to international capital market volatility and it increases the exposure of Australia to movements around the rest of the world that some other countries do not have to do.                  So our lower level of debt does not necessarily excuse us at all from some of the challenges in global financial markets because we import money to build the mines, to build the ports and to build the railways, because we import money every year. The reason we want to get back to surplus is so we can start lending money to Australians instead of borrowing money from people overseas to fund our needs. We want to become a self-sufficient nation. We want to ensure that we fund our demands. We want to ensure that we live within our means. We want to make sure that as a nation we can stand proudly and independently on our own two feet, that we are not relying on anyone in the international market to fund our needs and fund our future. The coalition government stand for the independence and the resilience of Australia, and we will not apologise for that.

  I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. As one of the champions of Western Sydney, she knows that Western Sydney will play a vital role in the economic growth of our country in the years ahead. It is already, with two million people, Australia's fourth largest city. It is an area that will continue to grow. One in two people living in Sydney will be living in Western Sydney before too much longer. That is why that region needs a major capital investment, a major commitment to building better infrastructure. It is a call that has been crying out for some time and which the previous government left unanswered.                 But this government, the government that is going to build the infrastructure of the 21st century, has answered the call. There is a commitment for $3.5 billion worth of new road and infrastructure activities in that area. This will transform Western Sydney: upgrading its existing roads, building new motorways and building the kind of infrastructure that a city of two million people has a right to expect and, in particular, also building for them an airport. What cities around the world of two million people do not have an airport of their own? A key part of this major investment will be the new Badgerys Creek airport -                      which will provide an opportunity for those who want to live and work in Western Sydney to connect to the rest of the world.                 Our road program includes upgrading the Northern Road and the construction of a new four-lane motorway between the M7 and Northern Road and building the Bringelly Road up to a four-lane standard from the Camden Valley Way to Northern Road. And there will be a $200 million package for local roads in Western Sydney to help provide the infrastructure to service that rapidly growing part of the country.                 I am pleased to report also to the House that work on these projects is proceeding at speed. The project office will be opening very shortly. We will be calling tenders next month for the work on the Bringelly Road as the first project, a $500 million project, to start improving the infrastructure that Western Sydney needs for the future. We have a commitment, a $3.5 billion commitment with the New South Wales government, to Western Sydney to build the infrastructure that it needs to give Western Sydney the opportunity it wants to contribute to our nation and to help build a stronger local economy.

  The government has, as the member suggests, changed indexation rates at various times from male total average weekly earnings to the consumer price index. We have done it because we want pensions and other benefits to be sustainable for the long term. I do not necessarily accept the analysis that the member cites, and obviously we will be looking at that piece of analysis and we will be coming up with a response at the right time.                 There is nothing wrong with changing the indexation from male total average weekly earnings to the consumer price index. And why do I know there is nothing wrong with changing the indexation from MTAWE to CPI? Because Labor did it. Labor did it in the budget couple of years ago. In budget measures 2009-10, they changed the family tax benefit family payment indexation from MTAWE to CPI. That is what they did. So not only is the member for Jagajaga the mother of the Medicare co-payment, she is the mother of CPI indexation.                     Madam Speaker, I am not going to mislead; I am going to quote what the member for Jagajaga said at the time in 2009. She said, 'These reforms' - that is, changing indexation to CPI - 'are designed to ensure the current system is sustainable and provides continuing support for families who need it most and encourage participation and productivity'.                     She was honest then. She was telling the truth, and now I think she is just having -                      Well I just think she is playing politics now.

  I thank the member for Casey for his question. The problem in the 1990s with Medicare, as Prime Minister Hawke pointed out, was that it was unsustainable without a co-payment, and that is why Labor supported a co-payment when it came to our medicine scheme. We have a co-payment there to make our medicine system sustainable and we are arguing, as Bob Hawke did then, that we need a co-payment to make our system sustainable going forward. I want to get a better understanding of why there was common sense in the Labor Party then, but there is not now except of course for the member for Fraser, who is supportive of a co-payment as well, but I will come back to him in a second.                     Why would the Labor Party be so sound in their policy thinking, why would they want to support a sustainable Medicare system in the 1990s but in 2014 the Leader of the Opposition is opportunistic and does not want to support a sustainable Medicare? Obviously it is because of the people that were around at the time. I looked to the then Minister for Health, Brian Howe. He had to say this in 1991 when the Labor Party believed in something and they produced a co-payment to keep any care sustainable. He said:                 It was to enact a number of changes designed to ensure that Medicare remains a sustainable, equitable and efficient universal health insurance system.                 They were wise words from the then Labor health minister. But where would he have got his advice? I had a look at some of the comments that he had to make and he said at the time:                 The measures being introduced in this budget related to the preliminary findings of the National Health Strategy.                 The 'National Health Strategy'? I thought: who put that piece of work together? Who put those wise words together? If you have a look at the member for Jagajaga's website, she is happy to skite that:                 Prior to entering parliament, Jenny was the director of two major strategic reviews reporting to Brian Howe, including the National Health Strategy.                 I thought: let me seek further confirmation.                   The                    member for Ballarat                    then left the chamber.                     All I ask is that Jenny Macklin, as she then was, who is described as the director of this particular body that advised Brian Howe. It says, 'For further information about the advice _' - to the then government - 'in relation to the co-payment, contact Jenny Macklin, the director of the National Health Strategy.' All I ask is that common sense prevails in the modern Labor Party. If Jenny Macklin was the mother of the co-payment and Bob Hawke was the father of the co-payment then the political love child of the co-payment should stand up and in this place again commend the co-payment so that we can make Medicare sustainable into the future.

  Pensions are going up every six months. They are going up every six months now, they will go up every six months in the future. They are going up. I just think it would be much better for our country, it would be much better for the pensioners of Australia, if the alternative government of our country stopped scaring pensioners and started to tell pensioners the truth. And the truth is that pensions will go up every six months -                      The difference, as the member the member for Jagajaga well knows, is that indexation changes -                      The difference, as the member for Jagajaga well knows, is that indexation changes from male total average weekly earnings or CPI, whichever is the greatest, to CPI. That is the difference.                     As the member for Jagajaga well knows, what this government is doing is applying to pensions the same indexation that she applied to family tax benefits. Let me tell her very softly, because I do not want to be accused of shouting at anyone, that we are doing for pensions exactly what she did for the family tax benefit. It is exactly the same thing.                     I ask the member for Jagajaga: if it was fair for her to do this to the family tax benefit -                      how can it be unfair for us to do it for pensioners? How can it be fair for her to do it and somehow be unfair for us to do it?                     The Prime Minister has the call and will answer the question as it has been put to him. I have been asked a question about the indexation of pensions and I am just pointing out that the indexation system that this government is applying to pensions is exactly the same as the indexation system that the member for Jagajaga applied to the family tax benefit - exactly the same.                 The member for Jagajaga cannot help herself. What she does not like is the fact that she has been caught out in utter hypocrisy. What members opposite cannot stand is the fact that this government has been honest and true. Members opposite are utterly, completely hypocritical. Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor.

  I am very pleased to answer a question from the member for Bennelong about the support that the government is giving to school students in the budget, because the truth is that we are keeping all of our election commitments in this budget to school students. Funding to school students goes up every year of the next four years in the forward estimates, peaking at $18.1 billion in 2017, which is a 3.1 per cent real increase in spending on schools. In fact, it is $100 million more than would have been the case if Labor had been re-elected, because of the $1.2 billion cut that Australia's No. 1 whinger visited on Australian school students when he was the Minister for Education. Because we are also funding school chaplains to the tune of $246 million, we are doing more for schools than Labor would if they had been re-elected.                  The member for Bennelong asked me if there were any alternative approaches. I can say to the member for Bennelong that the Leader of the Opposition - Australia's No. 1 whinger - said in Perth, on 31 March, in answer to a question from a journalist on radio -                      The journalist asked the Leader of the Opposition:                  You have committed and you still will commit to the next election for those years five and six?                 These were the so-called Gonski spending measures.                  On 31 March the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Yes.' He said:                 We budgeted for this when we were in Government and furthermore, what does it cost Australia if we short change our kids?                 That commitment did not seem to last very long did it, Leader of the Opposition - did it, Interest Bill? The Leader of the Opposition said, in an answer to a similar question at Moonee Ponds on 22 May:                 We will reveal all our policies in good time before the next election _                 And on 18 May, the shadow Treasurer said:                 In terms of what we would do in office, well, we would look at the proposals, we would look at the state of funding of schools and hospitals that we inherit.                 The hapless shadow minister, the member for Adelaide, in 158 words to the Christian schools conference on Monday just this week, the word 'yes' did not appear once in the answer.                      In fact, the parents of Australia, I always suspected were being conned by the previous government in terms of their so-called blue-sky promises that they made before the election. The Leader of the Opposition committed, on 31 March, to billions and billions of dollars of new spending. Only his shadow Treasurer, his shadow minister and himself have all pulled back on the leash -                      because they know that the economic credibility will be shredded.                     They are offering not only $16 billion in foreign aid spending but $7 billion in school spending and tens of billions of dollars in health spending. They have to choose, and the choice they have made is to be dishonest with the Australian people.

  This really is pretty low from the Leader of the Opposition. It really is pretty low for the Leader of the Opposition to come into this parliament and ask this kind of question. The decisions in respect of the official residences are all made on the basis of departmental advice. One of the very first things that I did on winning the election was to say to the departmental officials that I was not going to occupy the mansion that they had rented. Of all the various charges that could be levelled against this government, this is absolutely the least sustainable.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He was elected to this place at the last election because his now constituents know a mess when they see one, and they saw one under the previous government on our borders; and it is our task to clean up that mess. We have been doing that in a consistent fashion and we have been communicating that in a consistent fashion. In fact, it is now 161 days since the last successful people-smuggling venture, and I have heard that some members opposite have been concerned about the monotonous way in which I have been reminding the House about these results. I can report that it does seem to be having an impact with those opposite. In a blinding statement of the obvious yesterday, the shadow minister for immigration said to Ben Fordham on Radio 2GB what he has finally accepted: 'I accept that there hasn't been a venture that has come here since December. And I accept that they are turning back boats.' There he goes. He has not connected the two in any way, shape or form. Later tonight he may well confess and admit that tomorrow is Friday. He could come to that conclusion but he is not going to make any link to the fact that today is Thursday, because those on that side do not understand cause and effect. They do not understand that you cannot spend and spend and spend and not rack up deficit after deficit after deficit and create debts. They have no understanding of the link between spending and deficits. They have no understanding that if you want to stop boats, you have to stop boats. You actually have to turn back boats where it is safe to do so, and they are in complete denial about the cause and effect and about the success of the policies of this government.                 Yesterday the shadow minister could not bring himself to acknowledge the success of our turn-back policy. He could not do it. If he cannot acknowledge the success now, if six months of the success of this policy is not enough to convince him, it never will be. That is why they on the other side will never follow through with the policies that have been successful under this government. They will turn back on turn-backs, they will roll over on offshore processing, they will honour the promise of people smugglers, and they will return to the policy of providing permanent visas when it comes to those who have come illegally by boat. I have got some advice for him. If he wants to know how to go forward, don't look to the left down there where the Greens are; don't look to the right over here, where you have two failed immigration ministers. Look this way. Look on this side of the House where successful policies are saving lives and stopping the boats.

  Pensions in Mallee, and everywhere else, are going up under this government. There are 36,208 households in Mallee. Let me repeat that. There are 36,208 households in the seat of Mallee that the member who asked the question is so concerned about. Every one of those households could be, on average, $550 a year better off if the member for Bendigo would do the right thing by those 36,208 households. Indeed, there are probably 36,617 households in her own seat of Bendigo. Come on, Member for Bendigo, help those 36,617 households. Take the carbon tax burden off their backs and do it now.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. We know that had the Labor Party continued in office with their NBN plan, it would have cost $73 billion - an enormous cost to the taxpayer - and it had the consequence of raising internet prices by up to 80 per cent. Every aspect of the Labor Party's financial management involved a denial of reality and a refusal to acknowledge the need to maintain sustainable finances. The honourable member asked what we are doing. We are completing the project three and a half years sooner and $32 billion cheaper - and therefore more affordably.                 The previous approach by the Labor Party is very, very well illustrated by a recent press release put out by the member for Blaxland and the member for Greenway. It is a very modest release. The titles of the two members take up more than half the page. They are in about 20-point type - no doubt out of deference to those with poor eyesight. But what is remarkable here is the denial of any type of financial responsibility. They say here that under Labor's approach only $30 billion would be paid for by the government - only $30 billion. So where would the $43 billion come from? Where would it come from - junk bonds? Who knows? They suggest that it could be borrowed by the NBN Co with no government guarantee - that you could borrow $43 billion on $2.6 billion of free cash flow. It would not even be enough to pay the interest.                 As I read this I became angrier and angrier at the incredible profligacy of the Labor Party. But then I was filled with a warm glow. This press release made me feel young again. It reminded me of shoulder pads, Duran Duran and Bruce Springsteen. It went back to the eighties! This, Madam Speaker, is the financial gospel of Alan Bond and Laurie Connell. Oh, Madam Speaker, remember those halcyon days of the America's Cup, margaritas at Fremantle - it was all coming back - and when you could borrow tens and tens of billions of dollars and never have to pay it back; when it was all fantasy money. Oh, Madam Speaker, this is a retro party indeed. They are going back into the past. Sadly, I compared them to Laurel and Hardy a day or so ago. That was unfair, because at least Stan Laurel fessed up with his famous line, 'What another fine mess I got you into.'

  As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition well knows, it has been the consistent policy of this coalition to have a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme -                      because we believe that paid parental leave is a workplace entitlement not a welfare one. I should point out that the parent earning some $55,000 would be much, much better off under the coalition's paid parental leave scheme than under that put in place by the former government.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. In the recent budget the government confirmed that Australia would spend more than $5 billion on development assistance in the year 2014-15. Australia will continue to be ranked in the top 10 group of major donors in the OECD world and 92 per cent of Australian aid will now be spent in our region - an increase over previous years.                 I want to contrast the approach that we have taken - the affordable, responsible, sustainable approach - to aid with that of the former government. Former Labor foreign minister, Bob Carr, has shed light on Labor's handling of not only the economy but also the aid budget. Behind closed doors, Labor admits what it refuses to tell the Australian people. I quote from Bob Carr's travel log. He said: 'Wayne Swan told me the fiscal situation is ruinous.' That is the only truth that Wayne Swan ever told when he was in government. He certainly got that right: the debt and deficit legacy under Labor would have been ruinous had they stayed in office. According to Bob Carr, the former Treasurer had no option but to announce increases in the aid budget - not because of any concerns about poverty but because of factional fights within Labor. I quote again from the shadow minister's mentor, Bob Carr, who said about increases to the aid budget that Swan 'would have risked a Ruddite revolt otherwise'. So, no sooner had the shadow minister for foreign affairs shift her support from Julia Gillard to Kevin Rudd, that he cut a further $878 million from the aid budget - taking Labor's total budget cuts in the aid budget to $5.7 billion over the last 15 months. Having the left the country with record levels of debt, of some $667 billion -                      I am prepared to share this document to which I am referring. The opposition deputy leader has now committed Labor to finding an additional $16 billion. Here it is; here is her press release of 14 May. They have to find an additional $16 billion for the aid budget.                 The member for Sydney owes it to the Australian people to reveal what areas of the budget Labor will cut to find this $16 billion additional funding for the aid budget. Coincidentally, $16 billion is what the government spends on higher education. So I call on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to rule out cuts of $16 billion to higher education. What about ruling out $16 billion -                      Where else are you going to find the money? What fantasy world do you live in? You had better let your friends in the Socialist Alternative know of this plan - because they will have something to protest about then. Affordable, responsible, sustainable - that is the mantra of the coalition.

  The Leader of the Opposition should tell the truth to the Australian people -                      and the truth is that pensions will go up every six months.                     Pensions will go up every six months. The only difference is that, from 2017, pensions will go up by the same indexation method that the shadow minister for social services applied to family tax benefit. That is the truth, and the Leader of the Opposition should stop scaring the pensioners of Australia.                 As for this Paid Parental Leave scheme, which the Leader of the Opposition is a little obsessed with - and I do not know why he is so frightened of letting the women in the workplaces of Australia get a fair deal at last. I mean, why are the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition so against the women in the workplaces of Australia getting a fair deal at last?                     That is right. When the public servants who used to work with her as a minister took paid parental leave, they got their paid parental leave at full pay. What was wrong with that for them? If they got paid at their full pay, why shouldn't the women working for supermarkets and factories and small businesses right around our country? Why shouldn't they get the same deal that has long been given to the public servants of Australia?                     Let us scotch this myth that somehow paid parental leave is going to benefit wealthy women. Ninety-eight per cent of the women in the workforce of this country earn less than $100,000, and they deserve a fair go, and they will get a fair go under this government.

  Fortunately I do still support Queensland, and it was a bad night.                 I thank the honourable member for his question. As a gastroenterologist, he is probably in the right place to deal with any blockages that we might have over there in the Senate. It is very important that we understand that, just with the money that it is costing us in interest a month, I know they are expanding the Bruce Highway in your electorate, and that is about a billion dollars - we could do that every month with the interest. I know you have got Bucketts Way over in your area as well. We could do that 57 times a month with the money we are spending on interest.                  If we had $10 notes, on the interest, we could lie those $10 notes end to end. We could start in Melbourne, go through your electorate in Lyne and all the way to Cairns. You know what would happen when we got to Cairns? We could turn around and keep lying the $10 notes down and go all the way back to Melbourne. Do you know what would happen when we got to Melbourne? We could turn around and go back up to Cairns. And do you know what happens when we get to Cairns? We turn around and go back to Lyne. But they say there is not a problem!                     The issue is, of course, that they believe it is not a problem. Even though we could go from Melbourne, through to your electorate, up the Pacific Highway, up the Bruce Highway, back and forth, they say it is not a problem. So I do not know what is a problem. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse turning up for dinner - maybe that is a problem. Who would know? Vikings on your pond - maybe that is a problem.                  What we do know is that Pascal Lamy, who is a socialist, said quite clearly the other day that what we have to do, because we are a commodity based economy, is move commodities. If we do not move commodities we have got a real problem. That is why Pascal Lamy says our debt problem is vastly different to the debt problem of Japan or Germany - because we are basically relying on commodities. So, in relying on commodities, it is agriculture that is really putting its shoulder to the wheel, and I am happy to inform the House that we have moved over 585,000 head of cattle in the last week and in excess of 1.3 million sheep in the live trade. About three weeks ago, we loaded 4,000 litres of milk -                      you should be interested in this - and we sent it to Shanghai. We are getting paid between $7 and $9 a litre, and it was only costing us about $1.26 to move it there. That is a good way to make a dollar. That is agriculture. We have also moved in excess of four million tonnes of barley. We have moved more than 671 tonnes of veal and beef. All of these things -

 Five hundred and nineteen thousand: that is the number of jobs, in the latest figures, lost under the Labor government from the small business community of Australia - 519,000. Now, that might not interest those opposite. They might not be union jobs, they might not be important to the opposition leader's job, but they are crucial to the livelihoods of so many Australians. Five hundred and nineteen thousand livelihoods have been lost from what is the engine room of our economy because of the indifference, the neglect and the harsh measures introduced by Labor when in government. When we are faced with having to deal with the consequences of six horrendous years of Labor, all we get is complaint and obstruction. We need to fix the budget, a task that now nobody contests. Even the former Treasurer recognises the need. The Parliamentary Budget Office said this week it is time to start this repair job, saying:                 _ otherwise the longer you leave it the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind it back _                 What we have seen in this parliament all of this week is example after example of how the Abbott government's economic recovery strategy, our plan to repair the budget and get our finances on track, will make a material difference to the lives of Australians and the opportunities for the future, and all we run into is obstruction from those opposite. We heard the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It said:                 The budget goes a long way to restoring all important business confidence that will drive investment and job creation, particularly for Australia's two million small businesses _                 Now, if we are to start the task of restoring that jobs vitality in small businesses and family enterprises, we have to get the economic conditions right. To get those economic conditions right, we have to stop the runaway debt and deficit that we have inherited from the former government. We have to implement our economic action strategy, those many measures that are there to support small business to recruit and retain -                      I hear those opposite mocking the Paid Parental Leave scheme, a scheme they are happy to have for the public servants and they are happy to have for the big end of town. What is wrong with offering those same benefits to small and medium-sized enterprises? What is wrong with that? Is that your strategy - to gut small businesses of their capacity to employ, to show no interest in those 519,000 jobs lost from small business under Labor and then to deny them the many measures in this budget to support innovation, growth, the chance to recruit and retain staff, to get involved in exporting, to use technology, to grow prospects and to improve jobs and economic vitality for the future? Why are you against this, Labor? We have Captain Complaint talking out of both sides of his mouth on these budget measures. As you go home to your electorates, think about how many of those 519,000 jobs were in your community. We are trying to get them back.

 There are no changes to pensions in this term of parliament. All savings in health are being reinvested in health, and overall health spending increases. I am happy to say that, yes, the top marginal rate of tax goes up by 2c in the dollar for three years, and that will impact on people earning over $180,000 a year, which is less than three per cent of all taxpayers. And indexation -                      Yes, we have fuel excise indexation; and, yes, in the first year that will cost the average family between 40c and 60c a week.                 The truth is that all of us have to contribute to the budget repair job. We all have to contribute to the budget repair job. The sad truth is that every single Australian is paying the price for Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Every single Australian is paying the price for Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Labor's interest bill is $1 billion every single month. This is the sad price that every single Australian is having to pay to repair six years of incompetence, debt and deficit deceit. That is the price.                 Do I regret this? Of course I regret it. We are all having to pay the price of Labor's incompetence. Of course I regret it, but I make no apologies ever - ever - for doing what is necessary for this country. I make no apologies whatsoever for doing what is necessary for this country. The people of Australia elected us to fix the mess that Labor left, and fix it we will.                 I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  The Leader of the Opposition should not verbal the Minister for Communications, who said no such thing. He said no such thing. The truth is that there is no easy way to sort out the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite left us. There is no easy way, but this government has explained to the Australian people how we will fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. This is a good budget, an honest budget and it is the right budget for this time. Now that this government has explained how we would deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster, the Leader of the Opposition should explain how he will deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster.

  I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and I wish to assure her that this government is taking important steps to strengthen our economy. We are faithfully implementing our election commitments. Stopping the boats will save some $2.5 billion over the next four years. Scrapping the carbon tax will save the average household $550 a year. Building the Roads of the 21st Century will be a massive boost to productivity, because people will not be stuck in traffic jams. We are tackling Labor's legacy of $1 billion a month in dead money - just to pay the interest on Labor's borrowings. We are getting the budget back under control. That means that health and education programs, pensions and other social security payments will be sustainable in the long term.                  This is a budget for saving, but it is also a budget for building with the largest infrastructure spend in the history of the Commonwealth. There is the East West Link in Melbourne, the WestConnex and NorthConnex in Sydney. There is the North-South Road in Adelaide; there is the Gateway upgrade to the Bruce Highway in Queensland. I know the member for Gilmore will also appreciate this: we are restoring Defence spending.                  It is a budget for living within our means, but it is also a budget for playing to our strengths. The Medical Research Future Fund will, over time, double Australia's medical research spend, and this is an important area of comparative advantage for our country. Some eight Australian Nobel Prize winners, such as Howard Florey the inventor of penicillin, have been medical researchers. Four Australians of the Year in the last decade, such as Professor Ian Frazer the inventor of cervical cancer vaccine, have been medical researchers. These investments will give us the treatments and the cures of the future - the treatments and the cures that our people and people right around the world need.                 What we are doing is investing less in short-term consumption so that we can put more into long-term investment. That is the overall philosophy behind this government's budget. We are getting on with the job that the people of Australia elected us to do - not to make the easy decisions, but the necessary decisions for our country's future.

  Again, Madam Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition should not promote falsehoods in this House. We promised that the DFRDB and the DFRB pensions would be indexed by CPI or male total average weekly earnings, whichever is the greater.                     We have absolutely delivered on the policy commitments we took to the election.

  I thank the member for Barton for his question. He will be watching with great interest and enthusiasm as he sees the benefits of the coalition government's $50 billion infrastructure expenditure rollout in his own electorate through projects like WestConnex, an $11 billion project and perhaps the biggest infrastructure project that our country has seen.                 I have noticed that members opposite are not so enthusiastic about this roads program. Some members opposite have claimed that we are not really providing much more money than Labor had intended to spend or, in the case of the member for Grayndler, there are only two extra projects that we are funding above what Labor had intended. The reality is that the member for Grayndler got that wrong as well. The reality is that we have a $16 billion commitment above what Labor had committed to roads and infrastructure prior to coming to office. The reality is that we are getting on with the job of a substantially boosted road infrastructure program that will make a real difference for Australia. So, on top of the two projects that the member for Grayndler was referring to, let me mention the East West Link, a $3 billion commitment in Melbourne; Adelaide's north-south corridor, an extra $394 million; the Perth freight link, $866 million; the Northern Territory roads project, $77 million; the Toowoomba range crossing; and the WestConnex project. Of course, he completely forgot the whole of the $2.9 billion commitment to Western Sydney - all forgotten - along with the Roads to Recovery program investment, which Labor is voting against in the House of Representatives, the national highway upgrade program for $229 million and $300 million for the new bridges program.                 When you look at what Labor actually promised to do, the reality is that there were often so many conditions attached that they knew it would not happen. Yes, they were prepared to fund the Gateway Motorway in Brisbane, but only if it was tolled; they would fund the WestConnex, but only if it was not tolled; they would fund South Road in Adelaide, but only one end; and they would never go near the Toowoomba range. What about the Pacific Highway? Yes, they would do something there but only if New South Wales paid half, something they never asked when Labor was the state government in New South Wales. The Bruce Highway? Again, only if Queensland paid half, and even then there are 27 projects that we are funding on the Bruce Highway that Labor would not go near. This government is getting on with the business of building the infrastructure of the 21st century; Labor only talks.

  Again I would say to the member opposite that we made a commitment that DFRDB and DFRB pensions would be indexed by the higher rate, a commitment which the former government made in opposition but failed to deliver on in government. We made that commitment in opposition and we have delivered on it in government.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. As a new member, he knows how important it is to address the legacy of debt and deficit that has been left behind by the previous Labor government. If we do not take action now the debt that will be apportioned to every man, woman and child in Australia within 10 years will be $25,000 - in total, $667 billion. The interest bill on that debt will be nearly $3 billion a month, and 70 per cent of the money that we pay in interest goes to people living overseas, because they have lent us the money to pay for Labor's programs, particularly over the last six years.                 At the moment of course we are paying $1 billion in interest, and 70 per cent of that, over $700 million each month, goes overseas to pay people the interest on the debt. When confronted with that, Labor says, 'Don't worry, if we were re-elected we would have got the budget back to surplus.' The fact is that that is plainly untrue. That is not just our observation in the budget papers; the secretary of the Treasury identified that that was plainly untrue. When we tried to peel back exactly how they managed to make this claim, we saw that Labor used an assumption that they would reduce government expenditure to two per cent growth in real terms. That is a magical number, because they left 3.7 per cent growth. They said, 'Don't worry, we would have got to two per cent.' After we have done what we have done in this budget, after all the argument about co-payments and the pensions, after all the arguments about cuts in health and education, we have only got that expenditure down to 2.7 per cent. We have brought it down from Labor's 3.7 to 2.7 per cent growth, but Labor said they would get it to two per cent growth. How did they do with it? What a magic pudding it is!                     Labor were miraculously going to go further and harder than the coalition in cuts to the budget in order to bring it back to surplus.                 So let us get it right: Labor is not just opposing $40 billion of savings that we have in our budget - which gets it from 3.7 per cent to 2.7 per cent - but Labor is opposing $20 billion before the budget, including $5 billion that they took to the last election. So, they are not only opposing everything we are doing and everything that they promised at the last election but they would need to find tens of billions of dollars to meet their target. It just shows you that they are complete hypocrites.

  Like the member who asked me the question, I want to protect the environment. But unlike the member who asked me the question, I do not want to destroy the economy in the process. Even the Labor Party finally worked out that any environmental policy that closed down the coal industry was a policy that no sensible Australian government could follow.                 I am all in favour of protecting our environment but I will tell you what else I am in favour of: I am also in favour of economic growth - not just in this country but right around the world. If we are going to have economic growth - not just in this country but right around the world - it will require energy. It will require energy, and by far the most efficient and effective source of baseload energy is coal.                  It is interesting that members of the Labor Party are now cheering-on their Green coalition partner. Let the coal workers of Australia know that Labor members of this parliament, by the interjections, are agreeing with that Green up there. They want to close the coal industry down. We want the coal industry to be an important part of Australia's economic future, and the world's, for the benefit of us and for the benefit of people everywhere.

  I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for her question.                      I really do hope those opposite listen carefully to the answer, because it is hugely important to be consistent and predictable in relation to public policy. That is why, as the Prime Minister said before, we went to the last election promising veterans that we would lift the indexation arrangements in relation to particular payments.                     And we have delivered. Unlike Labor, which went to a previous election promising to lift indexation and, when it got into government, walked away - they were inconsistent - we are consistent. In the budget we said that we are going to have a Medicare co-payment to make it sustainable. The Labor Party, once upon a time, believed in Medicare co-payments. In fact, in the 1991 budget speech the government said:                 The Government is therefore reforming Medicare to change benefit arrangements to slow the growth in the use of medical services and to assist the medical profession to lift the quality of care available from General Practitioners.                 So the Labor Party, once upon a time, believed in co-payments in Medicare; now they do not. How does that sit with them previously saying that they believed in co-payments for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? In fact, they invented the co-payment for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in 1990.                 And when they were last in government the Labor Party were imposing a co-payment fee on pensioners, of $6 per script for the first 60 scripts - $360. Now, they are so outraged about a co-payment for pensioners that they are opposing, for pensioners, a $70 co-payment over 10 visits to the doctor. So what is the consistency there? There is no consistency.                 But wait: there is more. In 2009, the Labor Party froze indexation of the upper-income thresholds of family tax benefits A and B and the baby bonus for three years. So in government they wanted to freeze family payments. Now they are in opposition they want to oppose a freeze on family payments. In the 2011 budget, the Labor Party again froze indexation of supplements for three years; now they want to oppose the freezing of supplements. The Labor Party, in government, introduced indexation of fuel excise; now they want to oppose the indexation of fuel excise.                  The Labor Party, in government, introduced fees for universities. Now they are opposed to changes in universities. I well remember. It was the Labor Party, of course, that increased the pension age to 67. Now the Labor Party want to oppose it going to 70. You see, it is their hypocrisy, because the Labor Party has no core principles. There is no light on the hill.

  We made a specific commitment to people on DFRDB and DFRB pensions and we have honoured that specific commitment - we have absolutely honoured that specific commitment. I make the point that I made in answer to the earlier question from the member for Lingiari: no military pensioner will receive an inferior rate of indexation to a civilian one. Unlike members opposite who make commitments to veterans in opposition which they break in government, we make commitments to veterans in opposition and we have absolutely honoured them in government.

  I thank the member for Forrest for her question. I think she would agree, as would most Australians, that there is both a private and a public benefit to higher education qualifications in this country. Most obviously, the public benefit is manifested in a more productive workforce and a growing and productive economy. But there is also a very obvious private benefit. There has been much research done that shows that people who have been to university live longer; they are healthier; they enjoy a 3.3 per cent unemployment rate as opposed to a 7.8 per cent unemployment rate for those people who leave school at year 12 and do not get a qualification; and they will earn $1 million more over a lifetime, or 75 per cent more, than those Australians without a qualification.                  Sixty per cent of taxpayers do not have a higher education qualification and yet they are paying 60 per cent of the cost of tuition fees of students who are at university. So 60 per cent of Australians do not go to university and yet out of the goodness of their own hearts they pay 60 per cent of the tuition fees of students who go to university. Those students will go on to earn 75 per cent more than Australians who do not go to university. So our reforms rebalance the approach, the contribution, between students and taxpayers to around fifty-fifty. Students can borrow every single dollar of that up-front and we are asking them in these reforms to pay back at an interest rate which is the same as the taxpayer has been good enough to pay on their behalf in borrowing the money.                 I am not alone in recognising the private benefit that comes from higher education. In a book that was released a couple of years ago one writer in this House said:                 I clearly remember being among a distinct minority of university students who supported paying for our degrees through HECS. I supported it because I could see the inherent logic. Our incomes would be higher because we had been to university.                 Some members might think I am talking about the member for Fraser and they would be incorrect. In fact, I was not; I am talking about the shadow Treasurer, the member for McMahon. He recognises the private benefit in university education. But let us not leave Dr Leigh out, because he wrote in his book:                 A deregulated or market-based HECS will make the student contribution system fairer, because the fees students pay will more closely approximate the value they receive in future earnings.                 So there are Labor members who recognise the private benefit and they expose the extraordinary hypocrisy at the heart of Australia's No. 1 whinger's complaint about higher education reform. He should get on board with the member for McMahon and the member for Fraser.

  The shadow minister, in common with some of her colleagues, is attempting to demonstrate that there has been some breach of promise. There has been none. We made a commitment to DFRDB and DFRB pensioners. We made a commitment to those people in those particular military pensions who previously were indexed at only CPI that they would be indexed at CPI or MTAWE, whichever was the greater.

  I thank the member for Fisher for his question. He has served on the government benches of two governments now that have been responsible for successful border protection policies. I can advise him that there have been no successful ventures this year - none at all over the first five months of this year. That is in stark contrast to the first five months of last year, where I can inform the member there were 156 such ventures, more than a venture day and an average of over 2,000 people arriving every month and over 10,000 over that period. The saving to the budget is $2Â½ billion.                     When I was driving into Parliament House today, there was a car in front of me that had a bumper sticker on the back that said: 'Don't blame me. I voted Labor.' I am not going to blame Labor for these results. They have got absolutely nothing to do with them. We are not going to blame the Labor Party and those who supported the Labor Party for the border successes that this government have been able to achieve. And there are a range of other things that I am not going to blame the Labor Party for.                  I am not going to blame them for cutting a billion dollars in regulatory costs off business. The Prime Minister and the member for Kooyong are achieving that. I am not going to blame Labor for attacking Labor's debt and deficit disaster. The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance are doing that. I am not going to blame the Labor Party for getting Sydney's second airport underway and spending $2Â½ billion on infrastructure in Western Sydney. The Minister for Infrastructure is doing that. I am not going to blame the Labor Party for groundbreaking education reforms for higher education. That is being done by the Minister for Education. I am not going to blame the Labor Party for approving more than $500 billion - that is half a trillion dollars - in project approvals, because that is being done by the Minister for Education. I am not going to blame those opposite for two new trade agreements with Korea and Japan, because that is being done by the Minister for Trade. I am not going to blame those opposite for fixing the mess on the NBN disaster, because that is being done by the Minister for Communications. I am certainly not going to blame those opposite for the job we have done on stopping the boats, because that is as a result of the policies of those on this side of the House.                  We know their messes when we see them and we get about the job in government of fixing them. It is what the Nationals and the Liberals do. We fix Labor's messes. We are very good at it. We have done it many times before. The Australian people know that when you elect a Liberal-National government, we fix up Labor's messes.

  I think the Leader of the Opposition is trying to suggest that somehow a six-week gestation period was inadequate - this from a political party that cooked up the National Broadband Network on the back of a coaster on a VIP flight. Really and truly! The Medical Research Future Fund is a policy based on endowment funds that were created under the former government and for which there is an abundance of precedent in Australian government. If members opposite were more interested in government and less interested in grandstanding, and if they were more interested in policy and less interested in politicking, they would know that well.

  I want to thank the member for McPherson for what is a very timely question. Today we have seen the opposition rediscover a love of truth in election promises and rediscover a concern about cost of living. It is a very interesting proposition, because you will remember that before the election they suddenly decided to terminate the carbon tax. Why would they have wanted to terminate the carbon tax? They wanted to do it because they believed that it would lower prices. They wanted to do it because they believed that it was hurting families. They wanted to do it because they believed that it was hurting small business. Well, if you are concerned today about cost of living and if you are concerned today about so-called truth in election promises, start by making yourselves honest and start by giving Australian families a $550 a year reduction in taxes. Right now, we can reduce the cost of living for Australian families by $550.                  These are the people opposite who before the election would talk like Liberals and after the election vote like Greens. When it came to terminating the carbon tax, what was it that they did? They voted to keep the carbon tax. What occurs on 1 July is that the carbon tax goes up by five per cent. What will occur as a consequence of that? There will be more pressure on electricity, more pressure on gas, more pressure on refrigeration, more pressure on fuels and more pressure on Australian families and businesses. So what we know is this: if you want to save Australian families $550, let's do what the ALP said before the election and terminate the carbon tax. That is what they said. That is what they can do. And I want to make this statement: that we will be bringing back the carbon tax legislation in time for the Senate to consider it in the first two weeks of the new sittings, but if the ALP is willing to give an iron-clad guarantee, as they did before the election, that they would terminate the carbon tax, we will bring it back earlier.                 Most interestingly, we saw the impact of that with the Queensland Competition Authority's announcement last week. They set out two tariffs, one with the carbon tax and one without, and the difference was this: it was a difference, just in electricity terms, of $178 for a family of four without the carbon tax, and $246 a year for a family of six without the carbon tax. So, if you want to reduce the cost of living, get out of the way; stand with us and abolish the carbon tax, and stand for what you said before the election and terminate the carbon tax.

  I stand by my comments, and I simply point out to the shadow minister who asked the question: if it is right and proper for a modest co-payment to be applied to people getting PBS drugs, how can it be wrong and immoral for people to be charged a modest co-payment for a visit to the GP?                     This issue of the so-called the unfairness of co-payments -                      Well, how can it be unfair when Labor imposes a co-payment on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme drugs? How can it be fair for Labor to impose a co-payment and unfair for the coalition to impose a co-payment? This exposes the utter, absolute and total hypocrisy of members opposite.                 We all know that the father of the Medicare co-payment is Bob Hawke; we all know that the mother of the Medicare co-payment is the member for Jagajaga -                      We all know that the son of the Medicare co-payment is the member for Fraser. I have discovered that a kind of cousin of the co-payment is in fact the member for Hunter, who said that the co-payment decision was a very brave one, but it was justifiable; it was a decision designed to address the ever-burgeoning cost while maintaining the scheme's most basic aim: affordability. He was talking about the PBS, but what is right for the PBS is right for Medicare as well.

  I thank the honourable member for her question and I thank her very much for the work that she does, particularly in relation to FASD.                     She is a leader in that area, and I acknowledge the very important work that she does. The universality of Medicare is important, and this is what the Hawke government had to say when they introduced a co-payment: 'The government has not changed the universality of Medicare.                     Medicare services have always been financed by a combination of tax and the Medicare levy based on the relative capacity to pay, and, secondly, patient co-payments, which may of course be waived at the doctor's discretion.'                     The reality is that, when the Hawke government introduced a co-payment, they did so because they wanted to see Medicare sustainable. Labor can pretend that they can rack up debt for ever more, that they can give free services to all Australians, and that somehow the party can continue on. The reality is - and the Australian people know this: it can't; it just can't. Ten years ago we were spending $8 billion a year on Medicare; today we are spending $20 billion a year. As a Commonwealth, we spend $65 billion a year on health; the Medicare levy raises $10 billion. I want to make sure that, as our population ages, and as we get medical services, new technologies, DNA testing and genomics testing - all of this, which will be important for us to fund into the future - we have a sustainable Medicare.                 The Labor Party believed in well-thought-out public policy, once upon a time. When Labor were in government, they put money into GP super clinics. They put it into wasteful programs, including increasing the number of people in the health bureaucracy. But it was not always the case. Back in the Hawke years, Jenny Macklin, as the head of the policy department that advised Brian Howe at that point, said that a co-payment was necessary to make Medicare sustainable. They do not like it but it is true.                 If a Member has given a personal explanation to correct a misrepresentation and another Member subsequently repeats the matter complained of, the Speaker may intervene.                 The Minister for Health is now precisely providing information which the member for Jagajaga has previously explained to the House is false. And I do ask you, on that basis, to intervene.                     All I can go to are the words of Brian Howe, the then health minister, who introduced a co-payment and relied upon advice from the then head of the health directory within the Labor Party, Jenny Macklin. Brian Howe introduced a co-payment. Bob Hawke supported a co-payment, because he wanted sustainability of Medicare.                   We know the member for Fraser - he is in some sort of protection racket at the moment; he has not been out in the press - was a daily offender out there in front of the cameras; he loves the cameras. But they have had him in hiding for the last week. We know, as the son of Bob Hawke, he is here as the defender-in-chief of Medicare's sustainability. He wants a co-payment. He has written about it, and the Labor Party should listen to one of their up-and-coming member's wise views within the Labor Party. He deserves listening to.

  I thank the honourable member for his question, because there is nowhere in Australia -                      where the Labor Party's denial of reality is more evident than in the honourable member's electorate where in July 2013 it was announced that 92 per cent of the premises the NBN had claimed to have passed with fibre - do it once, do it right, do it with fibre - could not be connected. Even if the residents rang up their retail service provider and said, 'Hook us up. We've seen Senator Conroy on the television. We want to be admitted to the new internet nirvana,' nothing could happen. There was no way they could be connected.                  As at the time of the election, 78 per cent of all the premises Labor claimed to have passed with fibre could not be connected. Some of them simply because they did not have any lead in, and so it would take months and months to hook them up; and others because there wasn't even a multiport in the street and there was no foreseeable way in which they could be connected                  We have seen Labor deny the reality of the budget. We have seen them deny the mess they left us in - the $667 billion of debt - but that is a fairly straightforward level of denialism. But there is a deteriorating taxonomy of denialism, when you actually move into a parallel universe - in this case, the parallel universe of Conrovia - where you not only deny the facts; you create an alternative make-believe set of facts and you actually decide. You incentivise a business to pass premises with fibre, regardless of whether they can be connected, because any normal cable business would have as its primary objective to connect people. Why, Madam Speaker? I will let you into the secret: because if you connect people, you can actually get them to pay you something. The Prime Minister is onto it, but there was nobody in the Labor Party that was. What an extraordinary parallel universe they lived in.                  But of course it is not the first time: Lewis Carroll summed this up very, very well. It was a sort of pre-Conrovian parallel universe, and I am reminded of that highly rational woman Alice who was speaking to the White Queen. She says to the White Queen:                 _ one can't believe impossible things.                  And the White Queen says:                  I daresay you haven't had much practice _ I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.                 Thankfully, we are no longer on the wrong side of the looking glass; we are now in the real world - the real world of cleaning up your mess.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. I visited him in April at a childcare centre managed by the Chinese Australian Services Society and I want to congratulate them on the good work that they are doing in Western Sydney, as is the member for Banks. This is a part of our election commitment to revive the teaching of foreign language in schools. As we all know, it is much easier to learn a foreign language when you are small than when you are big. So the coalition has promised nearly $10 million for the Early Learning Languages Australia trial to test the effectiveness of providing preschool children with early exposure to a language other than English through online learning programs. It was a very positive election commitment. Children at up to 40 preschools services will participate in the trial.                 It is important that we recognise the importance of early learning of foreign languages. We recognise that the children involved in this initiative will grow up to participate more and more in a world of work and play that is increasingly integrated and interconnected with our region, more so than ever before. The Liberal and Nationals parties understand the regional flows of trade and investment much more so than Labor. This policy fits well with the coalition's higher education reforms, which also recognise the importance of our students reaching out and living and working in a globally connected world more so than ever before because we face increasing international competition. We need new skills to succeed in the global economy. Improving the take-up of foreign languages will help young people to export businesses and strengthen our economy by giving them the ability to deal with overseas customers and partners.                 Labor has not progressed beyond the prehistoric insular view of education policy. It is time for the Labor Party to wake up and recognise that our students are competing with the rest of the world. Unless we act now, we will be left behind.

  I am delighted to answer this question. There is no doubt that the loans are interest free. It gives me an opportunity to highlight the great regard and delight from industry in relation to the trade support loans. The loans, as the shadow minister knows, are indexed annually with CPI. These loans will offer apprentices the opportunity to receive, over four years, $20,000 which they can use for whatever purpose they like.                     Perhaps, for the shadow minister, I need to repeat: the loans are adjusted with CPI. She may view that as an interest adjustment. Actually, what is happening is the loans are maintaining their real value year-on-year. It does not detract from the fact -                      That is exactly right. The reality is that, on CPI, the indexation will be, on current Reserve Bank estimates, between 2Â½ and three per cent. Those over there, who we know have no understanding of money and finance, may like to equate that to an interest-rate. If they do, it is still more than half the interest-rate for other loans. The reality is that the value of trade support loans in the hands of the apprentice, where they finish their four years, is estimated to be in excess of $12,500, more than double the tools for the trade.

  It is great to see the member for La Trobe back in this place. At last the La Trobe electorate has once again a great champion for small businesses in our city east of Melbourne. The member knows, as we all know on this side of the House, that we need to actually fix the budget to create the stronger economy that we need and to improve the prospects for our small businesses and our family enterprises.                 I shared with this chamber last week the devastating updated figures about the number of jobs lost in our small businesses under Labor. There were 519,000 jobs lost in small businesses in Australia under the previous Labor administration. Just as we know the budget could not keep going on the debt and deficit trajectory that we had inherited, small businesses know that we could not keep going with the policy settings that Labor had implemented that inflicted such pain, such difficulty and such a loss of employment right across our economy.                 The good news for those 12,200 this businesses in La Trobe is we actually have a plan, the only plan, to not only fix the budget mess but to energise enterprise in this country to see what we can do decisively do to stop this loss of employment that is causing such hardship and loss of livelihoods right across our economy and right across our continent.                 So getting the budget right and creating the right economic conditions is all important for building the confidence for small business to grow, and to create the jobs.                  It has been terrific to see the chamber movement, support that initiative. So many of those people are close to small business and know what the Abbott government is doing is exactly what the small-business men and women need: fixing the debt and deficit disaster, building a strong and prosperous economy, getting those conditions right so that people can make the choices to invest to grow their businesses, to create economic and employment opportunities. It is a considered and consistent plan. It is predicable; it is positive; it is the solid platform that small-business men and women are looking for.                 Not only are we getting the budget back on track but the specific measures within the budget see us invest in our future capability. In the member for La Trobe will be interested in the incentives; cutting the company tax will help 800,000 of our small businesses. We are ending the carbon tax. The Minister for the Environment very eloquently outlined how it will reduce the cost of doing business and improve people's livelihoods. It will also relieve the cost pressures on our consumers across the country.                  But there are also specific programs, like the Demand-Driver Infrastructure program for tourism and the Plan for Safer Streets program. And who could forget the enormous investment in infrastructure: the East-West Link in Melbourne, which will not only carry commerce and commuters but will help inject more opportunities for our nation.                 This a budget plan that small business needs. It is the only plan that is on the table. Small business knows they cannot afford more of Labor. Labor should simply get out of the road and let us get on with the job of rebuilding the small business economy.

  Let me make it crystal clear to the member who asked the question: public hospital funding increases by nine per cent this year, nine per cent next year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent in the final year of the forward estimates. That is the truth. The only difference between us and members opposite is that we are slowing the rate of growth of public hospital spending in the final year of this budget's forward estimates because we think that public hospital spending, along with everything else, should be sustainable.                  It is not easy to deal with the debt and deficit disaster that the Labor Party left us. It is not easy to deal with a situation where our country is paying $1 billion in dead money every single month just in interest on the borrowings. It is not easy to deal with this. But this government will do what it was elected to do and get the budget back under control.                  As for the specific measure that the member who asked the question is concerned about, this is something that the former government cut. This is a cut that the former government made. It was not there in the pre-election fiscal outlook. It is a Labor cut, and I say to the states and territories: 'Know who is responsible for this: it is them. It is members on the other side of the House.'

  I thank the member for her question. And let me say it is great to have a wonderful new member for Dobell who is passionate about the interests of her electorate and who is passionate about the interests of young people in Dobell and creating opportunities for our young people. I was delighted on Friday to visit the Central Coast Wetlands Pioneer Dairy, a great local community project, driven by great volunteers, with the support of a Work for the Dole team, sponsored through Break Thru People Solutions.                  It was a great project. The local member introduced me to a number of motivated job seekers who have been working on that program, and they said to me that Work for the Dole had changed their attitude to the workplace. We know the members opposite hate Work for the Dole. It is in their DNA to hate Work for the Dole.                     But Work for the Dole is a program that can deliver great community outcomes and deliver great skills to young job seekers. When I spoke to the participants, they were glowing in their praise of Work for the Dole and the way in which Work for the Dole had changed their attitude to work and the workplace. I spoke to a young man called Aaron. When Aaron started his placement, he initially he did not travel too well. He had a bit of trouble getting involved in the program. But over time his skills developed, and every day he used to enjoy getting up and getting on with the project and being part of delivering the outcomes at Pioneer Dairy.                    -                      I am pleased to report to the House - the members opposite might not be interested - but I am pleased to report to the House -                      The members opposite will not want to hear this, but Aaron was able to tell me that he had secured a job, which was great news, through Work for the Dole. We know the members have spent their time running down the Work for the Dole program that they inherited from the Howard era, but this government is committed. I announced phase 1 last week of the revamped Work for the Dole which will scale up the Work for the Dole program. And today I released a survey, and that survey said:                 Making basic adjustments to their attitude and physical presentation is the most effective thing that many young job seekers can do to improve their employment prospects.                 That is why we are increasing the amount of Work for the Dole programs available. That is why we are increasing the number of opportunities for young people to develop the sorts of skills which have been run down under the members opposite.                 We believe in the ability of Work for the Dole to deliver the skills that young people need to get a leg up in the workplace - to get that start that they need; to deliver the skills that employers want. We on this side of the House support Work for the Dole. The members opposite in their time in government ran down Work for the Dole.

  It is so typical -                      It is so typical, I regret to say, of this opposition leader -                      and this opposition that they have a political critique but not an economic critique. The reason for that is that this budget is a serious attempt to address the economic disaster that members opposite created. This budget is a real plan, a real economic action strategy, to deal with the predicament that this country faces as a result of six years of incompetence and dishonesty from members opposite. We have a plan for the future of our country. All the Leader of the Opposition has is one long complaint - no solutions; all complaint. That is why the people of Australia can trust this government.                   I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  Is it 'days' or is it 'weeks'? There is a difference. This is a government which has brought down a budget which is not only about living within our means; it is also about playing to our strengths. And one of Australia's great strengths is medical research.                  Some eight Nobel Prize winners from this country were medical researchers, including Howard Florey, the inventor of penicillin. Over the last decade we have had some four Australians of the year who are medical researchers, including Fiona Wood, the inventor of plastic skin; and Ian Frazer, the inventor of the cervical cancer vaccine. We are very, very good at medical research. We are outstanding at medical research. We are one per cent of the world's population and we produce some five per cent of the world's refereed medical research.                  This is a budget not just for saving but a budget for building. That is why I am so proud of the Medical Research Future Fund. It will help this country and help the world in the years and decades ahead.

  I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I can inform him that the government's Economic Action Strategy is about building a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. If you want a stronger economy you have to fix the budget; and if you want to fix the budget you have to tackle Labor's debt and deficit disaster.                 The former Labor government, which members opposite were part of for six years, gave this country the six biggest deficits in our history. It increased unemployment by 200,000 as well as giving us the six biggest deficits in our history - $240 billion of deficit, almost a quarter of a trillion dollars of deficit, in Labor's six budgets. These are deficits stretching as far as the eye can see. And every year you are in deficit adds to the debt; Labor's debt, in a decade's time, would be $667 billion, and every dollar of debt adds to the interest bill. The price that Australians are paying for six years of Labor incompetence is $1 billion a month. That is just to pay the interest on Labor's borrowings. In a decade, it would have been $3 billion a month, just to pay the interest on Labor's borrowings.                  The coalition did not cause the problem but we are prepared to take responsibility for fixing it. We were elected to fix the problem, and fix it we will. That is why this budget reduces projected maximum debt by almost $300 billion. We will take the projected deficit in 2017-18 from about $30 billion to under $3 billion within sight of surplus. Less debt means lower interest rates; a lower deficit means that we can do things like scrap the carbon tax and help households to the tune of $550 every single year. But that is not all. We have negotiated two free trade agreements, with Korea and Japan; that means more exports. Thanks to the Environment Minister, we have approved $500 billion in new projects, and that means more jobs. This is a government with a plan, with an economic action strategy. Unfortunately we have an opposition which just has one long complaint.

  I am very pleased that Ambassador Najib is back in Australia. I am obviously very pleased that I will be meeting with President Yudhoyono tomorrow, because it is important that the relationship between Australia and Indonesia continues to improve. This is a very important relationship; in some respects, our most important relationship. I am determined to do everything I can to improve the relationship. I am particularly keen to ensure that the relationship improves while President Yudhoyono is in office, because, not only has he been a great president of his country, he has also been a very good friend to Australia.                  As the member opposite should know, these international agreements sometimes take a little while to negotiate. There were free trade agreements that members opposite tried to negotiate; they took years and years and years. It has taken a little while to negotiate. The Indonesians took some time to give us their draft, and we are now working on their draft. I am confident that, when the foreign ministers and the defence ministers sit down for the two-plus-two dialogue in a few weeks' time, that would be a very good time to finalise this code of conduct.

  I thank the honourable member for the question and recognise that it is hugely important that we repeal the mining tax, because the mining tax has been a blight on the economic landscape of Australia since it was first invented by the member for Lilley. I want to apologise to the House, because I was a bit tough on the former Labor Treasurer Andrew Fisher. One hundred years ago, Andrew Fisher invented a tax that only fell short by 96 per cent. I thought at the time that the mining tax fell short by 95 per cent. But, since the last budget, we have now revised it to recognise that the mining tax is 97 per cent short. So the member for Lilley gets the golden handcuff for coming up with the worst tax in Australian history.                 Now we are starting to get a picture of why Labor promised four surpluses in a row. It was because they were basing it on taxes that raised no money. Only the Labor Party could come up with a tax that raises no money. It is only a one in 100 year event, but both events occurred under a Labor treasurer. So that is a great tribute to the member for Lilley!                 The Leader of the Opposition said, 'We want to keep that tax. It has been such a great success story' - having a tax that raises no money - 'that we want to keep it.' 'That is good economic policy,' says the Leader of the Opposition. But he goes along to the Minerals Council and he whispers in their ear, 'Don't worry, it will go, because there are people in the House and in the Senate who understand mining and they're going to get rid of it. They've got the numbers. Don't worry. We really want to get rid of this tax' - but 'We so want to get rid of this tax, we're going to vote to keep it.' That is the consistency of the Leader of the Opposition.                 But I am very pleased to report that there is one canary in the mine. There is a report of an unnamed Western Australian Labor member -                      Unnamed. Who might that be? I do not know who that might be!                     I do not want to name her, but she apparently told caucus, 'We've got to get rid of this damn tax.' We agree - let's get rid of this damn mining tax. Against that mining tax that raises no money is $16 billion of expenditure. So every day Labor opposes getting rid of the mining tax it costs the budget and the Australian people.

  Let's talk about the GP co-payment. The GP co-payment is a sensible measure from this government to try to make Medicare sustainable for the long term. How can members opposite insist that it is right to have a modest co-payment for the PBS and it is somehow wrong to have a modest co-payment for Medicare? It just does not add up.                     The member for Jagajaga likes to interject. Let me quote from the National Health Strategy.                     I am quoting from a document called the National Health Strategy. The National Health Strategy said: 'There is considerable pragmatic appeal in the use of co-payments.' Then I read on:                 For further information about the National Health Strategy contact Jenny Macklin, Director, National Health Strategy.                 So 'Considerable pragmatic appeal in the use of co-payments.' But it does not stop there.                     We know the direct ministerial author of the co-payments was a gentleman called Brian Howe, former Deputy Prime Minister. Jenny Macklin said of Brian Howe:                 Brian Howe, as many on this side will know, has been a wonderful source of inspiration to me _                 She went on to say:                 It is a great challenge now to be able to bring those ideas into this place.                 She did not have the guts to do that, but this government does.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. The short answer to her question is yes and that in fact is our policy. If I can explain the history of this matter for the honourable member's benefit, during the Howard government substantial amounts of money were spent rectifying mobile phone black spots. As all honourable members from regional seats know very well, the biggest single telecommunications complaint is no mobile phone coverage. That is by far the biggest problem. Remarkably, for six years under the previous government not one cent was spent to address mobile phone black spots. As the honourable member for Indi has observed, we have committed $100 million in the budget.                  When the NBN was established by the previous government, it had no mandate whatsoever to assist in mobile phone coverage. The then chief executive, Mr Quigley, admitted that in a committee hearing. We have instructed the NBN Co to, wherever possible, find opportunities where it can offer collocation and support for mobile network operators. There are a number of areas - it is not the majority of the 2,700 towers that will be established for the NBN - where there is fixed wireless coverage under the NBN Co planned where there is no mobile phone coverage or mobile phone coverage of poor quality, or mobile phone coverage from only one of the three carriers. So yes, there are opportunities to do that.                 The NBN Co is also looking at a tower access product that will provide competitive backhaul from mobile phone towers to thereby reduce the cost of establishing new services in these areas via the mobile network operators. So we are looking at every way we can support this, but this is not a silver bullet. The honourable member should understand - I am sure she does understand - that the fixed wireless footprint is obviously focused on areas where there are premises to be serviced and that the black spots tend to occur in areas of thinner population.                 It is an important part of the mission of the NBN Co and over the top of all of that we have the mobile phone black spots policy.  My parliamentary secretary, the member for Bradfield, has been across the length and breadth of the country identifying these opportunities and he has done an outstanding job to ensure that this scheme will be designed and will get absolutely best value for taxpayers.

  I thank the member for Dawson for his question, coming as it does from one of the champions of the Fix the Bruce campaign. During those long years in opposition, coalition members at state and federal level were travelling up and down the coast to draw attention to the inadequacies of the Bruce Highway and the need to commit substantial funds to make it into the road that the 21st century demands. Arising out of the Fix the Bruce campaign, the coalition and the Queensland government agreed to an $8.5 billion package to upgrade the Bruce Highway and $6.7 billion of that came from the Commonwealth government. The honourable member, like me, would have been delighted to see the commitment to deliver on that package in the coalition's first federal budget. We announced 45 new projects and continuing funding for 16 more. That will make a real difference in helping to get this road up to standard, making it more flood proof, increasing its capacity and making it a safer road for people to travel on. Our $6.7 billion commitment compares with $4.1 billion that the Labor Party had put on the table for this major highway. In addition, the Labor Party money was conditional on the Queensland government paying a 50 per cent contribution, when the traditional mix on the national highway network has been 80 to 20. In reality, Labor had no real plan to deliver the money at all. There were so many barbs and conditions attached to their funding offer that, in reality, many of the projects would not have proceeded. In the budget, there are some substantial commitments to the electorate of Dawson. I know the member has a particular interest in the Mackay ring road, which will be a $565 million project. The initial $11.6 million is being provided for planning and land acquisition to get that project underway. But there is more than that. There is a start on the $57 million Sandy Gully bridge project and the $45 million Yellow Gin bridge project - they both have their initial funding in this budget. On top of that there is the Vantassel Street to Cluden duplication in the southern part of Townsville. There will be $48 million extra provided to get that project underway and towards completion.                 So there are real commitments to real projects, getting jobs underway. Under this government there will be a concerted effort to fix the Bruce and to make a difference for all of those people who depend on that vital highway.

  I might equally well ask the shadow minister opposite: why did the former government introduce a PBS tax? What this government has done in respect of Medicare is exactly what the Labor Party did in respect of the PBS. It is exactly the same. If it was right to have a modest co-payment for the PBS, how can it be wrong to have a modest co-payment for Medicare? When members opposite brought in a modest co-payment for the PBS they said, 'It is to make this system sustainable, to continue to have it accessible, to continue to have it affordable, to continue to have it universal, but to make it sustainable.' It is exactly the same argument, exactly the same ethical and moral considerations, which have led us to do exactly the same for Medicare which the Labor Party did for the PBS - exactly the same for Medicare.                 The former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, the former Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe, the former director of the national health strategy, the member for Jagajaga - we are doing for Medicare exactly what they proposed. We are doing for Medicare exactly what Labor's Assistant Treasurer proposes - that is, to make this great Medicare system of ours sustainable for the long term.

  Madam Speaker, when we are talking about public hospital funding from this government, there is a nine per cent increase this year, a nine per cent increase the year after, a nine per cent increase the year after that, and a six per cent increase -                      in the final year of the budget. What is so wrong with nine per cent, nine per cent, nine per cent and six per cent? Where is the problem? We are increasing public hospital funding. Every single year, public hospital funding increases: by nine per cent this year, by nine per cent next year, by nine per cent the year after that and by six per cent the year after that.                 The difference between this government and members opposite is that we want public hospital funding to be sustainable. We want public hospital funding to be sustainable. As for subacute beds, that was funding that the former government did not see fit to put in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. It did not see fit to put it in the pre-election fiscal outlook. All we get from members opposite is no solutions; all complaint. They are running the national complaints bureau and, frankly, the people of Australia are looking for better.

  I thank the member for Forde for his question. I can tell him that the impact of Operation Sovereign Borders has been that, since 19 December, there has been no successful maritime people-smuggling venture to Australia - not one. Not one since 19 December. That is a critical period of time because that is the time when we moved into the second phase, effectively, of Operation Sovereign Borders, where turn-backs were introduced as part of the set of policy measures that were being put in place by the government. So there were no successful ventures.                 I am asked about the savings, about what the cost might have been had these policies not been changed. I can inform the House that in the budget there are savings as a result of the success this government is having in stopping the boats. There are savings in the budget of $2.5 billion. It reads like this over this year and the forward estimates: $212 million saved this year; $960 million saved next year; $808 million saved the year after; $337.2 million in the second-last year of the out years; and $192.2 million. Stopping the boats saves this budget, year on year on year on year. Under those opposite, it cost us year on year on year - budget blow-outs of $11.5 billion. And those opposite come in here and lecture this side on economic management - unbelievable!                 The truth is, though, that the savings are actually far greater, because as we know the budget is based on the midyear estimates, so these are just the savings off the MYEFO. If I go back to the PEFO - as we know, the PEFO is where the officials tell the truth about what the budget really is from the previous government. That is what it does.                     That is what it does. Officials come together - and let me tell me you what your officials said.                     Let me tell you what they said. They said this year -                      under the previous government's policy, there would have been -                      This year, that is how many people were going to turn up on their government's policy. I can tell you what the estimate is this year, Madam Speaker. It is 7,667, and 85 per cent of those turned up in the first 2Â½ months, while that mob were in government. So the savings would have been far greater if we compared it to what that mob left us, if the policies had not been not changed. On simple arithmetic, it would have been over $4 billion.

  The shadow minister is labouring under a misapprehension.                     I presume he would not be telling a deliberate untruth, but the simple reality is that, every year, school and hospital funding increases under this government. Every year, school and hospital funding increases under this government. Public hospitals: nine per cent this year, nine per cent next year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent in the final year. And, from memory, for schools funding it is eight per cent this year, eight per cent next year, eight per cent the year after that and four per cent the year after that. So we are continuing to generously fund public schools and public hospitals. In fact, when it comes to public schools in Queensland, we are doing so much better than members opposite. The Leader of the Opposition neglected to put $1.2 billion into the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook - simple truth.                     He cannot help himself. He is constantly interjecting, but I am afraid he is just embarrassed about the fact that he was not strong enough to keep $1.2 billion in the pre-election fiscal outlook. That is $1.2 billion ripped off from Queensland schools by that Leader of the Opposition and put back by this government.

  I thank the member for his question. He is very concerned about making sure we can get more support into rural communities, and we want to make sure that in this budget we strengthen Medicare.                     In this budget we have recognised the fact that we just cannot sustain giving away for free all these services that Labor proposes - that somehow you can put that on the credit card and that it is sustainable going forward. That is the problem that Labor has.                 I want to start by acknowledging the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We spend about $9 billion a year in this country on a great medicine scheme. I want to say thank you to the Labor Party for their support of a co-payment in the PBS in the 1960s. And I want to say thank you very much to the Labor Party for their support of a co-payment during the 1970s, when we saw an increase in the number of people that accessed the PBS and paid a co-payment. I want to thank the Labor Party for supporting a co-payment during the 1980s. I want to recognise that, in 1986, the Labor Party increased the PBS co-payment by 100 per cent, from $5 to $10, for general patients. I want to thank the Labor Party for supporting a co-payment in relation to the PBS in the nineties. In fact, it was the Labor Party, in 1991, that said that they wanted to keep the PBS sustainable and a co-payment was necessary. And it was the Labor Party, in 1991, that first introduced a co-payment for pensioners - not worried about those without means, not worried about those people who are most sick.                  Labor's argument for 50 years has been that a co-payment is necessary to make the PBS sustainable. During all of that period, they have said the co-payment is a sensible policy. Now why would they oppose a co-payment to make Medicare sustainable? Because they are playing politics. For 50 years the Labor Party have supported a co-payment principle, and yet in the last 24 hours the shadow minister for health has referred to a co-payment on the PBS as a tax - a tax that they presided over for 50 years. If anybody ever needed any evidence of their hypocrisy and of the Labor Party playing politics, look no further than her comments of the last 24 hours. I saw the shadow minister's performance on Q&amp;A last night. I have got to say it takes a special talent -                      for a member of the Labor Party to fail on Q&amp;A and to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. It really says a lot about the Labor Party. I want to make sure, as the Australian public does, that we can have a sustainable Medicare, and we will do that.                     The point is that the Labor Party are full of hypocrisy. They have no solution to make Medicare sustainable. This party was elected to clean up Labor's mess. We will do that. We will make Medicare sustainable for generations to come. The Labor Party just needs to get out of the -

  I thank the honourable member for his question, and I know that he has a particularly keen interest in his own electorate in getting the NBN rolled out quickly, cost-effectively and affordably. I can say that the most significant impact on the budget from the new approach to the NBN is that we are confronting the reality of the project. We are not in a sort of La-La Land of Conrovian economics, where you can believe that you can build things for half the cost it will really cost and you can believe that you can pass hundreds of thousands of premises with fibre but not offer any ability to connect. We are back in the real world and, since the election, we have got a plan to get the NBN back on track.                 Since September, twice as many Australians are using the NBN - from 90,000 premises to 191,000 premises. We have increased the number of premises covered by the network by two-thirds, 65 per cent. In the built-up areas, the brownfield areas, we have tripled the number of premises connected, to 91,000 premises. Call us old-fashioned, but we are focused on actually getting paying customers on the network, because we have this old-fashioned view that you will not generate any revenue unless you have got customers and you will not generate any improvement in the broadband experience of Australians unless they are actually connected.                 This is a critically important part of the budget repair process, because it is vital that we focus - unlike the opposition leader, who denied reality throughout his budget-in-reply speech - on the facts and get on with it. We have seen Conrovian economics from the very shy spokesman on broadband, the member for Blaxland. He may be the member for Blaxland, but he is no Paul Keating. He is really 'Young Jellyback,' he is so shy at asking questions. But, anyway, he has put out press releases saying that the NBN Co could borrow $43 billion without any government guarantee.                 It is unfair to suggest that everybody in the Labor Party is a Conrovian because, as usual, the member for Fraser every now and then says something sensible. Only on 15 May, he said -                      'I think infrastructure is a good thing, but I do see a risk.'                     Madam Speaker, could I have a little more time, please.

  We all know where the problem is: it is members opposite, who are in denial about the debt and deficit disaster that this country faces because of six years of incompetence.                 For the benefit of the member who asked the question, this year there is a nine per cent increase in public hospital funding. Next year it is nine per cent and the year after that it is nine per cent and, in the final year, it is six per cent. When it comes to public schools, this year it is an eight per cent increase -                      Next year it is an eight per cent increase and the year after that it is an eight per cent increase. Madam Speaker, I got it wrong: it is not a four per cent increase; it is actually a six per cent increase for public schools in the final year. This is a government which is sustainably supporting the great public schools and the great public hospitals of this country. What we are not doing is pretending that we can forever put the mortgage on the Bankcard and that is what members opposite tried to do. And that is why this country is now paying $1 billion every single month in interest on the borrowings. That is the price that every single Australian has to pay for Labor's incompetence. We did not create the problem, but we will fix it.

  It is great to take a question from the member for Leichhardt. Labor's flexibility trials have continued to be a flop. These were much-touted attempts by the previous government to demonstrate that parents need flexibility in child care. I am not sure why they needed an expensive $1.3 million measure to prove something we have always known, which is that parents want flexible, affordable child care. Unfortunately, only 244 families have so far accessed the pilot program. Seven of the initial trial sites are not providing flexible care, so it is the most inflexible 'flexibility trial' you could possibly imagine. Many parents were asked to enrolment mid-year, which is about the time when you are already well and truly settled in the childcare centre that you have chosen for your child. It was another expensive Labor mess.                     What a tattered Labor legacy in child care the Labor Party have left us. In fact, the only thing right about Labor's childcare policy was its title 'Labor's Affordable Child Care Plan.' In fact, they sat on their hands while childcare costs went up and affordability went down. Who can forget the double drop-off where 260 centres were promised and only 38 were built? What about the introduction of a new framework, which was just as much about red tape as it ever was about quality? We appreciate the quality, we sign off on the quality, but we do not sign off on the red tape that comes with it. In centre after centre that I go into I see trained, passionate, intelligent preschool teachers locked in an office, just filling in the paperwork. If the children want an exercise where they make a cake, they have to do a risk assessment on the hand-held beaters. That is just one example. Paperwork after paperwork, all shoved in a corner, all archived for 21 years, with no coherent narrative, no plan - just one dog's breakfast of a policy after another. And then, on the eve of the election -                      If the member for Adelaide yelled as hard at the tactics committee, as she does at me, she might get a question up. On the eve of the election we saw another expensive bandaid, the Early Years Quality Fund - a Labor union slush fund - which was in fact scrambled by the member for Adelaide for United Voice to hand out in the streets of her electorate. She was worried about her vote. This was just a union slush fund.                     This was just a union slush fund. We have a Productivity Commission inquiry into how to fix up Labor's mess. Labor put politics before parents. What a shameful legacy for Australia's children.

  The shadow minister should just for once tell the truth. The truth is that there is a nine per cent increase this year, a nine per cent increase next year, a nine per cent increase the year after that and a six per cent increase in the final year. Hospital funding goes up substantially every single year. The shadow minister for foreign affairs should stop trying to scare the patients of Australia. She should come up with some solutions and put the complaints aside. If she is serious about replacing the Leader of the Opposition, she might as well start with a few ideas of her own.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member's seat of Mallee is home to the Mallee-Wimmera pipeline. I just noted this morning it did an inquiry and the Mallee-Wimmera pipeline is paying about $100,000 a year in carbon tax, so not only are we delivering water to all the people growing tomatoes, grapes and cereals but we are also delivering a Green-Labor Party tax. I do not know quite what the purpose of that is. But the member for Mallee would know that the person who ultimately pays the tax is the lady pushing the shopping trolley in the supermarket.                     Or the man.                     I know that Labor and the Greens would be upset about hearing the answer, but we also note that to this day they stand behind a new tax on fuel on 1 July this year, a new tax of 6.85c a litre -                      on all transport costs. It is amazing how they get themselves completely in a flux about an excise of less than a cent but they still stand behind a tax of 6.85c a litre on all transport so that anybody transporting tomatoes out of the Mallee, transporting grapes, transporting milk, transporting beef has to pay a transport tax. Who pays the transport tax? It is the gentleman pushing the shopping trolley.                 The perverseness does not stop there. If we take a bullock from the seat of Mallee and we take it to an abattoir and on processing that bullock, on breaking it down, we take the carbon emissions of that abattoir over 25,000 tonnes then that bullock is responsible for the crystallisation of a tax of 25,000 tonnes by $25.40, $635,000 for the processing of that bullock. Who pays that? It goes all the way through the cold store, all the way through the butcher's shop and lands on the family pushing the shopping trolley. Why are they paying this tax? They are paying this tax because of the Green-Labor Party solidarity, but they do not respect the mandate of the Australian people, they do not respect the views of the Australian public. The only thing they respect is the Green-Labor alliance.

 It is a major commitment of the government, led by the member for Macarthur at the election, to invest in the WestConnex project and also in the Western Sydney plan. The infrastructure Prime Minister made clear before the election that we would invest $1Â½ billion in WestConnex stage 1, which, in the budget, we have ensured that we have followed through with. Also in the budget, we announced that WestConnex stage 2 would go ahead, 18 months early, because of the first ever federal government concessional loan for a road project to bring that project forward by 18 months and all the benefits that it brings with it. Last week, New South Wales Minister Duncan Gay and I announced that the first stage of WestConnex stage 2 will get underway, with the planning application for the King Georges Road intersection and the M5 being lodged and the community consultation process beginning.                  This is a project which will transform Sydney utterly. It will see, in combination with WestConnex stage 1, reduced travel times between Parramatta Road and Sydney airport by 40 minutes, halving bus travel times in the inner west of the city and bypassing up to 52 sets of traffic lights. It will remove 3,000 trucks a day from Parramatta Road by putting them underground, leading to neighbourhood revitalisation. And it will create 10,000 jobs during construction.                  In addition to that, we have also started work on our Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan, our $3Â½ billion plan, to build the infrastructure in Western Sydney. Last Friday, we announced that the contract had been awarded on the planning for Bringelly Road to begin that project later this year, led by the New South Wales government. It is a project which the Labor Party is opposed to - amazingly. The member for Chifley and the local members in the western part of Sydney are opposed to the $3Â½ billion being spent in Western Sydney. It is quite extraordinary. They are also opposed to the WestConnex project. They are opposed utterly to the WestConnex project. The Victorian members are opposed to the East West project - $3 billion from this government to get the East West project going. The member for Kingston is opposed to the Darlington Upgrade in South Australia, which will benefit her electorate more than any other. She is opposed to it. The member for Perth, who has had other things on her mind today, is opposed, with the Greens, to the Perth Freight Link project.                  What we are seeing here is an opposition which is utterly obsessed by politics and which does not understand policy at all. It wants to get utterly in the way of ensuring that we have a stronger Australia, led by an infrastructure Prime Minister. We are going to get on with it. We are going to get on with ensuring that we build the infrastructure of the 21st century.

  I am happy to take the question because, underneath the attempted humour, I presume there is a serious intent. The member asking the question wants to know what the policies of the United States government and the Australian government on climate change have in common. I can tell him that there is no carbon tax in the United States. There is no emissions trading scheme in the United States. This government is determined to ensure that there will be no carbon tax or emissions trading scheme here in Australia. What the United States is doing is taking sensible direct action steps to reduce its emissions, which is exactly what this government is proposing to do. We are proposing to put sensible measures in place to protect our environment. It is not sensible to protect the environment by damaging the economy, and that is why neither the United States nor Australia should have a carbon tax.

  I thank the member for Higgins. Unlike those opposite, the member for Higgins fully understands that it is business, large and small, that is best placed to drive sustainable economic growth and therefore jobs.                     Don't you talk! 519,000 lost jobs in the small business sector in your term of office. You ought to keep quiet on this question. It is business, large and small, not the hand of big government through unsustainable debt fuelled spending, not a continuation of the firestorm of choking regulation, not more futile and job-destroying taxes, not more decisions taken at the behest of the unions and the Greens - it is business, large and small, that drives sustainable growth. For this reason we are trying to displace big government and replace it with robust growth of the private sector. Improved trade and investment is an important part of driving that robust growth of the private sector.                 Concluding significant trade agreements opens up new doors for business. They lead to job creation. They lead to growth. We have concluded landmark agreements with Korea and Japan. We have achieved in seven months what those opposite could not do in six years and six months. We suspect Labor failed to conclude an agreement not because of incompetence - no, not incompetence; they did not have their heart in it. They were following the instructions of their anti-trade union bosses.                     We saw a firestorm of regulation going through this place at your behest, Leader of the Opposition. The Korean agreement will add $650 million a year to our economy. It will create more than 15,000 jobs, excluding significant services gains. The Japan agreement will open up major new export opportunities for a range of agriculture, horticulture and services. The beef industry alone is going to see increases of some $300 million to $400 million a year. We are making good progress with the free trade agreement with China - we concluded another round this morning and it gives me even more optimism that we can conclude this year. This will deliver, again, further gains.                  On the investment front, since the First Fleet we have relied on foreign investment to help grow the economy, and that remains true today. Over the last seven months I have chaired 28 investment roundtables in 10 countries. It is delivering results. We are seeing billions of dollars come into Australia. Those opposite left behind a real mess. We are making a strong start to finishing it.

  I thank the honourable member for the question. It was totally unexpected, given that he has done a few press announcements about it earlier today. I agree with the honourable member: it has been the coalition that stopped the boats, it has been the coalition that has closed now nine detention centres, it is the coalition that has saved $2.5 billion from the budget. But let me talk a bit about the PEFO, the Pre-election Fiscal Outlook that is released by the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary -                      I am coming to you in a minute, china. Just relax. And the secretary of the Department of Finance. The fact is that it reflects the government's policy at that time and the policy assumptions that form the basis of the government's policy at that time. As we know, the Labor Party assumed that growth in expenditure would be limited to two per cent if they were re-elected.                     The problem was that it was 3.7 per cent. Oops! So of course Labor claimed they were going to get back to surplus one day into the future, but the assumptions that underpinned it were flawed and there are a number of areas where they were actively deceptive. For example, the Labor Party, if they were re-elected, would have had to put money into the Reserve Bank.                     No? $8.8 billion I had to put into the Reserve Bank, and why? Because the Labor Party when in government had taken extraordinary dividends and in fact materially weakened the capacity of the Reserve Bank to respond to unforeseen circumstances. So we had to put $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank. Then buried deep in the Economic Statement of the former Treasurer was a commitment to over 14,000 Public Service redundancies, 14,500 Public Service redundancies that the Labor Party did not have the courage to explain to the Public Service. Did they fund those redundancies? No, they did not. Shock and surprise. And there are other areas. They failed to properly finance the ACCC, they took $1.2 billion from Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory in relation to the so-called Gonski funding. We know it is the old story: the Labor Party wrecks the joint, the coalition has to come in to fix it. That is exactly what has happened. That is one of the reasons why I am absolutely positive our forecasts are more accurate than anything they have ever delivered.

  The Treasurer has already given a complete and thorough answer to this question. He has demonstrated why the figures in PEFO were different when it came to MYEFO -                      that the Labor Party have not told the truth about underprovided for expenditure to which they were committed, areas that they had stripped away in the budget in ways which were not reported in the initial statement but which had come to account when it reached the stage of MYEFO. What about the 14,000 redundancies that Labor promised in the Public Service, yet they had not bothered to provide for any redundancy payments? Essentially, this information was withheld in those initial reports. In many other areas as well, Labor had made commitments but had not funded them. Those are the sorts of things we had to take into account when preparing the budget that is before the parliament at the present time. They are the sorts of things which gave the previous government the reputation of having not been honest about its finances and delivering appalling debts. But the true situation was even worse than they had reported to the people.

  I thank the honourable member for Longman for his question. The Australian economy grew by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter this year.                 The question will be how quickly mining investment comes off and how quickly new investment in the non-mining side of the economy continues. But, unquestionably - and this is the difference, you have to look through the figures rather than get too excited about the headline - export volumes in the last quarter were exceptional. One of the reasons for that is, thankfully, we did not have any cyclone activity during the March quarter which meant that the miners were able to get the volume out the door, and they dug deep into inventories and that should recover. But the fact is mining volume was exceptional in this quarter.                  The net result is that it is the highest percentage increase since September 2000. As a result, we have the smallest current account deficit as a share of GDP since March 1980. I was 14 years of age in 1980 and the member for Longman was 10 years away from being born. So you see, the key is jobs. I remember this Leader of the Opposition standing at the dispatch box railing against the government's activity on jobs. In the first four months of this year, 106,000 new jobs have been created, 79,000 full-time jobs created. So we are on track, let our budget be on track.

  Clearly, as the Treasurer has just reported, the account figures are encouraging. It is a clear demonstration of the fact that we have government now that has declared Australia open for business and is already starting to make a difference. But we are by no means yet out of the woods. There is still a lot more work that will have to be done.                     We have still got to have a succession of budgets that turn around the cycle of deficits which Labor delivered - the five biggest deficits in our country's history. Our debt continues to rise, already costing us $1 billion a month in interest, and, if left unchecked, would peak at $667 billion. So we have got a long, hard task ahead of us. We needed a budget at this time that demonstrated to the community that we were prepared to take the tough decisions -                      and to get our economy on the straight and narrow once again. We need to demonstrate that we are there for the long run; that we are prepared to make the decisions which will deliver for our country not just one good quarterly result but repeat that again and again and again, so our nation can reach the stage where it can stand proud once again and we can achieve our potential, and deliver for the Australian people the services and facilities that they want.                     We welcome the growth figures that have been announced today, but there is still a long, long task ahead of us.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I wish he would not vote against the appropriation bills; I wish he would not do that, notwithstanding the fact that the opposition is obviously not going to block supply, as it is commonly known. And why? Because Australians expect stable government, no matter who it is. They expect stable government. And they expect that the government should be able to engage in appropriations for the best interests of the economy and the best interests of the community. I understand that you are seeking to make a point about the budget, but it is more a political point than a policy point. I wish we would get some constructive policy suggestions from all of those critics, because no-one is offering a credible alternative.                 In the brief moment I had between a press conference on the national accounts and coming into question time, I managed to hear Bob Hawke. He is a good man, Bob Hawke.                     He is a real leader of the Labor Party. I bet they wish they had Bob Hawke back! But they do not.                     Bob Hawke said, 'Sooner or later, an opposition needs to provide alternative policies if they really want to get elected.' The Labor Party created the budget mess. They are doing everything they can to stop us from fixing it. Even they have actually, in part, admitted that there is a budget mess. Old buggerlugs over there, the member for Lilley, confessed to Bob Carr that there is a real budget mess, and of course the Leader of the Opposition suggested there is a real budget 'task'.                     A 'task'! I suggest that is a call to action, in some sort. But there is a budget task. The thing is: the Labor Party is offering no alternative. Indeed, Member for Denison: what is your alternative? What is your alternative to Labor's legacy of $667 billion of debt? What is your alternative to Labor's legacy of deficits as far as the eye can see? What is your alternative to Labor's legacy of unemployment rising to 6Â¼ per cent - of over 700,000 Australians being unemployed? What are your policy alternatives over there? There are none. And why? Because we have the chief clerk of the national complaints desk here, who is more about complaining than providing an alternative scenario. We know the budget is difficult. We know the budget is tough. The fiscal consolidation is less than budgets we have brought down in previous years, and less than Labor's previous budgets. But the budget is right for Australia and it is right for the Australian economy.

  I thank the honourable member for her question, and  recognise her electorate is quite large. In fact, it is the largest single electorate in the world - probably outside of a totalitarian state, I would suggest! But it is the largest electorate in the world. And of course there is a heavy reliance on everything from road transport to energy in her electorate.                 The carbon tax is a handbrake on economic growth. There is no doubt about that. And before the election our political opponents recognised that, in a sense, and said that they were going to terminate the carbon tax. The problem is: they are doing everything they can to stop us from terminating the carbon tax. If we repeal the carbon tax, the size of the economy will be about 0.3 per cent higher than it otherwise would have been in 2020. It is actually a tax of $9 billion a year on the economy now, and in four weeks time, unless it is repealed by the Senate in the interim, the legislated carbon tax will go up another five per cent, to $25.40 a tonne. That is three times the size of the European carbon price - three times the size! And the Labor Party are defending that.                 If the carbon tax remains in place, the cost to the economy is enormous. It would cost the Western Australian economy over $200 billion out to 2050 and it would cost the Australian economy over a trillion dollars out to the same point of time.                 But it costs families; and if we abolish the carbon tax now we can immediately reduce the cost to the average household by $550 a year - $550 a year! According to Treasury, the expected impact of the tax on real wages rises to about 2.6 per cent by 2030, which is around $2,000 of average full-time wages.                 Ultimately, if we get rid of the carbon tax we can strengthen the Australian economy. That is the bottom line. That is why we went to the last election saying to the Australian people, 'We want to abolish the carbon tax,' because we want to strengthen the Australian economy, we want to strengthen household budgets and we want to ensure that we can compete on a level playing field with the rest of the world.                 The only problem is our political opponents, who said before the election that they wanted to terminate the carbon tax. Instead, they come into this place and do everything they can to prevent us from terminating the carbon tax. If the Labor Party does care about the economy, and if it does care about households, support us in getting rid of the carbon tax.

  That is just a false assertion based on a false assertion. And what a surprise! Because I remember the member for Lilley standing at this dispatch box on budget night and announcing that he was going to deliver four surpluses in a row - four surpluses in a row! And the member for Lilley - God bless him! He is my best friend over there; we need more of him - went out last night and said, 'Look, I would have delivered a surplus if only we were re-elected - if only we were re-elected! - Give me another chance,' the member for Lilley said.                 Oh, come on - do me a favour here, I am just getting going -                      I tell you what, Madam Speaker, there is a real Minister for Immigration sitting there! But I remember you as Minister for Immigration!                     The boats - there were more boats coming in than there were planes at Sydney Airport!                     And I remember him over there as the Minister the Immigration!                     He should not be so precious. He should be proud of his record as Minister for Immigration, because they certainly came in! And the member for Watson, to address him by his proper title; he was another great Minister for Immigration.                     But I tell you what, as the boats came in under them the boats stopped under this Minister for Immigration. The boats stopped, and not only that; because the boats have stopped we have saved the budget $2Â½ billion and we have closed nine detention centres. But most of all, as a result of the actions of this government there are no children floating in the ocean between Australia and East Timor as occurred under Labor!                     I am happy to talk about records. This Minister for Immigration has stopped the boats, and he has stopped the deaths at sea -                      We are proud of the policies that have actually prevented people from dying at sea when trying to get to Australia. And in the interim, he has saved the budget $2Â½ billion and we have closed nine detention centres. And in the interim we have got on with the job of fixing the mess they left behind.                     We have fixed up the mess. It is not just - and I know this is embarrassing for Labor, but I say to you - that we do not fix up the mess just where it lies in the budget; we have to fix up the mess in every other policy area.                     From the NBN, to immigration through to welfare, health and education - we will clean up all the mess that Labor left behind in every single policy area.

  I thank the member for Barker for his question. I can confirm that the Australian government will deliver an affordable, responsible and sustainable aid budget and that while Labor is continuing to make unaffordable, irresponsible and unsustainable commitments, this government will focus on the quality of our investment in developing countries in our region.                 We are focusing on results for our aid budget, and we will not be misleading the Australian public into making announcements, as Labor did, of an additional $5.7 billion to the aid budget which they then withdrew from the forward estimates. We will not be ripping $740 million out of the aid budget to plug a hole in the onshore processing costs as a result of their loss of control of the borders, making the Labor Party itself the third largest recipient of Australian foreign aid. Our priorities will include alleviating poverty through economic development, through public private partnerships leveraging the private sector and through the economic empowerment of women.                 We are increasing the humanitarian aspects in the budget. In fact, over the weekend I was able to announce an increase of $100 million to the eradicate polio program across our region because we have put sustainability back into the aid budget.                     We are also increasing the emergency fund that Labor had ripped money out of to fill black holes elsewhere in the budget. We have restored the emergency fund so we can respond to natural disasters.                 But it seems that Labor have learned nothing from the debt and deficit legacy that they left us. They have committed to increasing the aid budget by $16 billion. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: where do they think they are going to get an additional $16 billion from when we were already borrowing a billion dollars a month just to pay the interest on their debt?                 As the former Foreign Minister Bob Carr revealed in his travel log -                      the member for Lilley confessed that the financial situation under Labor was ruinous - and he was absolutely right. But you could not rely on much else that Bob Carr said because, as the member for Holt reminded us in the Financial Review on 11 April:                 If you ever wanted an example of the narcissism, self indulgence and immaturity that ran through the Labor party during its six years in government, Bob Carr is it.                 Well, Bob Carr got one thing right: you cannot fund the aid budget on borrowings. We will deliver an affordable, responsible, sustainable aid budget.

  Not at all. The legacy left by the member for McMahon was 92 announced but unlegislated taxation changes - he did not break the tonne. You think he should be proud of his record. On his website he does not even refer to the fact that he was Treasurer. I would be blanking it out as well. It is the modern equivalent of liquid paper.                 The fact is, of those 92, including the ones announced by the member for Lilley in last year's budget, Treasury provided advice that they simply could not be legislated. They did not know how to actually draft the legislation because the policy intent came out of the then Treasurer's office without any capacity to actually draft the changes to the taxation laws to get the money that they claimed they were going to get. There were 92 announced but unlegislated taxation changes. In relation to what he claims to be companies moving money offshore, the fact is, again, the advice was that Treasury could not deliver the policy intent because the legislation was going to be drafted with massive unintended consequences for Australian companies that wanted to expand offshore.                 We want Australian companies to expand offshore. We want them to be more profitable and successful in the global market place. It came down to the fact that the Labor Party did not understand taxation policy. That is why they had eight different versions of the mining tax, a mining tax that was just 97 per cent short of original revenue estimations, a mining tax that actually hits a new benchmark in taxation policy - not even the Greeks got there - in announcing a tax that raises no money. But the Labor Party did and that is what we were left with.                 The legacy of the pre-election fiscal outlook is there are all these spiders buried in the closets around Canberra. Why? Because Labor did not have any policy; they did not understand how to govern. And that was reflected in the fact that they were constantly changing leaders, they were constantly changing ministers and they were constantly changing policies.                 I say again, we were elected to clean up the mess that Labor left and we are going to do it.

  I thank the member for Lyons for his question. I can tell him the government is proposing far-reaching reform of higher education in Australia. Because of Labor's failure to arrest the decline in the higher education sector over the six years of their -                      government, this government is reforming higher education so that young people from all walks of life will get the opportunity to go to university, the same opportunity that I had to go to university. I am asked about fairly sharing the cost of education between taxpayers and students.                     At the moment, 60 per cent of Australians do not have a university degree yet they are asked to pay 60 per cent of the cost of the tuition fees for students at university. Those self-same students will go on to earn a million dollars more than those people over a lifetime, on average. So they are getting a very generous arrangement from the Australian taxpayer.                 Â                  Our reforms will mean that, on a $30,000 HELP debt - if it rises that high - graduates will be asked to pay $3 more per week for one extra year to repay their HELP debt. If they have a HELP debt of $40,000 - and remember, the current average is $16,800 - we are going to ask them to pay $5 more a week for two years to pay off that debt.                 Most people would regard that as a very fair exchange, when you consider that those students will go on to earn a million dollars more than Australians without a university degree over their lifetime, on average. The point was made well by our old friend the member for Fraser - and he is holding up a book -                      It is not the book I was about to quote from. I was going to quote from Imagining Australia - but he would have to share the royalties with the other authors of Imagining Australia, which is why he is holding up his own book, Battlers and Billionaires. He said:                  A deregulated or market-based HECS will make the student contribution system fairer, because the fees students pay will more closely approximate the value they receive through future earnings.                  He is absolutely right. But why is it that the member for Fraser knows this but the rest of the Labor Party does not? I lit upon it the other day.                 The Hawke-Keating government of the eighties understood that economic credibility is central to being in government - we understand it - Hawke and Keating understood that if Labor was to govern for any length of time they had to have economic credibility. And the member for Fraser is the only one who shares that legacy. Everyone else in the Labor Party, all the trade union hacks on the other side, think that economic credibility does not matter; they have shredded it in their response to this budget and the public will never vote for them until they get it back.

  I am delighted to take this question from the member from the other side. I have not done a study of the frontbench of the government to discover which universities they went to or which ones paid HECS; nor have I done so for the frontbench of the Labor Caucus.                  But I can tell the member that, if she wants to go back and discover who it was that decided that free education was not working - and was not bringing low-SES students into universities but simply subsidising the middle classes and the upper-middle classes - she should look no further than the former Prime Minister and Treasurer Paul Keating. He said at the opening of the Victoria University of Technology, Sunbury campus:                 There is no such thing, of course, as 'free' education - somebody has to pay.                  _ _ _                  _ a 'free' higher education system is one paid for by the taxes of all, the majority of whom haven't had the privilege of a university education. Ask yourself if you think that is a fair thing.                 That is what Paul Keating said.                  The member's question gives me the opportunity to point out how far the current modern Labor Party has moved from the Hawke-Keating legacy, and to repeat the point that I made in the previous answer and question: the current Labor Party has shredded their economic credibility. Most Labor figures of the past realised that so-called free education did not have any impact on bringing students into university.                      We have a modern day example that the member for Fraser would have studied. In the United Kingdom there is free education in Scotland and there is a deregulated education market in England. As the member for Fraser knows, since deregulation in England the number of students from low-SES backgrounds is at record levels. The number of students from low-SES backgrounds has ballooned in England; in Scotland there was been no change whatsoever since free education was introduced.                  So we are absolutely committed to our higher education reforms, because to us it is an equity measure; it is an equity reform. It will give more young people from low-SES backgrounds the opportunity that I had, and that so many members of this House had, to go to university and get the chance to increase their earning capacity over a lifetime. I am not going to slam the door behind me after I got a great university education, and nobody in the Labor Party should either. Get off your Green-Left agenda and start standing up for students from low-SES backgrounds, like I am.

  I thank the member for Hughes, my good friend and colleague from the Shire. I also want to thank the Treasurer for his comments regarding our performance in the border protection portfolio. The Treasurer and I have many things in common, and one thing we have in common is backbone. The backbone you have seen displayed on our borders is the same backbone this Treasurer has put into the budget. That is in stark contrast to what we saw from those opposite.                  I can update the House. It will come as no surprise to the House, I am sure, that since my update yesterday there have still been no successful people-smuggling ventures to Australia, and we are now in our sixth successive month of that being the case.                  But it was not always thus. I am glad the Treasurer saw fit to reference the performance of the member for Watson and the performance of the member for McMahon - and I could even go to the member for Gorton - when it comes to backbone, or lack thereof, and their performance on the borders. I will remind the House. When the member for Watson was Minister for Immigration, 68 boats turned up - a total of 5,358 people. And he was only there for a couple of months! When the member for Gorton was Minister for Immigration, 183 boats turned up - a total of 12,386 people. That is what happened under the member for Gorton.                     Under the member for McMahon, 398 boats arrived.                   The member for Corio then left the chamber -                      Madam Speaker, I am reminding the House about the record of the member for McMahon when he was the Minister for Immigration - 398 vessels and 24,447 arrivals. What we will see from the member for McMahon if he were ever to become the Treasurer again is the same backbone that he showed in immigration he would apply to the budget. That is what we are seeing in his response to this budget.                 I can update the House that it is true that $2Â½ billion is the saving in this budget from our successful border protection policies. At the last election, those opposite were forecasting 33,000 arrivals over the budget and forward estimates based on their current policies at the election - enough to fill Simonds Stadium, which is the home stadium of the member for Corio. That would have cost this budget $7 billion. Our border protection policies are working for Australia and the Treasurer's budget is working for Australia - and that is how it will remain.

  I am happy to answer the question. He asked what the problem is. The problem is Labor. It is Labor that delivered the five biggest deficits ever. It is Labor that has delivered a national debt that will take us generations to repay. And it is Labor that delivered for Queensland an $80 billion debt that Premier Newman and his colleagues have had to try to address. He is doing that through his budget. Through his budget he is trying to restore some balance in Queensland.                 He also inherited a horrible legacy from having followed a Labor government - a Labor government of waste; a Labor government that had actually left schools so dilapidated that many of them had not been painted during the whole time that Labor was in office. Labor had left the people of Queensland an enormous debt, and that is on top of the debt that Queenslanders have to share with other Australians when it comes to our current debt.                 When it comes to expenditure on hospitals and on education, let me repeat the self-evident point. Total funding on schools from this government increases by eight per cent this year, eight per cent the following year, eight per cent the year after that and six per cent the following year. When it comes to health, it increases by nine per cent this year, nine per cent the following year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent the year after that. Total Commonwealth funding to Queensland amounts to $96 billion. Indeed, Queensland will receive $53 billion from GST share, and that is $2.2 billion more than was anticipated in MYEFO. So the Commonwealth is providing significant funds to Queensland and to other states.                 Let me say by way of observation that, while I quoted nine per cent increases for health and eight per cent increases for education, those are national figures. Queensland figures are actually better than that. They are actually going to get more money than that. So that helps Queensland to try to address the problems Labor left behind - Labor's problems that Premier Newman in his budget has to address and which he is manfully seeking to do. I congratulate him on the work that has been done to rebuild Queensland - a task that we are also setting about nationally.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. The government is committed to ensuring the NBN is delivered quickly, cost-effectively, at least cost to taxpayers and affordably for consumers, and we are going about this in a businesslike way. We are conducting now a thorough cost-benefit analysis, being dealt with by an independent panel headed by Dr Mike Vertigan. It will report in the middle of the year and that will inform the roll out of the project. That is in marked distinction to the Labor Party who, as we know, committed to a single access technology - fibre to the premises - without any cost-benefit analysis, all done on the back of a beer coaster on a VIP flight from Sydney to Brisbane.                 We know that a Conrovian fog has fallen over the Labor Party which prevents them from acting in a rational economic manner. It causes them to deny the budget realities, the consequences of their wastefulness, the $667 billion of debt we are headed to without any change. But the fog sometimes breaks. I say with respect to the honourable member that I come not to embarrass the member for Fraser but to praise him, for I am very concerned, as we all are, that the Conrovian nonsense he is forced to spew out occasionally nowadays will live after him, but the wisdom and economic rationality will be buried in his bones, unless we draw people's attention to it. You can imagine the thought reform that the member for Fraser has had to have. You can imagine the Conrovian electrodes going onto him, as they give him another jolt to stop him being rational. You can imagine him coming out of the bunker shaking and spouting nonsense about 'no budget crisis and everything is okay'. Imagine the electricity bill of that exercise; imagine the carbon emissions.                  It is extraordinarily wasteful but every now and then you see that it is very hard to cause somebody who is highly intelligent to be stupid all of the time. It really is. Even the Labor Party is unable to do that. We know they regret it. They must always be saying, 'If only we'd got him from the AWU, not the ANU!' Only a couple of weeks ago he said on the radio here in Canberra, talking about the budget:                 I think infrastructure is a good thing, but I do see a risk that they are returning to the old pork-barrelling model in which you do not do proper cost-benefit analysis. What model was that? That was the Conrovian model. I can understand him being apprehensive. If I hung around with the people he does, I would be very worried about that sort of thing.

 In response to the Leader of the Opposition, let me say the Nationals will always support increases in education expenditure, increases in health expenditure, increases in infrastructure expenditure and increases in rural and regional infrastructure expenditure.                     The reality is this budget delivers for all Australians                      I am sure Minister Piccoli will welcome in his own budget the fact that there is an eight per cent increase in education funding this year, eight per cent the following year and eight per cent the year thereafter. That will enable him and the education department of New South Wales to provide services right across New South Wales and to provide the special assistance that is necessary in those schools that need extra help.                     The Leader of the Opposition simply has to face up to the fact that this government is providing an eight per cent increase in education expenditure this year and eight per cent the following, and eight per cent the following year. That will benefit the students of New South Wales and, indeed, every other state.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. He has taken quite an interest in the history of the co-payment. For 50 years the  Labor Party has supported a co-payment, right up until this budget. We have recognised that Bob Hawke was the father of the co-payment -                      when it came to Medicare because, like this government, Bob Hawke wanted to make sure that Medicare was sustainable, particularly, given an ageing population -                      all of the costs that would be coming down the  line over the course of the coming decades. We want to have a strong Medicare system and that is why we have proposed a co-payment. We know, as I say, that Bob Hawke was the father of the co-payment, we know that Jenny Macklin was the head of the unit that provided advice to Mr Brian Howe, who obviously then went on to implement a co-payment. So we know that Jenny is the mother of the Medicare co-payment and we know that the son of the co-payment is here in the member for Fraser.                 Â                      We know that the member for Fraser -                      I want the parents to be proud of the son. I want them to be proud of the member for Fraser. They have had him in hiding for a couple of weeks now. Normally you could not get in between him and a camera, but they have hidden him for a couple of weeks. They have reduced him to some sort of IMAX, where he is holding up his book. Let me quote from the book. He says:                 As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doctor - and the idea is hardly radical.                 As it turns out, when we look at this family tree, there are another couple of people that we need to out today. The member for Lingiari voted for a co-payment in 1991. And we know that the member for Werriwa, the overachiever in the Ferguson family, voted for a co-payment as well. Good on him, because he wanted to make Medicare sustainable. We all want to make Medicare sustainable.                 I can tell you, it must have been a torturous process for the member for Jagajaga over the course of the last 22 years and nine months, because she has kept this dark secret. She has kept a dark secret for all of that time. Not once can I find, over 23 years, the member for Jagajaga saying that she was opposed to the co-payment that Brian Howe introduced. This is the opportunity in this budget.                     What we seek to do in this budget is to make Medicare sustainable. We introduced the co-payment, $5 of which goes into the Medical Research Future Fund, $2 of which goes into doctors' pockets so that we can help supplement the money that they get from Medicare now, so that we keep bulk billing. We cannot afford Labor's model of giving everything to everybody for free and racking it up on the credit card. Bob Hawke knew it. Jenny Macklin knows it. The member for Fraser knows it. So do the member for Werriwa and many others.

  The assertions made by the Leader of the Opposition and the report on the ABC are simply wrong.                      The coalition is strong. It is based on an atmosphere of trust and reliance on one another. It has been strong for 65 years. For 65 years we have worked together to build a better country.                     We have so often -                      So often coalition governments have been called upon to fix up the mess left by Labor. That is what we are doing collectively as a team again now. We have to collect up, to pick up, the pieces that Labor have scattered across the nation and build a strong economy. That is what we are doing as a cooperative, close-working team. We are strong. We are getting on with the job and we will be delivering better outcomes for all Australians.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. He would know that every family has to live within its means. Every family has to have a budget that balances. If they spend more on one thing, they have to save money somewhere else. That is true also of governments. If governments spend money on one thing or if they spend more than they have got then somehow or other they have to find a way to make that up. Of course, Labor just spent and spent, wasted and wasted, and did little or nothing to make up for their waste. They left a legacy of debt for this government to pick up. So much of their disastrous expenditure programs - their roof insulation scheme, the National Broadband Network, overpriced school halls - was waste -                      This was waste that Labor inflicted upon the Australian people and have left for future generations to repay. But they have not yet learnt the lesson.                  In just 26 days time the carbon tax will be increased again. The carbon tax will go up. This $550 a year burden on every family will go up again on 1 July, from $24.15 to $25.40. The world's biggest carbon tax will become even bigger. Labor are fighting tooth and nail to keep this tax and to keep it growing. They want to continue to place this burden on Australian families and help make business in this country less profitable - there will be less opportunity for Australians to achieve their potential. Labor are determined to make sure that this carbon tax continues to go up. If they were still in office, they would be legislating this week to extend the carbon tax to road transport. That was a part of their commitment. They went to the election promising to extend the carbon tax to road transport.                     a tax of course that particularly affects people in regional Australia. The hypocrisy of Labor to be pretending that they are concerned about regional Australia while they are still committed to imposing a carbon tax on transport and raising the cost of living for everyone who lives outside capital cities! That is the kind of government that Labor were. They have not changed. They have not repented. They still want higher taxes for Australians and greater costs of living.                 Â

  There is a threat to the diesel fuel rebate and there is a threat of higher taxes on diesel and the transport industry, and that threat is Labor. Labor remain committed to imposing a carbon tax on transport fuel. They remain committed to legislating to put a carbon tax on transport fuel - a tax of 7c a litre. Labor would like to add 7c a litre to the cost of fuel to take goods and produce in and out of the country. Labor, your plans are for higher taxes. This government is delivering a budget which not only sets our country on the path to economic prosperity but also implements some substantial expenditure programs which will benefit regional Australia.                     The budget that is before the Australian parliament at the present time includes significant measures of particular benefit to regional Australia.                     They include a $50 billion infrastructure program; Building the Roads of the 21st Century; highways in regional Australia; substantial expenditure on the Roads to Recovery program; new bridges to be built in regional Australia and in other places; and $100 million for rural research. There are substantial benefits being provided for schools and for hospitals in regional communities, as the funding for these areas ensures the continuation of services outside the capital city.                 The government was left with a very, very difficult budget, and we have put together a program and an agenda which delivers for all Australians, including those who live in regional areas. The Nationals are proud to stand with a budget that delivers for regional Australians, as it delivers for all Australians - a budget that will deliver good outcomes for our nation in the years ahead.

  I thank the honourable member for Reid for question and note that he is asking a question about the details of the budget - and we welcome that. As someone who has worked in business and has been at the coalface of business activity, particularly in Western Sydney, he knows how important it is for the country to live within its means, as it is important for business and individuals to live within their means. Of course, under the trajectory that we inherited, of deficit and debt under Labor, we were facing $667 billion of debt within a decade. That is $25,000 for every man, woman and child in debt - government debt - in a decade's time, and we would be paying $3 billion a month interest - 70 of which would be going overseas. Just as we are paying a billion dollars a month interest now on the debt that Labor accrued, we now send $700 million of that each month to people overseas that we had borrowed money from. So it is money that leaves Australia every month.                 There is no sense of regret or even a sense of apology from our political opponents about this. The member for Lilley said that it was a 'ruinous' budget situation. In a moment of clarity in his discussions with Bob Carr he said the state of the budget 'is ruinous'. But, of course, now that they are in opposition they deny any responsibility. And no-one does that more than the member for Watson, who went out again this morning and said: 'We had to keep within our two per cent cap on spending growth that we put in place.'                     He said, 'We had to keep within our two per cent cap on spending growth.' The only problem is they did not. He said, 'We had to', but they did not. Of course, the year that he misses out on is the year when Labor increased spending by more than 10 per cent. They just went for the credit card. They smoked the Amex in just one year and then they said, 'We're do-gooders; don't worry. It is all okay.' But the problem was that the locked in 3.7 per cent in increasing expenditure over the next few years.                 The member for Watson is like this little dog that I got for the family before Christmas. In training the dog, I keep saying, 'Don't run out on the street into the traffic.' That is what the member for Watson keeps doing - he keeps going out into the traffic and then we have to pull him back and point out that it is, in fact, very dangerous for him to do that, because he gets his numbers wrong. Just as he got his numbers wrong on every single occasion in the past he keeps doing it. So my best advice is: stay off the road and out of the traffic.

  I am absolutely thrilled to answer the question because do you know what? I have been 260 days in this place and I have never been asked a question - never once! That is their attitude to agriculture. And the first question I am asked about agriculture is from the member for Sydney! And what is the question? You would think they would ask a question about how in May we had record movements of beef - over 108,000 tonnes of beef. You would think they would ask a question about moving 1.3 million head of live sheep and that, since we have signed off the Bahrain agreement, the price of sheep has gone up by $30 a head - an extra $12,000 per semi load or up to about $36,000 per semi load. But of course we did not get a question about that. You would think they would ask a question about the 585,000 head of cattle we have moved in the live cattle trade - something you were responsible for shutting down. But of course, no, we did not get a question about that. You would think we may have got a question about the drought package that we have rolled out with over $700 million of concessions, but of course we did not get a question about that. We got a question about a rumour!                 I have heard another rumour. Here's a rumour. I have heard that the member for Sydney wants the Leader of the Opposition's job. There's a rumour. Here's another rumour. I have heard that someone from the New South Wales Right got convicted by the ICAC for corruption. But hang on! That's not a rumour; that's the truth - Eddie Obeid. I heard another rumour that someone from the New South Wales Right also wants your job. Tony Burke wants your job. That is not a rumour either. I heard another rumour that the member for Lilley is still in the chamber.  No, it is the truth. He is still here.                  We hear lots of rumours around here but we never get any questions about policy - no questions about policy. I welcome it. After 260 days, they have finally decided that there is an agriculture portfolio but they just cannot work out how to ask a question about it.                 To go back to the diesel fuel rebate, it is your party that wants to put a tax of 6.85c a litre on diesel. So there is only one party to vote for if you want the tax: you!

  I thank the member for Robertson for that question. I know it is a hard to act to follow my good friend the member for New England, but I will give it my best shot because on this side of the parliament we are focussing on good economic policy and on the creation of jobs. That is why I am pleased that the Australian Taxation Office and a number of other government agencies are employing more than 600 people in Gosford. We are able to announce a new centre of excellence in Gosford on the Central Coast of New South Wales because we are absolutely committed to getting more jobs into more regional areas, as well as importantly helping to stimulate economic growth. The impressive fact is that in the first months of this year over 106,000 new jobs were created in Australia.                     'About time,' they say, and now they are fighting over who said it - 106,000.                     I will tell you: 79,000 full-time jobs out of 106,000; 79,000 full-time jobs in the first four months of this year. Under Labor, 200,000 more Australians were unemployed in just six years. The unemployment rate had a four in front of it when Labor was elected and it is going up to 6Â¼ per cent  as a result of the legacy of Labor. They do not care about jobs. They never cared about jobs. We are the party for job creation.                      We are the party for a prosperous economy - 106,000 new jobs in just four months. Is there any apology from the Leader of the Opposition about his behaviour at the beginning of this year? He said:                 How on earth can someone protest to be the worker's best friend, the best friend of wage-earning, tax-paying employees in Australia, when 63,000-plus full-time jobs have gone since they came into power?                  Well, 108,000 jobs have been created since we came into power, but we have lifted in the first four months of this year, as I said, in net terms, 106,000. The member for McMahon is looking down at his papers - and no wonder. He said:                 The jobs lost at SPC, Holden, Toyota or Ford are not being replaced with other jobs being created across the economy because we see the figures in net terms.                 There have been 106,000 net new jobs in just four months! That is our economic plan. That is our economic action strategy at work. I say to the Labor Party: get out of the way of our budget and there will be more jobs created.

  It is just Nirvana, isn't it - no questions, then two in a day! I was about to put a cutout of myself down there but this is incredible.                      The most amazing thing is that we talk about influence. I will tell you where most of the influence is. Most of the influence is in the union movement. I will tell you where there is real influence. We saw some influence today - Eddie Obeid. Now there is a man with real influence. Here is another one of influence - Ian Macdonald - another former colleague of yours with real influence. These people have real influence. Their influence has been proven by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, that said today that they are corrupt. And where do they come from? They come from the austere environment of the Australian Labor Party, New South Wales Division.                 The Australian people know that if they really do want an increase in the tax on diesel, then they must vote for the Labor Party, because they endorsed a 6.85c a litre increase in the price of diesel. That is correct, isn't it? We know it is correct because they stand by that policy. The reason they stand by that policy is because of their alliance with the Australian Greens. People have got to understand that the Greens and the Labor Party have this pact. Single-handedly, they were going to cool the planet, and one of the ways they were going to do it was by making everybody poorer with a 6.85c a litre tax. It is quite bizarre. On the day when Eddie Obeid has been declared by ICAC to be corrupt, that you start talking about who is influencing who.

  I thank the member for Solomon for her question. I know that she is deeply interested in the bilateral relationship with Indonesia and particularly the trade relationship that is so important to the Northern Territory. I can assure the member and the House that the relationship with Indonesia is a key priority of this government.                  Indeed, the Prime Minister's first overseas visit was to Indonesia and yesterday he met with President Yudhoyono, again, at the President's invitation, and I am assured by the foreign minister Dr Natalegawa, who contacted me this morning, that the meeting went well. The Prime Minister has reported that it was positive and constructive and I think that it is quite evident that there is a warmth and a rapport between the two leaders, the President and our Prime Minister.                 The Prime Minister and the President stressed the importance of the bilateral relationship and the need to broaden and deepen and diversify this relationship. Already there is a high level of engagement between Australia and Indonesia. Indeed, I have calculated that there are about 60 different areas of cooperation across 22 Australian government departments and agencies and our opposite number in Indonesia.                 I have met the foreign minister, Dr Natalegawa, on nine separate occasions since taking this office, one-on-one constructive, positive meetings. Senator Johnston, the Minister for Defence, and I will be shortly holding our two-plus-two meetings with our Indonesian counterparts. Ambassador Najib has returned to Canberra and we are initiating more activities to strengthen the relationship - a $15 million grant for an Australia-Indonesia Centre at Monash University. Indeed, the New Colombo Plan is seeing students studying in Indonesia as we speak. In fact, 40 per cent of the applicants for the second phase of the New Colombo Plan were to Indonesia, and I think that augurs well for the relationship.                 We are rebuilding confidence in the trade relationship with Indonesia and, as the Minister for Agriculture reminds me, about 230,000 head of cattle live have now been moved into Indonesia. We are reassuring Indonesia that we will not repeat Labor's ban because that went straight to the heart of food security.                 We are also cleaning up the mess left by Labor in terms of the people-smuggling trade. The Prime Minister assured President Yudhoyono that we will dismantle the people-smuggling trade, and the President said that Indonesia too was a victim of the people-smuggler trade. I think that it is worth remembering what Labor's Bob Carr said about this in his published travel diary. He said, 'I told Abbott if he won he'd have to take drastic action on people smuggling or the numbers would keep rising and crowd out our regular immigration program.' Bob Carr said, 'I told him, because we'd lost control of our borders.' That is what Bob Carr said. I want to acknowledge the work of the Minister for Immigration, who has stopped the people-smuggling trade and who has stopped the deaths at sea, because that is not in the interests of Australia or Indonesia for a people-smuggling trade to flourish as it did under the former Labor government.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and welcome him to the parliament!                     I think that is probably right. More than one day in a week is too much for the member for Kennedy, particularly since tomorrow is not a sitting day!                 The answer to the member's first question about when the Pentland irrigation baseload power station study will be released is next Tuesday, in Townsville. I am looking forward to being there for that release with the member for Herbert, the member for Leichhardt and others who have had a particular interest in that study and indeed in northern Australia.                 I might add that, on the same day, the green paper on northern Australia that we committed to during the last election campaign will also be released. That follows extensive meetings across Northern Australia with communities in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland; the meetings of the parliamentary committee under the leadership of the member for Leichhardt; and submissions and contributions from many people across the north.                 Like the honourable member, I am disappointed that a lot of the work that has been done on northern development in Australia has not seemed to progress too much over the last six years. I know that in areas where I was the minister a number of reports were done -                      and unfortunately they made no progress during the term of the previous government. However, we are committed to the north. We are committed to ensuring that northern Australia is able to achieve its potential. There are significant commitments in that area in the last federal budget. There is substantial expenditure on roads - the Bruce Highway, in the honourable member's electorate; the Barkly Highway; the Leichhardt; Roads to Recovery; the bridges program - all of which will be of significant benefit to the north. There is funding also for the Northern Territory, an extra $77 million for their highways, and of course in north-western Western Australia as well.                 We will be looking at the broader opportunities for development in northern Australia. I believe that northern Australia can play a bigger role in our national economy, and the coalition government is determined to make that happen.

  Proudly, the Deputy Prime Minister and I are implementing the biggest infrastructure program in Australia's history: $50 billion. We are implementing the program, which is $16 billion more than what the member for Grayndler would have implemented had he been re-elected last September. And thank goodness he was not, because what we on this side are trying to fix is not only an infrastructure deficit but a budget that was broken and was unsustainable. And we are fixing it.

  I was on this occasion, fortunately, Madam Speaker, in spite of my colleagues' exuberance behind me and across the chamber. I am very happy to get a question from the member for Mitchell about the government's higher education reforms because we are very proud of our higher education reforms. We are very proud that they will spread more opportunity to 80,000 young Australians to go to university, and we are very proud that they will give our universities in Australia the best chance possible to be their best selves and to compete with their overseas competitors, particularly in Asia.                 Good oppositions support governments that take on big reform. It is never easy when you take on big reform. Good governments do it because they know it is right, and good oppositions support governments that take on big reform. In the Hawke and Keating period, the Peacock-Howard oppositions often supported some of the big reforms that those governments did. When Kim Beazley was the Leader of the Opposition, it was not unknown for him to support some of the big reforms of the Howard and Costello government.                 Yesterday Michael Gallagher, the chief executive of the Group of Eight Universities, had this to say about our reforms. He said:                 The 2014 Higher Education Budget reforms are necessary.                     He said:                 They are logical, coherent, sustainable, equitable and inevitable.                 He also said:                 My guess is that the detractors of micro-economic reform in Australia's higher education industry will find themselves on the wrong side of history in resisting efficiency improvement and innovation, as they will be in opposing the redistributive measures of the package and, curiously, supporting socially regressive subsidies from general taxpayers to more advantaged segments of the community.                 Mr Gallagher is absolutely right. The opposition have found themselves on the wrong side of this reform, have found themselves opposing more young Australians being given the opportunity to go to university, have found themselves on the side of subsidising middle- and upper-middle-class families to go to university rather than doing what this side of the House is doing, which is trying to get young people with low SES, first-generation university goers, into university.                 The problem for this Leader of the Opposition is: he does not mind shredding Labor's economic credibility, such as it is - he does not mind shredding the economic credibility they had in the Hawke-Keating period - if it means political day-to-day tactics. We have seen it on display today. How obviously have we seen it today - question after question about rumours in this building, rather than asking questions about the budget. We are still asking questions about the budget on this side of the House, because we are pleased with what we are doing in this budget to try and change Australia for the better.                     The problem with that side of the House is: they are all tactics and no strategy; they are all politics and no policy; he is all froth and no beer.

  I thank the member very much for his sincere concern about, in particular, children with type 1 diabetes. In our country, sadly, we have about 100,000 Australians with type 1 diabetes. It is an insidious disease. I speak on behalf of people on both sides of the House when I say that we want to find a cure for type 1 diabetes. It is absolutely necessary that we do that. At the last election, the coalition promised $35 million to provide support to clinical trials to make sure that we could increase the research effort toward that cure. In this budget, we have built on that by wanting to get together a $20 billion medical research fund so that, over years, we could have the capital of that fund secured and the $1 billion in year in interest that would flow from that fund come back into medical research. That is incredibly important, not just for type 1 diabetes but for diseases of the brain, for dementia, for all of the cancers that we need to put more effort into in relation to research. It is incredibly important.                 It is the case that we inherited an enormous debt from Labor. We cannot afford to put $20 billion aside without making savings elsewhere. So, in an effort to make Medicare sustainable and stronger into the future, we have proposed a $7 co-payment. Of that $7, $5 will go into the Medical Research Future Fund so that we can help find the cures for type 1 diabetes and other important issues.                     The former health minister interjects. Of course, she was the mastermind of waste and mismanagement within the health portfolio, more so than any minister since Federation. Her contribution and her opposition to the amount of money that we put into medical research are well known, because in 2011 the Labor Party tried to rip $400 million out of medical research, and the medical research community in this country has never forgotten that the Labor Party tried to rip that money out of medical research.                 I want to make sure that not only can we put extra money into the Medical Research Future Fund but, of the $7, $2 will go to doctors in general practice so that we can continue to support - on top of the money that they get out of Medicare now - bulk-billing for those people who cannot afford the $7.                     It is important in relation to the PBS as well. For 50 years, the Labor Party - in government and in opposition - supported a co-payment to keep our medicine system sustainable. For 50 years they supported a co-payment, and yet, for political reasons, they oppose a co-payment to keep Medicare sustainable. With an ageing population, with the need to find these cures, the coalition will fix up Labor's mess and we will make sure that we have a health system that is world class for years to come.

  What I cannot get over about the Leader of the Opposition is his double standards. I know that he sets one rule for others -                      and Labor behave a different way themselves. When Labor were in government, it was quite acceptable for there to be a co-payment on pharmaceuticals. When Labor were in government, they were happy to send market signals that we needed to make sure that we could manage future demand in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.                     Over $30 was the market signal for people not on benefit cards, and even for those that were on benefit cards there was a $6 market signal. Why is it acceptable to pay $6 for a bottle of pills but $7 to visit a doctor is unacceptable? The Labor Party are so full of double standards that any commentary they want to make on health issues is simply not worth listening to. Their dishonesty, their unwillingness to accept the fact that what we have to do is make sure that our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is affordable in the future - that was a philosophy that they supported when they were in government.                     Now that they are in opposition, they do not think it is important to make sure that the Medicare scheme is sustainable. Now that they are in opposition they do not care about how we as a nation are going to manage to deal with our responsibilities to older Australians and those who are sick and disabled into the future. What we have is a budget plan that will help ensure -                      that health costs are sustainable for the future and that all Australians can expect to have the support from their government when they need it.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question and his ongoing interest in this topic, an interest that I have not seen shown by those opposite. I notice that the member for McMahon is very quiet today. It may have to do with the remembrances we had yesterday about the member for McMahon's performance when he was immigration minister, when he allowed in almost 25,000 arrivals and almost 400 boats on his watch.                 As we went over the member for McMahon's record as immigration minister, I saw that immigration twitch coming back into his shoulder as he recounted all of the experiences that he had when he was immigration minister. We know that the only person who was going to thank the member for McMahon for his performance as immigration minister was Captain Emad. Have you seen him lately? Have you heard from him? Has he sent his thanks?                 In relation to the question, I can say that we have reached another milestone from these strong policies and the strong resolve. It is 168 days, which is 24 weeks - a new milestone - since we have had our last successful people-smuggling venture. We have also passed a milestone: $2Â½ billion in savings for this budget. We have passed a milestone today. It is 100 days today since the shadow minister has asked me a question in this House when it comes to border protection - 168 days without a successful venture and 100 days without a question. With our successful policies, we are stopping the boats and we are stopping the questions from the opposition.                  But I am not surprised that the opposition cannot bring themselves to this dispatch box to ask us a question because, when you ask questions, you have to know what your own policy is. You have got to have the faintest idea about where you stand on issues. Because question time is question time.                     What we get every day from the opposition is 'whingeing time'. They come in here and they whinge, but they will not bring policy alternatives into this place. Whether it is on the budget, on the borders, you will not hear an alternative policy from those on the opposite side.                 Seventy-one per cent of Australians support the policies we are putting in place to stop the boats. The other 29 per cent sit on that side of the House, opposed to the policies that are stopping the boats. I have the same advice for the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition that I gave some time before: 'When you're looking for the border policies you should follow, don't look to the left, down to the Greens; don't look to the right for all the failed immigration ministers that litter your frontbench - look this way.' This is where effective border protection policy lives, with the coalition, and it has done so for more than a decade, you failures!

  I thank the honourable member for her question. I must say that I appreciate getting some questions on the NBN, because I never get them from the opposition. In fact, the only question the shadow minister for communications ever asked me was about a boat. In fact, they have asked the minister for immigration and me the same number of questions on boats - only one each, as far as I am aware.                 But the position is that, by taking on the fiscal realities of our nation, of not deluding ourselves, of recognising that we cannot keep on spending and spending and running up debt, this government is getting down to the business of repairing the budget and, as part of that, repairing the NBN. I can inform the House that, with the stabilisation of the rollout, with the new management, we are now in a position to provide more information and more certainty for people living in roll-out areas. Today, NBN Co is releasing information on around 70 new sites, covering 167,000 premises, where build preparation for the fibre rollout has begun. That means that people will soon see workers out in the street, clearing Telstra's ducts and pits ahead of the physical network being installed. In Dobell, around 7,200 premises are a step closer to getting access to the National Broadband Network, with build preparation work now underway in Bateau Bay, 4,800 premises, and in Long Jetty, Toowoon Bay and Blue Bay, about 2,400 premises.                 I can inform the honourable member that in her seat of Dobell the NBN has already passed 13,200 premises in brownfields or built-up areas. Just across the road from the honourable member's seat in the seat of Robertson we have fibre-to-the-node pilots underway in Umina, we already have 11 nodes in Umina and, as the NBN noted in a recent estimates hearing, we have signed an agreement to facilitate the access to the spare Telstra copper pairs there, meaning end-users can be signed up to services on a trial basis.                     We took the misleading information Labor had about the rollout off the maps because what Labor was doing was that Senator Conroy was putting green splotches everywhere, misleading people as to what was happening, giving people the impression that the NBN was about to come. It was a hopelessly disappointing exercise. So what we are now doing is putting reliable, accurate information about the project that people can trust on the NBN Co's maps. I have referred honourable members to it and I can say once again that we are committed to complete the rollout sooner, cheaper and more affordably, to the great benefit of all Australians and the repair of the budget.

  I never shrink from an opportunity - to remind the Labor Party of the mess that they left this country in. The fact is the great failure of responsibility on the Leader of the Opposition's part. What a reckless man, what a hollow man.                      What a hollow opposition full of complaints. What do they offer us: $667 billion of debt. That is what I am reminding people about and we are all reminding people about every day we speak. Had we stuck with your budget, with your plans, this country would sink deeper and deeper into debt. You had no solutions. The Treasurer produces a budget: do you have any alternative plans? Just heckling, just catcalling. What a tragic mob you are. No ideas. They say they do not like cuts. He has been very good with a knife in the past, quite the swordsman, but he is better at putting it into people's backs, isn't he? Always ready for the back cut.                     I could not believe the member for Grayndler saying he had not heard anything in defence of the budget. I do not blame him. He has probably got hearing difficulties and all his colleagues shouting and screaming. This is the whole point. This is the message we are all committed to and the single fact of the matter is this: you, the opposition, you, the Labor Party, left this budget in a shocking mess. You were spending more than you were earning and something had to be done.                     Yes, it is a tough budget. We know it is not popular. We picked that up, we know that. But do you know something: the alternative is this. The alternative is piling up debt, and what a weak and pathetic opposition that has no alternative budget, the first opposition leader in my time in this parliament that could not produce an alternative budget on the budget-in-reply.                     Just one long whinge and that is the best they can do. What a hopeless opposition. They used to call the opposition the alternative government. Not anymore, no.                     You could not regard this mob as an alternative. They are just a whingeing, whining, complaining bunch of political screamers. One of the members is often calling me a liar here. One minute I thought she was calling me a lawyer, which, while true, is nonetheless a low blow. But the fact is that we are taking on the reality of the financial condition you left us. We are cleaning up your mess.

  I thank the honourable member for his question, a person who serve the people of Maranoa long and well.                     I lived in the seat of Maranoa. If I was you guys I would just listen. You have an absolute shocker of a day: two questions ruled out of order, another two questions given to you out of charity. On a very serious issue. We have to make sure that we look after people and carry them along. To the member for Maranoa, we have had two tranches of drought policy. The first was in December last year, where we managed to get the farm finance package signed off, because the previous government had not managed to complete it, and then reallocate that money in such a form that it was more associated with drought. We also put $10 million towards water reticulation. As you are well aware, more watering points give a greater coverage for the pasture.                 Earlier this year, we took through a $320 million package through cabinet to look after those people in the crisis of drought. Within that is included $10 million for pest eradication. I know you are very aware of the wild dog population. And I am sure there are many people on the other side aware of the wild dog population as well!                 As well, there is a policy for mental health. We also dealt with issues to make sure that people have capacity to get affordable money. I am happy that the ABA have come out today and said that they are trying to match our rates. It is bringing in competition and that is also good. So we are starting to get effects away from the policy. With this, we have signed off everything. I would like to thank the Treasurer and the finance minister for the work that they have done in making sure that the package does not go back down to lines on a map. That is incredibly important and I am sure you are aware of that.                  Away from that, I am sure the member for Maranoa is aware of the work that we are doing, especially in the sheep field. I know that sheep are so important in the western districts of the Maranoa. He would be aware that since we have opened the Bahrain trade, the price of sheep have gone up by $30 a head in the yards, which is a great return.                     Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, but I would like to address the interjection because on this side we do actually understand the policy - and he should listen, this is called 'policy'. The tranches of money that we have made available out of the $420 million for New South Wales and Queensland are fully drawn. We have moved them all, because that is what we are - we are effective. The Labor Party could not even get them signed off with the states. They could not even finish the deal. We have also opened up the Egyptian trade. We now have the health protocols through for the Iranian trade. We are in negotiations with the Saudi trade. Compared to that side, we have a 19.3 per cent increase on their record for the first quarter with $10Â½ billion worth of agricultural products moved in the March quarter.

  I do thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. There is a serious and deteriorating situation in Iraq. A radical Islamist group - a group so extreme that it is a splinter group from al-Qaeda - originating in Syria, has now made major advances across wide swathes of Iraq.                 This is a very concerning development. It seems that this group has proceeded through Iraq with maximum violence and terror to the civilian population and has behaved with extraordinary brutality towards surrendering Iraqi soldiers and policemen. There are reports that the Iraqi security forces have rallied somewhat, but at the moment those reports are sketchy.                 This is a very, very concerning situation. As things stand, it is a humanitarian disaster for the people of those sections of Iraq which have now fallen under the control of this group. Should the control of this group be consolidated, we are faced with the situation of a terrorist state - a terrorist state with considerable sway over parts of a quite sophisticated country. Not only is it a humanitarian disaster for the people of those sections of Iraq but also it is a security disaster for the Middle East and also for the wider world.                 As you would expect, there was discussion between myself, and members of my party, and senior figures in the United States. It is, as you would expect, the sort of thing that is natural between two very, very close allies. The United States is weighing its options. It is considering the situation, and consultations between Australia and the United States will continue. This is a serious situation. No-one should underestimate the difficulty that this development poses to the people of Iraq, to the people of the Middle East and ultimately to the people of the whole world.

  I thank the member for Petrie for his question. He is right: the government has said we are in the business of building a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. In particular, pre-election, the government said that we would stop the boats, we would scrap the carbon tax, we would build the roads of the 21st century and we would get the budget back under control. That is what we said we would do and since the election we have been purposefully setting about doing just that.                 For almost six months, there have been no successful people-smuggling ventures -                      arrive in Australia. Within the next month or so the carbon tax should be abolished and that will save the average Australian household some $550 a year.                     This is the best thing we can do right now to reduce cost-of-living pressures on Australian families. Very soon, work will be underway on the major roads that the government committed to, pre-election, and, thanks to the recent budget, we are now back on track for sustainable surpluses. I regret to say that the former government gave us the six biggest deficits -                      in Australia's history. The former government gave us debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see. The policies of the former government would have given us $123 billion in cumulative deficits over the next four years and debt peaking at $667 billion. Because of the position the former government left our country in right now the Australian people, through the Commonwealth budget, are spending a billion dollars on interest alone every month.                     We are spending a billion dollars in interest alone every month. That is a billion dollars in dead money because of the spending spree of the former government. Thanks to this budget, we will be in a situation that is very close to balanced by 2017-18 and gross debt will be $300 billion less -                      than would have been the case under members opposite. It is not easy to repair the fiscal disaster - the debt-and-deficit disaster - that we have inherited from members opposite. We never said it would be easy. We did say it would be done and done it will be under this government.

  I do acknowledge the work that the cleaners of our country do and I particularly acknowledge the work that the cleaners around this building do -                      including Lucia, Anna, Maria and the other hardworking cleaners that do such an extraordinary job in cleaning our own offices.                     I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that no cleaner's pay is reduced. Every cleaner continues to be paid under the relevant industrial instrument and no cleaner in this country can be employed at other than the award or above. No-one can be employed at other than the award or above and the Leader of the Opposition should not go around this country scaring people. But that is the tragic pass to which members opposite have come: all they can do is scare. They have no solutions, just complaints, and the people of Australia are entitled to better from the Leader of the Opposition.

  I thank the honourable member for Dobell for her question. When local government is assembling in Canberra for their national convention -                      it is particularly relevant that we should talk about the impact of the carbon tax on councils right across the country. The example of Wyong Council, sadly, is repeated right across the nation. The carbon tax is impacting on councils, and therefore raising the cost of rates, right across the nation. At every level the councils are hit with carbon tax, in everything they do. There are a number of indirect costs, such as higher electricity costs, as a direct result of the carbon tax. Indeed, as I understand from Treasury modelling of the council's costs at Wyong, electricity costs are between $3.4 million and $4.2 million higher as a result of Labor's carbon tax.                 Then, of course, because Labor plans to increase the carbon tax every year, in just 15 days time all of those costs will go up. They will keep going up and up and up if Labor have their way. They want an increasing carbon tax to add more burden and more pain to Australia's ratepayers. It affects directly, also, those councils like Wyong that have a significant garbage disposal facility.                     The Buttonderry Waste Management Facility in that region is already having to pay the carbon tax because of the emissions it generates. As a result -                      the waste management rates in Wyong are $22 higher, already, than they ought to be as a result of Labor's carbon tax. And they will keep going up.                 Every time the council goes out to grade a road, or to build a new road, or even to mow the grass on the median strip, Labor's carbon tax is there adding to the costs of all those people who are involved. All those people are affected.                     I appreciate that the honourable member is embarrassed about the way in which Labor is imposing unnecessary costs on the ratepayers of Australia.                     If Labor had its way we would be debating in the parliament today legislation to spread the carbon tax's net to also cover road transport fuels, adding more and more to the imposition of costs that councils have to bear. The reality is we have been elected with a mandate to get rid of this tax, to get rid of this imposition on rates, to get rid of this cost on ratepayers. Labor should recognise that mandate, join us in the Senate to make sure that this tax is repealed and let local government get on with its job.

  The assertions in the Leader of the Opposition's question are simply untrue. They are simply false. The assertions claimed by the Leader of the Opposition are simply untrue. He can chatter away across the dispatch box, but all of the talk -                      All of the interjections from the Leader of the Opposition, who just cannot control himself sitting there, do not make his assertions true. No cleaner can be paid at other than the award or above. That is the simple truth. No cleaner in this country can be paid at other than the award or above. That is the truth, and nothing that this government has said changes that.

  I do thank the member for his question. I do look forward to working with him for the abolition of the carbon tax, and I do look forward to his support for the abolition of the carbon tax when the Senate changes in just a couple of weeks time. I want to assure the member that we will abolish the carbon tax, because I share his concerns about the impact of the carbon tax on the people of this country, particularly the impact of the carbon tax upon the people of Western Australia and Queensland. We will rescue them from this toxic tax. We will. We will absolutely rescue them from this carbon tax. We said we would scrap the carbon tax before the election. Even members opposite said that they were going to terminate the carbon tax. It is just that they said one thing before the election and did the opposite after the election - as always. So I am happy to say that the Leader -                      Let me conclude by assuring the member who asked the question that when it comes to the carbon tax it seems that he and I are on precisely the same page.

  I thank the honourable member for Banks for his question. It is the first sensible question from the member - from a member for Banks for a long time. You are a lot better than Daryl Melham. You are far more articulate. That is a very sensible question, and I say it is because, of course -                      He is a lot better than Daryl Melham, I will tell you, Joel. He has principles, this one. Now, I liked Daryl, but he went weak at the end. He went so weak with Labor. Fixing the budget is hugely important for Australia because, at the end of the day, we always have to fix up the Labor Party's problems, and they left us with $667 billion of debt. That means, if we do not address this issue, within 10 years we will have to spend $3 billion a month repaying the interest on Labor's debt. Seventy per cent of that goes to people living overseas because that is the group that we have had to borrow money from. So 70 per cent of that money goes to people overseas. As a result of our budget, we have reduced the potential debt by over $300 billion, and that is a significant step forward. However, there is so much more to be done, because, with all the measures that we have announced in the budget, we still do not get the budget back to surplus in the next four years. We still do not pay off Labor's debt over the next 10 years - the debt they racked up in just six years. We will not pay that off. With all the measures in the budget, we still do not get there. But the budget is a credible document that delivers. It delivers us savings that are absolutely necessary. Labor has no alternative.                  The head of the OECD has praised Australia for its budget. Angel Gurria said:                 _ they are dealing very directly and decisively with the budget deficit.                 He said:                 We're always saying you should at least keep it balanced. This is a more sustainable, more durable type of solution.                  He said that that means going for 80 per cent cuts and one-fifth tax increases.                 The OECD currently employs the former assistant treasurer of the Labor Party. Maybe he provided advice to Angel Gurria. And the OECD currently employs the former chief of staff to the member for Lilley. Maybe he provided that advice to Angel Gurria. I would say to you that it is common sense. The only way a government can live on a sustainable basis is to live within its means, today.

  Let me make two observations in response to the shadow Treasurer's question. First of all he is simply wrong when he talks about pensioners. Pensions go up every six months. They go up every six months; they went up in March by about $14 for a single pensioner. They will go up by roughly the same amount later in the year. Every six months pensions will increase.                  Yes, in 2017 the rate of indexation will be by CPI rather than by CPI or male total average weekly earnings. But what is wrong with indexing by the very index that members opposite, when they were in government, applied to family tax benefit? If it is wrong to index pensions by CPI, why did members opposite index the family tax benefit by CPI? How can it be wrong to index pensions by CPI, and right to index family tax benefit by CPI? - because that is exactly what members opposite did.                  We will fairly index pensions, and pensions will go up every six months. Members opposite should stop scaring the pensioners of Australia. They really should stop scaring the pensioners of Australia. As for paid parental leave, I am very proud to believe that, for the first time, the women of Australia should have access to a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme. I am very proud that we are responsible for what will be a watershed economic and social policy advance, because, unlike members opposite, we think that paid parental leave is a workplace entitlement. It is a workplace entitlement, not a welfare entitlement. We took it to the 2010 election, we took it to the 2013 election, and we will deliver it.

  The principle that the Leader of the Opposition is apparently supporting is that public servants should get a better deal than the people of Australia. The principle the Leader of the Opposition is apparently supporting is that his staff should get a paid parental leave scheme that pays them at their real wage but the people of Australia should not. That is what the Leader of the Opposition is saying.                     The Leader of the Opposition is saying that his staff should get a better scheme than the people of Australia. That is the real unfairness. What I am saying, what this government is saying, is that everyone should get access to paid parental leave at their wage, because this should be a workplace entitlement. I would have thought that members opposite, if they were fair dinkum about doing the right thing by the workers of Australia, would want to see people who were on parental leave paid at their real wage. If you get paid at your real wage when you go on holiday, if you get paid at your real wage when you get sick pay, if you get paid at your real wage when you take long-service leave, then surely you should get paid at your real wage on paid parental leave. The best way to ensure that this is properly funded is to make sure that the biggest companies in Australia pay it. I am very happy to get questions from the Leader of the Opposition on this subject; I really am, because this is an important social and economic reform and it will be delivered by this government.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question and I am pleased to report to both sides of the House that the Prime Minister's visit to the United States was an unqualified success and reaffirmed the excellent state of the bilateral relationship and the mutual commitment to the alliance.                     The Prime Minister and President Obama successfully concluded the Force Posture Agreement, which will govern arrangements for the US military presence in Australia, including the Marines rotating through Darwin. The Prime Minister also announced that Australia will establish a consulate in Houston within 12 months to strengthen our business and investment links, particularly in the energy and resources sector. Further, the Prime Minister co-authored an opinion piece with President Obama in the Los Angeles Times, which was republished in the Australian, on economic and security issues. For the benefit of the House, I table that opinion piece.                     In his meeting with President Obama the Prime Minister discussed a broad range of matters, including international and regional security issues and trade and economic issues, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, where trade minister Andrew Robb is doing such great work. They discussed the G20, and they discussed climate change. At the press conference following their meeting, President Obama said, 'We don't have a better friend in the world, as well as the Asia-Pacific region, than Australia'. Therefore, it was deeply disappointing to note that the success of the visit has caused obvious dismay among the ranks of the opposition, who were seeking to actively undermine the Prime Minister's visit and who were predicting conflict between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States. Labor was publicly wishing and hoping for the meeting between the two leaders to fail. That is tantamount to actively undermining Australia's national interest, because there is no more important personal relationship for this nation than the one between the Prime Minister of Australia and the President of the United States. Labor was desperately hoping that the cause of this confected conflict would be climate change, should it be raised. What hypocrites. I recall a meeting in 2007 when US President Bush visited Australia and met with then Labor leader Kevin Rudd.                   The member for Rankin then left the chamber -                      Reporting of that meeting shows that President Bush was shocked that climate change was not even raised, with a White House source saying, 'The Labor leader did not utter the words climate change'. What hypocrisy. Fortunately our strategic and economic relationship stands above the pettiness and lack of judgement of the Labor Party.

  I can only assume that should the current opposition ever come back into government that they would change the public service rules to prevent public servants from being paid at their wage when they take paid parental leave.                 The only conclusion we can draw from the repeated attacks by the opposition on the government's policy to ensure that the rest of the population get the same benefits that public servants get is that they want to take these benefits away from public servants. That is the only conclusion that can be drawn.                 This government's position is absolutely crystal clear: if it is right for public servants to go on paid parental leave at their wage, it is right for the workers of Australia to go on paid parental leave at their wage. And as for pensioners: well, if the member were fair dinkum about looking after pensioners she would vote to abolish the carbon tax. That is what she would do! If members opposite were fair dinkum about helping the families, the pensioners and the households of Australia they would do what they said they would do before the election and terminate the carbon tax.                 Of course, they love the carbon tax. They love the fact that the households of Australia are $550 a year worse off as a result of their carbon tax. This government will save the people of Australia from this carbon tax and deliver $550 a year that the people of Australia absolutely deserve.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question because he, like the rest of the government, wants to spread opportunity in higher education to 80,000 more young Australians over the next few years - at least 80,000 more - in stark contrast to the opposition. He, like most members of the government, want to give our universities the opportunity to excel and to compete with their Asian counterparts, who are coming at them all the time, in terms of quality and capacity to attract international students.                 Support for these reforms are coming from some likely sources but also some unlikely sources. We have had a lot of support from the Group of Eight Universities and the Regional Universities Network. We have had support from business leaders, like Michael Cheney in Western Australia, who strongly supported these reforms when he was in Canberra last sitting week. There is support from peak bodies, like the Australian Council for Private Education and Training. And, of course, from our old china plate, the member for Fraser, who continues to write and say excellent things about the government's higher education reform agenda, which is about spreading opportunity.                 But I was surprised at some unlikely sources that over the weekend supported our government's reforms. I would like to quote from the Financial Review today, where one person is saying:                 The extension of funding of sub-bachelor program's to TAFE SA and other registered higher education providers provides an opportunity for TAFE SA to access Commonwealth funding for its diploma and advanced diploma courses on an equal footing diploma courses on an equal footing with universities.                 It is a very sensible statement, and I was most surprised that it came from Gail Gago, the South Australian higher education minister in the state Labor government in South Australia.                 This is an unusual and rare sensible statement from the South Australian Labor government. But when they do say something sensible we should praise them for it, because they are quite right: we want to spread the benefit of higher education to at least 80,000 more students -                      in TAFEs and other private providers around Australia. And support is coming from the South Australian Labor government. No wonder the member for Port Adelaide left during my answer, because he would be embarrassed about that!                 But this support stands in stark contrast to Australia's No. 1 whinger, the Leader of the Opposition, who wrings his hands and who is the national complaints desk for every complaint in Australia. But there is a question that he has to answer: where is the money coming from?                     In the time left available to me, let me make it very clear: we recognise that Australia's No. 1 whinger does not support expanding opportunity to more Australians around the country. We know that this lightweight Leader of the Opposition does not support our reforms, but they will be passed and they will benefit Australians.

  Again, members of the opposition are spreading untruths. It is as simple as that. The member who asked the question has said something about pensions which is simply are true, because pensions will go up every six months of every year. Back in March, the single pension increased by $14 a fortnight. The married rate increased by, I think, $11 for each member of a married couple. Increases of this order will take place later this year, twice next year and twice the year after that. Every six months the pension goes up. What has happened is that the government will, over time, somewhat reduce the rate of growth - the reason being that we do need to address the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite left us.                  This is the problem. The problem is that we are paying $1 billion a month in interest - that is $1 billion in dead money - because of the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite left us. We have a plan to fix this; all Labor has is a complaint. Once upon at a time, we had serious people in the Labor Party. When the Labor Party was led by people like Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, they had some serious answers for our country. They were prepared to take some tough decisions to reform our nation and to help set up the prosperity of the future. I regret to say: how a mighty party has fallen. This government will do what is necessary to put our future on a sound and sustainable basis - because that is exactly what the people of Australia elected us to do. We will not shirk the task.

  I thank the member for Brisbane for her question and acknowledge the significant support she provides to the QIMR and many other medical research bodies within the electorate of Brisbane. It is true that, right around the country, we are blessed with a number of institutes and universities that house the best researchers in the world. Over the course of the last 12 months, we have provided about $750 million as a country to medical research. It is incredibly important that we increase that investment.                  In 2011 the then Treasurer, the member for Lilley, sought to take $400 million out of medical research. With young researchers around the country, we fought against that change and we made sure that we kept money in medical research. In the most recent budget, we said that we wanted to set up a $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. It is incredibly important - not just so that we can employ those young researchers to try to find better ways to deal with diseases and to find world-leading medicines but also so that we can export that expertise. It is of incredible medical benefit to our country, but the economic benefit is significant as well, including in states like South Australia, where the Prime Minister and I were only a couple of weeks ago. We talked to the young researchers at SAHMRI about how by 2022-23, out of this medical research fund, we can provide an additional billion dollars a year for medical research.                  It is important, as was pointed out by Simon McKeon. People will know that Simon McKeon was engaged by the Rudd and Gillard governments to do a report on medical research. He came up with the solution. In his report he very tellingly said that the cost of health care at the moment is unsustainable. The person - the independent expert - commissioned by the Labor Party came back to the Labor Party, while they were in government, and said that the way we were spending in health was unsustainable. Simon McKeon spoke at the National Press Club only last week. He said:                 _ I think quite correctly, that if we don't do anything to our broader health system, it is unsustainable _ I think it's going to be a good thing if 20-odd million Australians feel that they're actually directly part of the research effort by that payment _ It would be a tragedy if this fund did not happen, simply because the funding mechanism was not agreed to in Parliament.                  As the Prime Minister said before, former Prime Minister Hawke had the guts to stand up and say that we needed a co-payment in the PBS - a policy that the Labor Party supported for 50 years. Mr Hawke said at the time that the Medicare system was unsustainable without an equal co-payment being applied to the MBS. This government in this budget not only boosts the money for medical research but also provides support for a sustainable health system - and we stand by it.

  Every time members opposite make untrue statements, it is an opportunity for the government to repeat the truth. The truth is that pensions go up now, they will continue to go up in the future and they will always go up. They will always go up under this government. What will not continue to go up under this government is debt and deficit. The reason we needed to make the changes we have made in this budget is that, as things were - with the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite had bequeathed this nation - so much that we cherish, so much that we value and so much that makes us special as a country was becoming unsustainable. It was simply becoming unsustainable.                  When you are borrowing $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on Labor's borrowings, you have to make some tough decisions. That is what this government was elected to do. We have not shirked the tough decisions. We have done precisely what the people of Australia asked us to do - to put this country back onto a sustainable path to a surplus.

  I thank the member for Boothby for his question and recognise his strong and constant representation of the people in the southern suburbs of Adelaide since 1996. Part of that strong and constant representation has been for the pensioners in the electorate of Boothby. Can I inform both the member for Boothby and the members of the House that the pension will continue to rise twice a year under the Abbott government. Indeed, just three months ago, in March, the pension increased by $15.70 a fortnight for single pensioners and by $11.90 a fortnight for each member of a pensioner couple. And indeed, in three months hence, in September, the pensions will continue to go up again.                     I hear an interjection from another member from Adelaide -                      saying, 'What about 2017?' Well, I can inform him that in 2017 the pension will increase twice. Why don't you ask me another question? Come on in! Ask me another question!                     Pensioners are better off under this government because their pensions will continue to increase. Not only that -                      Madam Speaker, I can't even hear myself!                     Not only that; this government will maintain the energy supplement, which pays up to $361 per annum for single pensioners -                      and $546 per annum for pensioner couples. We will in fact keep the pensioner supplement, which currently is up to $1,635.40 for singles and $2,464.80 for pensioner couples - and that, too, will increase in September this year.                 If the Labor Party were not just feigning indignation, as they are in this chamber, then they could do something to help pensioners in Australia. What they could do is get out of the way and allow the repeal of the carbon tax, which would mean $550 on average to households in Australia. What nonsense is coming from the Labor Party.

  Yet again there are assertions in the question which are simply untrue. I ask the member who has asked the question to demonstrate where her claim is justified because there are no changes to carers as a result of the budget. We made commitments to carers, pre-election, and those commitments will be kept. They will be kept because this is a government which keeps its commitments. One of our commitments was to a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme -                      I say to the member who asked me the question: why does she think that her staff should have access to paid parental leave at their wage and not the rest of the people?                     I can understand why members opposite are touchy about this, because what they want is fundamentally unfair. They want one standard for public servants and a worse standard for the people of Australia.                     I think there should be one fair standard for all the people of Australia. If you go on paid parental leave you should be paid at your wage.                     The caterwauling from members opposite, the barrage of interjections from the Leader of the Opposition and others, demonstrate just how touchy they are, just how hypersensitive they are on this point. Why does the Leader of the Opposition think that his staff should be paid paid parental leave at their wage and not the rest of the people of Australia? If it is fair for public servants it is fair for the people of Australia.                     That is why we took this commitment to the 2010 election, we took it to the 2013 election and we will deliver on it, because the people of Australia deserve a fair system of paid parental leave.

  I thank the member for Wannon for his question. I can update the House that since we last met - surprise, there have been no further arrivals to Australia illegally by boat over that period, which means this week we are now approaching six months without any successful people-smuggling ventures - almost six months.                      That contrasts with the same period of time under the previous government, when 12Â½ thousand people turned up illegally by boat to this country. That does not surprise me, because at the election, in the forward estimates, they forecast 15,600 people to turn up over this term of parliament. That is how many they were forecasting. That is over 600 boats. They went to the last election promising 600 additional boats.                     No wonder the people of Australia threw them out. I can also inform the House that not only have Operation Sovereign Borders policies been effective in respect of stopping vessels coming to Australia, but in addition we have had people deciding to go back. We have passed a critical threshold, where more people now under this government, since the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders, have actually gone back than have come into Australia. More have gone back than have come into Australia under the policies of this government. There have been 1,111 arrivals that occurred in the first couple of months, but there have been 1,162 departures, be it voluntary or involuntary. That compares to over 50,000 people who turned up over the six years of the previous government and 1,600 or thereabouts departures.                   The member for Corio then left the chamber.                     I can understand that the member is sensitive. He is very sensitive to this government's record, because he should know - even though he is in denial - that the reason these results are being achieved is that the policies they said would never work are working. The policies they said would never work - whether it was turn-backs or temporary protection visas or any of these policies - are working. As a result, people are deciding not to come, and people who have come are deciding to go home under these policies. Interestingly, for those on bridging visas in the community since September last year 392 people have decided to go home. That compares to just 117 who had been on bridging visas for two years and decided to go home. What it says is that, when we came to government we said there would be no permanent visas for those waiting in the community for a visa. As a result, 392 already have decided to go home. That is more than three times what was occurring under the previous government. And they continue to oppose temporary protection visas.

  This government has not reduced the pay of any cleaner full stop, end of story. This government has not reduced the pay of any cleaner.                      The Leader of the Opposition, who cannot help interjecting, should stop telling untruths. He should stop telling untruths. And let me repeat yet again quite slowly for the Leader of the Opposition: no cleaner in this country -                      can be employed other than under an industrial award or agreement. No cleaner can be employed other than on the basis of the award or better. That is the simple truth now, it was the simple truth yesterday and it will be the simple truth tomorrow. The trouble with this Leader of the Opposition is that he is always trying to distort the truth. He is always trying to promote a scare. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has no solutions, just complaints.

  I particularly want to thank the member for Reid, who has a deep belief in the importance of fairness to his constituents. On that front, we have heard a great deal today from the very pious Leader of the Opposition and his team about fairness - an enormous amount about fairness. Well, we will offer you $550 a year worth of a fairness, and it is up to you to decide whether you want to share with the Australian people $550 a year worth of fairness.                 There have been some very interesting developments in relation to the carbon tax of late.                      Only three days ago the ACT regulator announced that if the carbon tax were repealed there would be two tariffs, one without the carbon tax and one with. Take the carbon tax away and electricity bills will drop by 11.6 per cent. I just want to repeat that for the House: in the ACT, electricity bills will drop by 11.6 per cent without a carbon tax. As the member for Reid points out, the New South Wales IPART regulator made an assessment about the difference between gas prices with and without a carbon tax - nothing hypothetical here, regulated prices, two tariffs, one with a carbon tax and one without. What is the difference? Up to 9.2 per cent lower prices for families without a carbon tax. It is not just New South Wales and it is not just the ACT; in Queensland, the Competition Authority also made an assessment. They made a regulatory determination that there would be a certain price with the carbon tax, take the carbon tax away and there would be a regulated decrease of, on average, eight per cent for Australian families living in Queensland - in other words, real reductions in the cost of living, on average, of $550 a year as determined by the regulators.                  The member asked, 'Who is standing in the way of repealing the carbon tax?' Until yesterday we had thought that it was the opposition, because, although they said before the election that they would terminate the carbon tax, afterwards they voted to keep it. Our friend the member for Port Adelaide sat there on Australian Agenda and - I just want to quote this - told the Australian people, 'We do support the abolition of the carbon tax.' Well, next week you will have the chance to vote for the abolition of the carbon tax in this House, in this place. So the message is very clear: if you believe in fairness, vote to abolish the carbon tax; and, if you believe in saving Australian families $550, get out of the way.

  I certainly want to see a more egalitarian society. Of course I want to see a more egalitarian society; we all want to see a more egalitarian society -                      This government has been in power for hardly nine months. Members opposite were in power for six years prior to that.                     The social problems that the Leader of the Opposition has discerned are problems that were created by his own government. That is the problem. This Leader of the Opposition has no plan for the future; he simply has a complaint.                  This government does have a plan. We have a plan for a stronger economy and the way to get a stronger economy is to get a stronger budget. This is a fundamentally fair budget. It is a budget where everyone is playing his or her part. Yes, the top three per cent of taxpayers will face a deficit levy. They will pay, as they should. Members of parliament will pay because there will be a pay freeze. Motorists will pay through fuel indexation excise. Everyone is doing his or her bit. This is a budget for our country. This is a budget for the long-term benefit of our country. This is the kind of budget that only a strong and committed government could deliver, but this is the budget that the Australian people elected us to bring down. We said we would fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster -                      and that is precisely what we are doing.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. As we learn every day through the budget debate, the funds available to governments from taxpayers are limited but the proposals for spending them are unlimited. It is the job of responsible governments such as ours to carefully weigh every item of expenditure and ensure that taxpayers are getting value. This is nowhere more important than in major infrastructure projects like the National Broadband Network.                 It is remarkable that when Labor was elected in 2007 their policy was that every major infrastructure project would be subject to a cost-benefit analysis, and then when it came to the NBN no such analysis was undertaken. Indeed, the former minister for communications, Senator Conroy, said at the time - rejecting the need for any such analysis, preferring the analysis of a beer coaster - 'We don't need any more studies, any more cost-benefit analyses, to know that this is an infrastructure investment this country is crying out for.' Stephen Colbert would be proud of that. That is 'truthiness' if you have ever seen it. The then finance minister Tanner said, 'We just formed the view that this is the outcome we are going to achieve come hell or high water.'                  We are used to the member for Fraser every now and then breaking out of the re-education camp and coming forth with some common sense. We know that he supports cost-benefit analyses, which, of course, is the government's commitment: every infrastructure project over $100 million will be subject to a cost-benefit analysis. But who would have imagined that we would see shortly a conversion worthy of Paul on the road to Damascus, Constantine at the Milvian Bridge, Shorten at the Hong Ho Vietnamese restaurant? It is an extraordinary conversion; an amazing conversion. As I was getting to sleep reading the Senate Notice Paper the other night, I noticed amendments proposed by those opposite to the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill -                      Astonishingly, the amendment requires Infrastructure Australia to undertake and publish a formal cost-benefit analysis. And who has this been moved by? Senator Conroy! Madam Speaker, has the logical acid from the member for Fraser -                      Has the acid logic of the member for Fraser seeped through the Conrovian crust? Is it re-adjusting the synapses? Are we going to see a flash of light from the senator?

  In response to the falsehoods of the Leader of the Opposition, I make two points.                     In response to the Leader of the Opposition's falsehoods I make two points. First, this government was elected to deal with the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite created. That is the first point I make. The second point I make is: when it comes to public hospitals, funding goes up nine per cent this year, nine per cent next year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent in the fourth year.                     In respect to public schools, funding goes up eight per cent this year, eight per cent next year, eight per cent the year after that and six per cent in the fourth year. Every single year, spending on health and education goes up. That is why the question from the Leader of the Opposition is just a farrago of falsehoods.

  I thank the member for McPherson for her question. Like everyone on this side of the House, she is very conscious of the promise we made to the people before the election: to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. If you want a stronger economy, you have to build a stronger budget and that is precisely what this government has delivered. Instead of debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see, instead of $120 billion of cumulative deficits, instead of debt peaking at $667 billion, this budget brings us back to balance within four years. This budget reduces debt by almost $300 billion. This is an honest budget. It does not fake up a surplus by cooking the books and fiddling the figures. Above all else, this budget addresses the problem of dead money - the one billion dollars in interest repayments every single month that this Commonwealth is paying because of the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite.                     If we did not have the billion dollars in dead money thanks to Labor's debt and deficit disaster we could, as the Leader of the House says, build the north-south corridor in just one month. If we did not have this dead interest money we could upgrade the Gateway Motorway in Brisbane in just one month. In six months we could rebuild the Bruce Highway and in a little over a month we could do the range crossing at Toowoomba. In a month we could rebuild Hobart hospital. I know the member for McPherson, as an engineer and chairman of the public works committee, wants to get these things built. They will be built so much more quickly when we are no longer paying off Labor's debt. This is a budget that tackles the problems that members opposite left us. This is a government with a plan to make our country strong.                     All we have from members opposite is a scare and a complaint with no solutions. You cannot trust Labor with national security and you cannot trust Labor with our nation's economy.

  Yet again, more falsehoods from members opposite.                     There are no cuts to pensions. Pensions go up every single six months; every six months pensions will increase. In March, pensions go up; in September, pensions go up.                     Every March and every September, pensions go up. The member for Hunter -                      should not run around this country scaring the pensioners of Australia. What this government is doing is making the pension sustainable. If there is one thing that threatened the sustainability of our pension system, it is the debt and deficit disaster which members opposite left us.                     When it comes to roads, I am very proud to say that this budget is the greatest road building budget in Australia's history. There are few things that are better for country Australia than new roads, and that is what the people of Australia will get in spades under this government.

  I thank the member for Bowman for the question. Our Economic Action Strategy is going to fix the federal budget, which was a terrible legacy from Labor: $667 billion of debt and $123 billion of forecast deficits. If we do not take remedial action, if we do not set about fixing the budget, then the interest bill alone in 10 years time is going to be $3 billion a month as a result of Labor's actions. Seventy per cent of that will be interest payments going to people living overseas, because they are the people that we have had to borrow from to fund the deficits that Labor created.                 Our Economic Action Strategy is not just about fixing our budget and it is not just about fixing the household budgets; it is also about fixing the state budgets, because it includes the fact that we are getting rid of that insidious carbon tax. That insidious carbon tax will go, under the coalition. As a result of the carbon tax going, the New South Wales government will save $237 million every year. Currently, the New South Wales government has to spend $237 million a year paying the carbon tax to Canberra. They will not have to pay that, so over four years, instead of paying that, they will have enough money to build a brand new full-service teaching hospital in the middle of New South Wales. That is what they get when they do not have to pay the carbon tax.                 In Queensland currently they are spending $148 million a year. They will get to keep the money from this year's carbon tax bill in Queensland and, instead of it coming to Canberra, they could build three new high schools - perhaps one in Townsville, perhaps one in Cairns or perhaps one in the member for Bowman's electorate. That is what they get for saving the payment on the carbon tax. The Victorian government pays $200 million a year on the carbon tax. That is the equivalent of four new high schools every year, or the equivalent of one year of carbon tax in Victoria could deliver payroll tax relief for 39,000 small businesses in Victoria. So that is the benefit that starts to flow through. In Western Australia it is $50 million a year, in the Northern Territory $20 million a year, in South Australia $10 million a year.                      The bottom line is this: if we want to fix the Federation, if we want to fix the tax system, if we want to fix household budgets, if we want to fix the federal budget and if we want to fix state budgets, then the Labor party has to get out of the way and support our repeal of the carbon tax.

  Let me repeat there are no cuts to pensions - none. There are no cuts to pensions. In March every year pensions go up; in September every year pensions go up. Every year. It is true that in 2017 the indexation rate changes. It is true that the indexation rate changes after the next election. What we are doing is applying to pensions the same indexation rate that the Labor Party applied to the family tax benefit. If the indexation rate is fair applying to the family tax benefit, then it is also fair applying to the pension. I want to make absolutely crystal clear to the pensioners of Australia that their pensions are safe with this government.

 I want the young people of Australia to get the best possible start in life. I have to say that no-one should start their adult life on social security. We want the young people of Australia to be either earning or learning and, thanks to the changes in this budget, the chances to learn are absolutely unprecedented. Thanks to the changes in this budget, there are more opportunities to learn than ever before. We will be making available Trade Support Loans to apprentices and we will be applying to non-degree courses the same kind of fee help that has long been available to people doing degrees. It is a fairer, better system as a result of the changes that this government has put in place under the budget.

  I thank the member for her question. This government is doing what we said we would do on our borders. We are doing exactly what we said we would do. The member for Corangamite, like every other member on this side of the House, can look their constituents in the eye and say, 'We said we would stop the boats, and that is exactly what we are doing.'                      We took to the election what we could do and we have achieved that to date. We will continue to achieve it by holding fast to the policies that we know work and that we have always believed would work. We will remain steadfast in our convictions to those policies. When those opposite go to their constituents and look them in the eye, their constituents will see one thing when it comes to border protection and that is failure. Because for six years that was the history and that was the form of -                      If he wants to ask me a question, Madam Speaker, he is welcome, but he just wants to shout shrill objections. Are you going to leave or are you going to ask me a question? Have some guts and ask me a question. The contrast could not be more stark. The only thing -                      The only thing that will be turned back by Labor, if they are ever to come to power again, would be the successful border protection policies of this government. How do we know that? It is their form - that is what they did last time and that is what they always do - because they do not believe in strong border protection policies. They were dragged kicking and screaming to offshore processing. We have not had a successful people smuggling venture in almost six months, and that has not happened by accident. It has happened as a result of conviction and belief in policies that we know work. Those opposite have had every position under the sun on border protection. They have been for turn backs; they have been opposed to turn backs. Kevin Rudd said he would turn boats back prior to the 2007 election -                  The member for Corio then left the chamber.                     but the promise did not even last until Christmas. They were for offshore processing; they have been against offshore processing. They have been for temporary protection visas and against them. People smugglers profited from the weakness of the previous government. If they were ever to occupy these benches again, the people smugglers would profit again, because Labor's weakness bears them out. Whatever their proclamations, or the division in their own ranks, the Labor Party will always be weak on border protection.

  Madam Speaker, there are no broken promises. There are no broken promises. We made it absolutely crystal clear pre-election that we were not committed to Labor's unsustainable pie-in-the-sky promises for the out years. We made it absolutely crystal clear that we were not committed. I have been asked about our budget and the New South Wales budget. Let me make it absolutely clear: as a result of this government's budget, total Commonwealth funding to New South Wales increases by $5.8 billion - $5.8 billion of increased funding as a result of our budget. Year on year, hospital funding grows by eight per cent, 10 per cent, 10 per cent and eight per cent. Year on year, schools funding grows by seven per cent, eight per cent, nine per cent and six per cent. This Commonwealth government is investing almost $15 billion to build the infrastructure of the 21st century for New South Wales. That includes $2.9 billion for our Western Sydney infrastructure plan; it includes $5.6 billion to complete the duplication of the Pacific Highway; it includes $1.5 billion plus a concessional loan of up to $2 billion for the WestConnex project. I applaud the budget that the New South Wales government has just brought down - I really do applaud it. I particularly applaud their emphasis on infrastructure. Let me say: this infrastructure Prime Minister is helping that infrastructure government to the right thing by the people of New South Wales.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he is as pleased as all regional members in Australia are about the $50 billion commitment that this government has made in the budget to road and rail infrastructure. It will make a real difference to our road network. There has been a lot of attention given to some of the major road projects that are being funded in this budget, but there is also significant investment in rail.                      How about the Port Botany rail? Is that urban? I would have thought it was in a sort of town. It is called 'Sydney'. This is a new rail link to connect the port at Botany to the intermodal to make sure that freight can move smoothly through Sydney. Of course, there is the North West rail project in Sydney - $690 million for that project. If the honourable members opposite are looking around for urban projects, how about the Moreton Bay Rail in Brisbane, which was announced by both the Labor Party and the coalition in the 2010 election? This will not be -                      The reality is that, yes, both Labor and the coalition promised this railway line in the 2010 election but it had to wait until we were elected to actually get started, to get built and underway. There are also commitments to the Advanced Train Management System between Port Augusta and Whyalla, the Melbourne metropolitan intermodal scheme and the $120 million to continue the upgrading of the Tasmanian rail system. I am sure the honourable member for Parkes will be particularly interested in one of the other flagship commitments in this budget, and that is $300 million towards the new Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail. We are getting on with the job - a project that Labor neglected during its time in office. We have put in place an implementation committee, and they are working on developing key initial projects that might well be able to begin promptly. They have identified three areas: the Rosewood to Kagaru section in Queensland, the Narrabri to North Star section in New South Wales and the Parkes to Narromine section in New South Wales. Some of those areas are obviously in the member's electorate.                  So we have a real commitment to getting the inland rail project underway. It is a project that will make a real difference to the movement of freight between our second and third largest cities but also provide new outlets for production, particularly in inland New South Wales, the member's electorate, to enable it to get to a port more smoothly and more efficiently. This is a major new project that will make a real difference to the transport network of our nation.

  What this government wants to do is establish fairness. It is not fair that the staff of the member who just asked this question get access to paid parental leave at their wage and people working as shop assistants in milk bars, in the small businesses of country Australia do not. What I want to do is to ensure that there is fairness across urban and regional Australia by ensuring that every Australian gets access to a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme. I know that members opposite are disappointed that they did not have the guts to think of this and put it forward as policy.                      That is the truth, Madam Speaker.                     Why should public servants have access to paid parental leave at their wage and not the rest of Australia? Why should the Leader of the Opposition's staff have access to paid parental leave at their wage and not the rest of Australia?                      So I want one rule for everyone and that rule is that paid parental leave should be paid at a person's wage. People get paid holiday pay at their wage, they get paid sick pay at their wage, they get paid long service leave at their wage and, finally, under this government, they will get paid parental leave at their wage. That is fair. That is just. That is modern. It is social reform and it is economic reform, and it will be delivered by this government.

  The great thing about our paid parental leave scheme is that it extends the fundamental principle that people should be paid parental leave at their wage, from the Public Service here in Canberra to the country areas of Australia. That is what it does. It establishes the same rule for the whole country that, when you go on paid parental leave, you get paid at your wage. Not just as a public servant in Canberra and not just as a high-priced city lawyer or accountant but as a hardworking small-business employee in country Australia, at last you get paid your paid parental leave at your wage.                 Under us, right around Australia, parental leave is a workplace entitlement, not a welfare entitlement. It is just, it is fair, it is modern, it will be delivered by this government and it establishes fairness between city and country Australia - at last.

  I thank the member for Ryan for her question. I am pleased to be able to tell her and the House that the government's higher education reforms are expanding opportunity to more young Australians, up to 80,000 more, typically from low socioeconomic status backgrounds, and at the same time promoting excellence in our universities. Eighty thousand more young Australians will go on, on average, to earn 75 per cent more than those Australians who do not have a higher education qualification.                 Our higher education reforms rebalance the contribution between taxpayers and students. Currently, taxpayers are funding 60 per cent of the cost of a student's higher education and the student is typically paying around 40 per cent. After our reforms are passed, the contribution will be about 50-50 between taxpayers and students. As we know that students will go on to earn 75 per cent more, on average, than those Australians who do not have a higher education qualification, that seems a very fair exchange between the taxpayer and the students.                 It is important that there be consistency in approach in policy, not just in higher education but across government. For example, in higher education, the Leader of the Opposition says that he is in favour of the worker; he is in favour of expanding opportunity to students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds; but he said that he opposes the very reforms that will expand opportunity to many other Australians, particularly young once.                 But the Leader of the Opposition does have a bit of form on this. He has a bit of form on inconsistency. Before 2007, Labor tried to convince the Australian public that they supported the Howard government's policies on border protection. Between 2008 and 2013, they allowed 50,000 unauthorised arrivals into Australia after dismantling those very same policies. Since the 2013 election, they have tried to take credit for stopping the boats. Initially they said it was their policies that stopped the boats. Now, today they want to tip their hat to the green left friends, the green left allies -                      Thank you, Madam Speaker, and I will. I am merely pointing out that 'Bob-each-way Bill' wants to have it both ways when it comes to higher education and border protection. 'Bob-each-way Bill' wants to be on the side of the people smugglers and the side of stopping the boats at the same time, and it is not possible for him to do so.                     I most certainly will. Whether it is school funding, ripping $1.2 billion out and claiming to have put more money in; whether it is backing Diana Asmar for the HSU election or giving money to Marco Bolano to run against her; whether it is being in favour of the mining tax in Canberra but against it in Perth - in favour of Kevin Rudd, against Kevin Rudd; in favour of Julia Gillard, against Julia Gillard - 'Bob-each-way Bill' has to start showing some consistency.

  The figure that the member for Ballarat cites was not in a Labor budget. There were unsustainable, undeliverable, pie-in-the-sky promises that were only made by the former government because they knew they would never be called upon to deliver them. Let us make it absolutely crystal clear for the umpteenth time: under this government public hospital funding increases every year; under this government health spending increases every year; and public hospital funding goes up nine per cent this year, nine per cent next year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent in the fourth year.                     The member opposite can bellow all she likes, but the fact is that public hospital spending and health spending go up every year. The difference is that our spending is sustainable in a way that the former government's was not, because this coalition government is tackling the debt and deficit disaster which members opposite are so rightly embarrassed about. They are rightly embarrassed about the debt and deficit disaster that they bequeathed to the nation that means that every single month we are now paying $1 billion in dead money that we should not have to pay. Just think how much better we could do when it comes to building new public hospitals if we were not wasting $1 billion every single month because people like the member that asked that this question were just out-and-out incompetent and utterly untrustworthy.

  It was an excellent question from the member for Lyons. I know the three amigos from Tasmania all could have asked that. In fact, all of us on this side of the House understand how crucial and central small business success is to a strong economy and to vibrant, energetic communities. That is why we have to fix the budget mess that was left to this government by Labor. We have to deal with the debt and deficit.                 As I travel around Australia, talking with small businesses, something that comes up is that they know they cannot pay their overdraft bill on their visa card. They know they just cannot keep building the debt and deficits in their operations and hope to be successful into the future. They know if they want to pass that business onto their family they cannot laden it with all of this debt that denies opportunity and prospects into the future. They understand that, and that is why small businesses have said to me, 'Good on you for tackling the debt and deficit legacy that Labor's left behind.' For the local government representatives here, they know small businesses and family enterprises are the heart of so many economies. This is a message we hear everywhere we travel: 'Get on with the task of fixing the budget mess. We know you didn't create it, but just as has happened so many times in history, Labor creates the mess and the coalition is left to fix it.'                  So the Economic Action Strategy does that. It also lays the economic foundations to create more jobs to support small business success. ACCI has recognised this. They said:                 The budget goes a long way to restoring all important business confidence that will drive investment and job creation, particularly for Australia's two million small businesses -                  Now ACCI has had a lot to say as well about the carbon tax - a central element of our economic action strategy. They know the carbon tax has caused great harm and hardship to small business. They said it is one of the highest in the world. It is making our key industries less competitive. They said:                 For small business especially, this has been a major burden that has reduced profitability, suppressed employment -                  They have recognised that in this tough economic climate, so why make it harder? We have to get this carbon tax repeal bill through. I am encouraged by the noise coming from the Senate that this may well happen but I wonder if Labor is at all interested in restoring the 519,000 jobs lost in small business under Labor and whether they will care enough to get on board with the implementation of this Economic Action Strategy. We sit and celebrate Patty Mills and Aron Baynes with their contribution to the Spurs and the NBA, the Kookaburras, the Hockeyroos' efforts and the Socceroos in Brazil but, if we thought that they were carrying lead in their shoes to slow them down and impede their performance, no-one would think that was right and reasonable. But Labor thinks that is perfectly acceptable when it comes to applying a carbon tax that acts as a reverse tariff that makes it a difficult job creating opportunities and employment for small business. Get on board I say to Labor, or get out of the road while we restore those jobs lost under your administration.

  It is fair and it is affordable. It is fair because it delivers paid parental leave to the whole of Australia, not just to the public servants who work for members opposite. It is affordable because it is paid for by a modest levy on the 3,000 most profitable and largest companies in our country. So it is fair, it is affordable and it is just. It should be delivered because we have promised it at not one but two elections, and it will be delivered under this government.                 The logic of members opposite is that it is all right for public servants to be paid at their wage but somehow it is wrong for shop assistants, people working in small business and all of those decent, hardworking women working in the suburbs of Brisbane, Sydney and elsewhere and in regional towns. How can members opposite claim to be friends of the workers of Australia when they do not want female workers to get paid parental leave at their wage? How can they? Really and truly, why is it fair for the Leader of the Opposition's staff to get paid parental leave at their wage and not every other Australian? It is simply not fair.

  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, and it is good to see the polite nature in which you keep this chamber.                     I want to thank the member for his question. There were two parts to the question. The second part was about international competitiveness. It is quite simple: you have either cheap power or cheap wages. We are the party and coalition of cheap power and those on the other side are the party of the alternative strategy, which is not actually cheap wages but unemployment.                 The first part of the question is about how the carbon tax relates to you through the day. If you wake up in the morning nice and early before the sun rises, as you do in the country, you turn on the light and you pay the carbon tax. When you go out to the kitchen and put on the kettle and get yourself ready, you are paying the carbon tax. When you turn on the shower and the pump turns on, you are paying the carbon tax. When you turn on the welder when you go out to work, you are paying the carbon tax. When you turn on the tractor, you are paying the carbon tax. When you go to the pie shop for a smoko, you pay the carbon tax. You might get something else as well - maybe an insult from the Leader of the Opposition. If you are planting a crop, you pay the carbon tax. If you are putting cattle on a truck -                      when those opposite are in power, you are going to pay 6.85c a litre more. You are going to pay the carbon tax. If you send off those cattle to an abattoir -  and I know you have 400 employees up there at a Teys abattoir in Biloela - you pay the carbon tax. It does no matter where you go, with this crowd opposite you will pay the carbon tax.                 But I think there might be a glimmer of hope on the horizon because I have been listening to some others. I found out from an article by Rob Burgess that Mr Shorten is quite capable of a policy backflip. That was said by one of his colleagues. I thought that could not be right because a man of his integrity would never backflip! But I found out that back on 30 October 2013 he said that he would stand firm in his support for a price on carbon but told Jonathan Swan on 1 November that he would terminate the carbon tax. How could a person go from standing firm beside you to terminating you? What sort of character would stand behind you and then terminate you? That is a good question for the member for Fraser, who did stand beside Kevin Rudd but then terminated him. It is also a good question for the member for Sydney, who stood beside Julia Gillard but then terminated her as well.                 Luckily Labor's Mark Butler has revealed that the party would look to build an alternative strategy. What is that alternative strategy? Is that alternative strategy the member for Sydney coming forward? Is that the alternative strategy?

  I will make three points in response to the Leader of the Opposition. First of all, fuel excise indexation was first introduced by the Labor Party. So how can they be so upset by something that they themselves invented?                 The second point I make is that every single cent that is raised by fuel excise indexation will be hypothecated to roads, and that - and this is my third point - is a very good deal for country Australia.                     I was asked about country Australia, and I am explaining how this is a great budget for country Australia, because at long last, as a result of this budget, we duplicate the Pacific Highway, we upgrade the Bruce Highway, we upgrade the Midland Highway, and we build the Toowoomba Range crossing. This is a budget that delivers in spades for country Australia.

  I want to thank the member for Barker. He is somebody who knows more than a little bit about fairness to farmers and rural and regional families. He knows this, because he grew up on the land. He knows this as the son of a farming family. He knows this because he actually represents a rural area with people who pay the carbon tax daily.                 In particular, he raised the issue of United Dairy Products, which has a carbon tax bill to date of approximately $800,000. It has two plants within his electorate - Murray Bridge and Jervois. It has 100 employees, but it is not the only dairy that pays the bill. Murray Goulburn has a direct carbon tax bill of $2.5 million, plus electricity and gas. Fonterra has a direct carbon tax bill of $3 million, plus electricity and gas. Tatura Milk has a direct carbon tax bill of $666,000, plus electricity and gas. So this carbon tax - today, right now - is a continuing tax on milk and on dairy farmers, who, according to the Australian Dairy Industry Council, will pay between $1,000 and $3,000 per farm per year. So dairy farmers, who already do it tough, are being hit with a carbon tax not just on their production, not just on their family incomes, but also on the milk they produce. That is what the opposition is giving us.                 But who is standing in the way of repealing the carbon tax. Only two days ago we heard some wonderful news. I want to go back to the statement from the member for Port Adelaide on Australian Agenda:                 We do support the abolition of the carbon tax.                 What a moment. One would imagine from that statement that they are going to vote for the abolition of the carbon tax. Well, next week you have the opportunity to make good on that statement - the abolition of the carbon tax - because the bills will be back before this House. But there was something else the member for Port Adelaide said in that interview. When asked about if the carbon tax was repealed he said:                 We will obviously as an opposition have to take stock and over the next year or two build an alternative policy.                 But this morning a little email fell into my hands, one that was sent to Labor Party members from the member for Port Adelaide. It said:                 Actually, we have been arguing in the parliament for an emissions trading scheme ever since the election.                 He says one thing to the Australian people on Sunday and another thing quietly this morning. They are completely confused. If they want to do something, get out of the way -

  I thank the member for his question. I want to pay tribute to the member for Fraser, who, as everybody in this place knows, is the political love child of Bob Hawke and Jenny Macklin. He is a believer in the co-payment, because he wants to make Medicare sustainable, and we pay tribute to him again today. The Labor Party has had him in the witness protection program for the last couple of weeks. Come on down, member for Fraser.                     Just to update the House with words that have been said well after the honourable member left university -                      If I were Tanya Plibersek, I would not be talking about health - if I were the member for Sydney. She was the worst health minister since Federation!                     Of course, Madam Speaker. The member for Sydney, of course, presided over one of the most shameful periods in Australian health policy. We will come back to the GP superclinics in time, so do not panic. We will detail more of your successes - open paddocks that exist across Australia, vacant paddocks with patients turning up having read your press releases, but still no clinics are built. Years and years of promises. Labor wasted money. They wasted money and they refused to listen to the wise counsel of the member for Fraser. Bob Hawke promised the Australian people sustainability in Medicare and he said it was required by way of a co-payment. We have listened to that advice. We have looked at the fact that Medicare is unsustainable with an ageing population and with the onset of all of the chronic diseases that will present over the coming decades. We are determined to put more money into Medicare, and we do in this budget.                     If we want to make it sustainable, we have to make sure that the co-payment - $5 of which goes into the Medical Research Fund, $2 of which goes to doctors to help supplement the money they get from Medicare -                      That will make Medicare sustainable. We understand that Jenny Macklin, as she then was, was the author of a paper that was relied on by Mr Howard, the then health minister for Bob Hawke. History dictates that we have to do something sensible to reform Medicare, and we do it in this budget. Labor wasted billions of dollars in the Health portfolio. In this budget we provide Australia with a way to strengthen and sustain Medicare for decades to come. We are absolutely determined to clean up Labor's waste and get Medicare and health back on track. We increased hospital funding. We increased funding within the Health portfolio in this budget. We will do it in a way that will set up Medicare for a decade.

  We are reorganising more than a hundred separate programs into five. That is why we believe that we can make modest savings in this area and still deliver more to the Indigenous people of our country. The trouble with members opposite is that they spent money but they did not get outcomes. That is the sad truth. When it comes to Indigenous affairs, more than most, they spent money without getting outcomes. This is a government which is determined to get outcomes. We are still spending the money but we are doing it more efficiently. In my portfolio alone, more than $2 billion a year is spent under this budget. In the Health portfolio alone, almost $1 billion a year is spent on Indigenous health. We will spend the money, but we will do it efficiently, we will do it effectively. That is what the Indigenous people of this country deserve.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. Australians have always had to cope with the tyranny of distance. It is a vast continent and South Australia alone is a vast state. The honourable member's seat is the largest electorate in South Australia, representing most of the state. His constituents know very well -                      the problems of isolation that only modern telecommunications can resolve. When the South Australian government, back in 1870, decided to build the Overland Telegraph, they completed it in two years. The federal Labor government that preceded us announced in 2009 that they were starting construction on their broadband project. Indeed, the member for Adelaide announced that connectivity was imminent in her electorate, in Prospect. She said that part was next in line for the NBN. That was in 2010, and I can tell the honourable member that that particular precinct will be switched on in a few months. That has taken four years. At the time of the election, there was not one fixed wireless tower operative in South Australia - not one. Fixed wireless is absolutely vital because that is the technology that enables us to service the areas outside of the big cities where a fixed line solution is not viable, and of course, in addition to that, there is the satellite.                 The remarkable thing about the Labor fixed wireless project was not only did they dramatically underestimate the number of towers and premises that would need to be covered - in fact, the NBN has calculated it will need nearly twice as many towers as the Labor government had estimated - but, more importantly, there were 80,000 premises in areas which had no spectrum at all. What was it going to be powered with? Was it going to be powered, driven by the charisma of the previous minister, Senator Conroy? Or, indeed, could it have been powered by the charm of the member for Grayndler? Who knows what sort of Conrovian physics would be able to allow new technologies?                 Let me say that we have already in South Australia activated the first five towers, serving over 1,000 premises. Nationally, the size of the fixed wireless network has increased by 130 per cent since the election and the number of customers using it and paying for it - a focus from our part, not the previous government - has increased by sixfold to 15,000. Last month alone, the NBN started construction on fixed wireless sites in 43 locations. We are getting on with the job.

  We said we would fix the mess. We said we would fix the mess, and wasn't there a mess - debt and deficit disaster stretching out as far as the eye can see? Let's remind members opposite of exactly their own record: six budgets, the six biggest deficits in Australia's history and not a surplus in sight.                     In case the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten, let me remind him what this government promised repeatedly before the election. We promised that we would stop the boats, and the boats are stopping. We promised that we would scrap the carbon tax, and, Senate permitting, that will happen within a month.                     Members opposite promised a surplus year in, year out.                     The Leader of the Opposition even misused taxpayer funding, telling his electorate that a surplus had actually been delivered.                     I am afraid members opposite are obviously coming to the end of their tether.                   The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     This question time is obviously overtaxing members opposite. The Leader of the Opposition did not just promise a budget surplus; he claimed it had actually been delivered. The Leader of the Opposition was a serial misleader of the Australian people. He was serially incapable of telling the truth. He did not tell the truth to Julia Gillard. He did not tell the truth to Kevin Rudd. He does not tell the truth to anyone. We said we would fix up the budget mess, and that is exactly what this government is doing.

  Let me thank the member for Cowan for his question and acknowledge his service to our nation in uniform. As a fellow military graduate from RMC Duntroon, he would be happy to know that not only is this graduating class today the 124th; but it has been 100 years since RMC graduates actually graduated from that august institution.                 It has been a great pleasure recently to launch the ADF gap year, a key election policy from this side of the chamber, a policy we are proud of and a policy I had the privilege to recently launch at Mitchelton State High School with the member for Ryan and the member for Brisbane. We are proud of the ADF gap year because it is aimed at school leavers to give those young Australians the opportunity to experience life in the Defence Force and to learn skills that will, hopefully, help them get a job if not in the ADF then in the wider workforce in the country.                 The program was conceived and it was begun during the Howard years. The gap year was and is again now a program that gives young people an opportunity - professional training, life skills, friends - so you would expect those opposite to support it. Unfortunately, that was not the case. In the early years of the last, wretched, government they had the good sense to leave it alone. You had the good sense to do nothing. But you couldn't help yourselves, could you? You turned Joel's - sorry, the member for Hunter's Force 2030 into Force 2045, you cut $25 billion from the budget and you cut the ADF gap year.                     Madam Speaker, 53 per cent of those in the gap year went on to serve in the permanent active force. This is what you cut. A third of those who joined the gap year were women. That is what Labor cut. The most successful female recruitment program the ADF has ever run is what Labor cut. Forty-eight per cent of those young ladies that went into the gap year then went on to serve either permanent or part time, yet the member for Canberra had the temerity weeks ago to attack us about challenges in recruiting women when the women recruitment levels have gone up under this government. Where were you, Member for Canberra, when the gap year was cut? Where was the member for Sydney when the gap year was cut? The most successful recruitment for women in the ADF - and where was the member for Sydney or the member for Canberra? Two-and-half-thousand young Australians have signed up to the gap year this time around and 35 per cent of them are young women.                 We are proud to bring back the highly successful gap year. And I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it's a shame you didn't have a chance to do the gap year, otherwise you would have learned a thing or two about leadership.

  Like the member who was asked the question, I value and appreciate the great work that our tradies do. I appreciate the need for proper training systems. The problem is that -                      for all their talk, members opposite were much better at spending money than they were at getting a result. Under the policies of members opposite, some 50 per cent of apprentices never completed their training. So what we want is a better training system.                     Members opposite actually cut $2.4 billion for skills training in the 2012 MYEFO. Members opposite promised 2,650 trade training centres. They delivered fewer than 350 of those.                     I want to assure the House that, under this government, money will be invested sensibly and good results will be achieved. We will spend some $5 billion on training over the forward estimates period. Very importantly, we will be giving trainees access to trade support loans because they deserve support on the same basis that university students have. We want a fair system, a good system, a flexible system and a productive system. That is what people will get under this government.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. It is an excellent question. I can assure her that this government were elected to do a number of very important things. We were elected to scrap the carbon tax, because that will save households $550 a year. We were elected to stop the boats, because that will stop the deaths and also save some $2.5 billion over four years. We were elected to build the infrastructure of the 21st century, because, thanks to the neglect of state Labor governments, Australia's roads have been turned into the world's longest parking lot. We were elected above all else to clean up Labor's budget mess -                      which had given us the sixth biggest deficits in history, deficits stretching out as far as the eye can see and debts peaking at $670 billion. As a result of Labor's budget mess, the Commonwealth is currently borrowing $1 billion every single month. We are borrowing $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on Labor's debt. That is dead money.                 Think what we could do if we were not paying $1 billion every single month just to cover the interest on Labor's debt. Within a year we could fully fund the upgrade of the Bruce Highway. Within two months we could fully fund the Toowoomba range crossing. Within three months we could pay for the Western Sydney infrastructure package. Within six months we could fund the duplication of the Pacific Highway. In over 12 months we could fund the East West Link in Melbourne. In one month we could fund the north-south road in Adelaide. In a month we could fund the Gateway Motorway upgrade in Brisbane. In just two weeks we could fund the Midland Highway project in Tasmania. In less than a week we could fund the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. In less than a month we could fund the Perth Gateway and in another month we could more than fund the Swan Valley bypass.                     I say to the member for Grayndler that the Labor Party were economic vandals in office and in opposition they are even worse. The Leader of the Opposition is groaning and moaning on the other side of the ministerial table. He is all complaint and no solution. Members opposite stand for bigger deficits, more debt and open borders.

  This is the right budget for Australia because it tackles Labor's debt and deficit disaster. As for the figure that the Leader of the Opposition bandies about, I challenge him to produce one of the Labor Party's budgets which has that figure in it. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to come up with a single Labor budget with that figured in it.                      There is no cut because there was no budget that contained it from members opposite.                      There is no Labor budget that made the commitment that the Leader of the Opposition refers to. This was a pie-in-the-sky, undeliverable promise from the Labor Party, that was never contained in any single budget. When it comes to schools, let me be very clear, there is an eight per cent increase this year, an eight per cent increase next year, an eight per cent increase the year after that, and a six per cent increase in the final year. When it comes to public hospitals, there is a nine per cent increase this year, a nine per cent increase next year, a nine per cent increase the year after that, and a six per cent increase in the final year.                     On the question of indexation, members opposite changed the indexation of the family tax benefit from male total average weekly earnings to CPI. Members opposite demonstrated by their actions that the CPI is a fair indexation system. If it was fair for members opposite to do it for the family tax benefit, it is fair for this government to do it to other benefits. If it was fair for Labor to do it, it is fair for the coalition to do it. This is a fair budget, an honest budget, and above all else, it is the right budget for Australia because it deals with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. We have our plan to deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. We have demonstrated how we are going to clean up Labor's mess. It is about time that Labor demonstrated how they will clean up the mess they created.

  I thank the honourable member for Wright for that question. He is an indefatigable advocate for good economic policy. He has been in the door on regular occasions and has been a strong advocate for government to live within its means. As the Prime Minister just said, this is a very fair budget and a very honest budget. I know that comes as a rude shock to the Labor Party given they delivered six budgets in a row from the member for Lilley, that were both unfair and dishonest. No budget could be more dishonest than the one delivered by the member for Lilley when he claimed that he was announcing on that night four budget surpluses in a row. We miss you, Swannie! Now of course he is writing a book - or actually, the Parliamentary Library is writing a book on his behalf - and we look forward to the wisdom that comes from that book.                 The legacy of six years of Labor was $667 billion of debt, if no action is taken. Somehow they tend to believe that a number like that is pretty irrelevant - $667 billion with no surpluses on the horizon. The interest that the Australian people would pay on that $667 billion would be $3 billion a month. Currently, we are paying $1 billion a month, but the legacy of Labor waste and expenditure lifted it to $3 billion a month, and 70 per cent of that goes to people living overseas because they are the people that have lent us the money.                 There has been a lot of debate about whether it is a budget emergency or a budget crisis, so I want to go -                      They are laughing! I am glad they are because I just want to cite someone very close to the Labor Party. That is why Swannie has got his head down - and you should all learn from him. The Reserve Bank of Australia board member John Edwards, principal adviser to Paul Keating and appointed by the Labor Party to the Reserve Bank, said yesterday:                 I've no doubt there is a budget crisis -                  Hello, someone in the Labor Party that understands economics knows that it is a budget crisis! He went on:                 We're accumulating debt as a higher share of GDP and of course in absolute terms, [it's] absolutely astronomical compared to far more serious episodes in Australian history, including recoveries from serious recessions.                 If we do not do something about the debt and deficit legacy of Labor, we will face a crisis in Australia. In fact a Reserve Bank board member appointed by the Labor Party says that it exists now so to Labor I say: get out of the way and let us fix the budget!

  I am pleased that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked me about the New South Wales budget, because the budget that the New South Wales treasurer has brought down is a very good budget. It builds on the outstanding work of the former treasurer, now Premier Mike Baird, who is really doing very good work indeed. Commonwealth funding to New South Wales is increasing by $5.8 billion thanks to the budget that we brought down. Commonwealth spending to New South Wales is up by $5.8 billion thanks to the budget that this Commonwealth government brought down a few weeks ago, and that is $1.4 billion more than would have been the case under the policies of members opposite. Right around this country, thanks to the budget that we brought down, the states will be $9 billion better off over the next four years. This is a bonanza for the state governments under this government; it is an infrastructure bonanza. It is not just unsustainable recurrent spending, because this government is shifting spending out of short-term consumption and into long-term investment, because that is what we want to do. We want to build a strong and prosperous economy so that over the long term our country will be safe and secure.                 Again, for the benefit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in New South Wales, year on year, hospital funding grows by eight per cent, 10 per cent, 10 per cent and eight per cent. In New South Wales, year on year, schools funding grows by seven per cent, eight per cent, nine per cent and six per cent. This Commonwealth government is investing $15 billion in infrastructure in New South Wales. I am very proud of that, because there is a terrible infrastructure gap in New South Wales because of the neglect of members opposite. Because of the neglect of members opposite, roads in Sydney are some of the world's longest car parks. Well, that is going to change under this government. I am determined to be the infrastructure Prime Minister, and I am proud that with the help of this government Mike Baird will be the infrastructure Premier.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. Of course he has a perfect right to bring petitions to this parliament on any subject at any time, and I respect the member's commitment to the environment. But I do say, in response to the member for Denison, that I too am a conservationist and I regard myself as as much of a conservationist as any member of this parliament.                     The challenge that all of us in this parliament face in respect of the great state of Tasmania is to try to ensure that the great state of Tasmania is an economy as well as a national park. We need to ensure that the great state of Tasmania is a strong economy as a well as a beautiful national park. We need to ensure that the great state of Tasmania is a good place to work as well as -                      I understand and appreciate and share the commitment of the member for Denison to Tasmania's forests. They are great renewable resources as well as pristine and beautiful places, and I want the people of Tasmania to be able to work in forests as well as to walk in forests. I want people to be able to make a living from forests as well as to appreciate their natural beauty. This is a question of getting the balance right, and the member for Denison can trust this government to do just that.

  I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. I note that he is a very worthy successor to his hugely impressive predecessor. Coming from Western Australia, he knows how important it is to repeal the carbon tax. I regret to inform the House that as a result of Labor's refusal to terminate the carbon tax the carbon tax will go up on 1 July this year from $24.15 a tonne to $25.40 a tonne - a five per cent increase in the carbon tax. If the Labor Party let us keep our election promise to get rid of the carbon tax, and if Labor were not blocking the repeal of the carbon tax, then we could get rid of the carbon tax immediately and prevent it going up on 1 July next year. They have already had a chance to support our repeal of the carbon tax laws. We are going to give them another chance next week to repeal that carbon tax laws before the carbon tax goes up again, on 1 July.                 We know the Leader of the Opposition has been running around to a few business groups in the last 24 hours. He spoke to the CEO's of some foreign entities and to the Business Council of Australia. What he has is one message for business and another message for the public. The message to businesses is along the lines, 'Don't worry, that carbon tax is going to go.' But to the public he says, 'Hang on, we are fighting to keep the carbon tax, because we want to see your electricity prices rise.' And rise they will.                 Getting rid of the carbon tax on average relieves each household of $550 in costs. It was almost one year ago that Kevin Rudd - remember him? - stated before the election, in the electorate of Herbert, in Townsville:                 The Labor government has decided to terminate the carbon tax to help cost-of-living pressures for families and to reduce the costs for small business.                 There was Kevin, under the palm trees, up there with the member for McMahon right by his side - I hope he has not forgotten that. The member for McMahon was there saying that terminating the carbon tax was part of our positive economic plan.                 But that was 12 months ago - like, they don't keep their promises.                     When it comes to being loyal and honest, you are not at the top of the queue, Bill. One of the best examples of that is your backflip on the carbon tax.

  For the benefit of the person who asked the question, let me repeat that every year school and hospital funding goes up under this government, and every year school and hospital money for the state governments goes up. The shadow Treasurer really should quote more completely if he is going to be taken seriously. If he wants to quote one, let me quote another. The Deutsche Bank Research Report 2014-15, released yesterday, stated:                 We note that Commonwealth grants to New South Wales have actually increased over the forward projection period, relevant to the 2013-14 budget update.                 This government is not only delivering more money to schools and hospitals but it is also tackling Labor's debt and deficit disaster. That is why it is not only an honest budget, not only a truthful budget, but it is the budget Australia needs for these times.

  I thank the member for Solomon for her question. She will be pleased to know, as I know all members on this side of the House are, that given that we have now had almost six months of no successful people smuggling ventures to Australia, it is saving the budget $2.5 billion. In addition to that, it is ensuring that we have freed up 20,000 places in our special humanitarian program over this year out to the end of the forward estimates. Further to that, it has freed up more than 1,000 places for women at risk, which we noted earlier today at the opening of Refugee Week.                 What we found when we came to government was not that arrangement. We found something very different. By stopping the boats, we are able not only to get the budget under control and get the refugee and humanitarian program back under control and ensure it has integrity, but we are able to deal with the problems in the detention network and with the issues with offshore processing that were left to us by the previous government. Labor did leave us a mess. They left us a mess because $1.2 billion was the shortfall in funding for effectively implementing offshore processing. They announced it but they did not fund it. They are great on announcements - they announce surpluses that are never delivered and they announce offshore processing policies that were never funded.                 In addition to that there was inadequate infrastructure for children - for families. After their involvement in those offshore centres they had processed no-one at all. Not one. More than 100 people have received decisions and recommendations now under the arrangements put in place in Papua New Guinea and Nauru - and there were no resettlement arrangements, none at all.                 I am asked quite specifically by the member for Solomon about the issues on Christmas Island. I can tell you that at the last election the previous government had provided education to just 24 children on Christmas Island. There is a slight problem with that in that there were 140 primary-age children on Christmas Island at the time, and there were 425 children on Christmas Island at the time. That was addressed in this budget. There is $2.6 million to ensure that not just 24 children but every child held in detention on Christmas Island will go to school every single day. That is just one of the examples of cleaning up the mess. But the job is getting easier, because the number of children in detention is declining. The number of children right across our own networks and offshore is now fewer than 1,000. It has fallen by a third since the election. It has fallen by almost 50 per cent in mainland centres across Australia. You know how you get children out of detention? You stop the boats. That is how you do it. That is what this government is doing. That is why children are coming out of detention and that is why this government has been successful and you lot failed.

  I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition is a bit obsessed with the member for Perth - because she is the member who wants to scrap the mining tax! The newsletter put out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is entirely accurate. It is entirely accurate because we are improving indexation for the DFRDB and the DFRB pensions - as we promised. We are delivering precisely on our promise. But when it comes to dodgy newsletters, what about the Leader of the Opposition's?                     His newsletter - I must say that he looks a bit younger in the photograph in that newsletter; the pressure is getting to him - from 2012 promised, in big print on the front page, 'a budget surplus for a strong economy'. When? Throughout this mendacious document -                      When it comes to newsletters, the Leader of the Opposition is an absolutely serial deceiver of his electorate and a serial deceiver of the Australian people. If you cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition even to get a question right, why would you ever trust him with the future of this country?

  I thank the member for Longman for his question and I can inform the House that this afternoon, at the National Press Club, I launched the Australian government's new aid policy and our new strategic direction for the $5 billion a year aid program that makes Australia one of the top 10 donors in the OECD. I really want to thank the Deputy of Leader of the Opposition for her full endorsement of our aid program. Her media release referred to 'the Abbott government's fresh new approach on overseas aid'. Thank you very much; I appreciate that.                  What we are doing is focusing on our region - 90 per cent of our aid budget will be focused on the Indian Ocean-Asia Pacific. We are going to develop innovative ways to engage the private sector to promote economic development, to reduce poverty and to lift standards of living in our region. We will put in place performance benchmarks and mutual obligations with partner countries and we will work for better results. We are going to focus our aid investment on health and education, building capacity in workforces, infrastructure and, importantly, empowering women and girls. It is a fresh new approach. There will be no more raiding of the aid budget to cover Labor's blow-out in onshore - that is right, 'onshore' - processing costs. Seven hundred and forty million dollars was ripped out of the aid budget to cover their blow-outs in the immigration budget.                 You would have thought that, having left an interest bill of $1 billion a month on their borrowings, Labor would have developed some sort of responsible approach. But I could not believe it when yesterday the member for Kingsford Smith recommitted Labor to increasing the aid budget by $16 billion. Where is the money coming from? More debt! But you should not expect too much from the member for Kingsford Smith. Back when he was in government, he was telling us that he was eminently qualified to be the Parliamentary Secretary - this is serious - for Pacific Island Affairs because he regularly swims at Sydney beaches! There it is. He is an expert on the Pacific because he goes swimming on Sydney beaches! What next? You are a Pacific expert because you can see Fiji from your electorate?                  The Australian government will deliver a responsible, affordable, sustainable aid budget - and I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her endorsement of our new policy.

  Any letter that this government sends to people will at least be truthful, unlike the Leader of the Opposition's letter claiming, in 2012, that a budget surplus had been delivered. Is that true?                     Something else the Leader of the Opposition sent out to the public of Australia - I don't want to display it, but I am reading from it: 'Carbon tax abolished'. I stand amazed at the question from the Leader of the Opposition -                      given that he sent material out to the people of Australia claiming 'carbon tax abolished'. Really and truly. The barefaced gall. The absolute hide. The sheer front of this person. An absolute serial deceiver of the Australian people - just as he was a serial deceiver of former Prime Minister Rudd and former Prime Minister Gillard.                     Really and truly. For this Leader of the Opposition, for this serial deceiver of the Australian people, to complain about a letter that might be sent out by this government to tell the Australian people -                      that pensions will go up every March and every September, every single year, really and truly. If this Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about telling the truth -                      if this Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about being trustworthy, we are coming up to the fourth anniversary of -                      his trustworthiness to Prime Minister Rudd, and we are coming up to the first anniversary of his trustworthiness to Prime Minister Gillard. If Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard could not trust this Leader of the Opposition, the Australian people never can.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Yesterday I was very fortunate to meet with the mayors of Wyong and Gosford, from the New South Wales Central Coast, who are both very ably represented by the member for Dobell and the member for Robertson, very ably represented by them both. They were very pleased to hear how the government's higher-education reforms will be of such enormous benefit to a regional area like the Central Coast of NSW.                  It will be of benefit in three particular ways. They were very pleased to hear that because we are extending taxpayer subsidies, per student, to non-university higher-education providers that will be a financial shot in the arm to the four TAFEs that exist on the Central Coast of New South Wales; and on National TAFE Day it is good to be able to explain to TAFEs that they will get a large financial support out of the government, because of that first aspect of our reforms.                  Secondly, of course, we are removing the cap on diplomas and associate degrees so that universities - like the University of Newcastle - which offer a high preponderance of such associate degrees and diplomas, especially on the Central Coast, will be able to expand their offerings to students in an area that will service, eventually, 400,000 people on the NSW Central Coast. That will be a widening of opportunity to more students, particularly for those of low-socioeconomic-status backgrounds, who typically use those kinds of courses to go into undergraduate degrees and find a pathway to university.                 Finally, if the University of Newcastle does not take up the opportunity of both the lifting of the cap and the expansion of the Commonwealth Grant Scheme's non-university higher education providers, then the competition that we have created in the market will allow new entrants into the Central Coast of New South Wales to compete with the University of Newcastle, so forcing the University of Newcastle to, in fact, offer those courses - if they want to keep their market - or the new providers, using the new freedoms of a deregulated system, will be able to give low-SES young people on the New South Wales Central Coast the opportunity to get a higher-education qualification and improve their chances of increasing their income over a lifetime.                 It is very good news for regional Australia, in the higher-education reforms, and the mayors were very pleased to see it. These two measures alone are costing $820 million. So our priorities are to put $820 million into higher education. Labor's priority is to spend $1 billion a month - being sent to debtors overseas - to pay the interest alone on the government's debt that was left to us by Labor. Labor's priority is a billion dollars a month in interest repayments; ours is $820 million to expand opportunity.

  I am not sure what letter might have been sent out by the member for Hume; but I tell you what, it would not have been any better than the member for Fraser's letter:                 But there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all _ the ideal model involves a small co-payment -                      I am trying to compare the letter of the member for Hume with the letter of the member for Fraser. I am sure the member for Hume's letter was a fine letter, but I doubt whether he would have been able to do as well as the member for Fraser, who said:                 But there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all _ the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc.                  Good on the member for Fraser, who went on to say:                  And the idea is hardly radical.                 So, if the member for Hume is simply repeating the wisdom of the member for Fraser, good on the member for Hume.                     Members opposite made a big mistake with the member for Fraser. When they heard he was at the ANU they thought it was the AMWU - that is what it was. But it was a university, not a union!                     It was a place where they are committed to the truth, not where they are committed to slush funds and corruption.

  I thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question, because New South Wales receives almost $15 billion under the coalition's $50 billion infrastructure investment plan.                     What a difference that is going to make to the road system in New South Wales, both in Sydney and in provincial centres, and of course there is $5.6 billion for the Pacific Highway. Finally, the dream of duplicating the Pacific Highway all the way from Sydney to Brisbane will be achieved.                     There is $5.6 billion on the table over six years to complete that task. Before the end of this year the $115 million upgrade of the Kundabung to Kempsey sections and the $683 million for the Oxley Highway to Kundabung section will be underway. They will be major projects that will employ many people on the way but will also make a real difference to the movement of traffic along the Pacific Highway. There is another 115 kilometres between Woolgoolga and Ballina still to be commenced, but the design work is advancing on that project. All of this has been possible because the coalition has restored the traditional 80-20 funding mix for the Pacific Highway, unlike Labor, who were demanding that the state pay 50 per cent of the cost - money that they did not have. Under Labor this project would have taken a decade to complete, or even more, because the state would not have been able to find -                      Five point six billion dollars - that is not $1; that is $5.6 billion! That is money that will deliver the job. It will deliver the construction of this important piece of highway - something that would never have happened if Labor had been returned to government. This is indeed an extraordinary project. It will cut at least 90 minutes off the travel time for heavy transport - even more for lighter vehicles. What it will also do is reduce the road toll on this road - the number of deaths on the Pacific Highway. The work already completed has basically halved the number of deaths on the highway. This is an important project and one that the coalition will complete.

  It is an absolute honour to get a question from my shadow. Might I say it is going to be an absolute honour to answer it as well. We have already in our first tranche realigned $420 million of the Farm Finance Concessional Loans Scheme, which they were unable to get signed off by all of the states. On top of that, we put in $10 million for water infrastructure. We followed that up with a second drought package of $320 million, of which $280 million has been signed off by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the finance minister. QRAA is already able to lend that out, and they are lending it out through the tranches that have been made available to them within the $420 million. We have also made money available for wild dog control, and we have made money available for water infrastructure -                      Back on 4 March, we got through the transitional farm family payment, and over 1,300 people have applied for and received assistance. So there is quite a few dollars in that, you clown. We are getting these payments out because we are the side that can get the work done. You are the side that talk about it; we are the side that do it.

  I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. It is great to see someone who has not only graduated from TAFE in his electorate but also gone out and had a real job, unlike many on the other side who have basically just been trade union officials. The member for Hinkler has actually done a trade, gone out there and got his hands dirty and he is now doing an absolutely fine job representing the people of Hinkler. The member said in his maiden speech:                 _ without the opportunity to learn, you lose your ability to succeed.                     That is a fine line from someone who knows how important it is to learn, to get your trade and to get out there and not only secure an income but also be part of the earning economy. We on this side of the House want to make sure that we are putting out from training institutions people that are job ready, able to contribute and have the training and the skills that industry needs. As of 1 July, we will be starting our trade support loans which will assist apprentices through the time they are in training.                      This scheme is worth $1.9 billion over the forward estimates and will assist apprentices. Fourth year apprentices will be able to get up to $20,000. As we know, these loans are interest free. They will be indexed on 1 June each year and are interest free. These loans will see a 20 per cent discount to apprentices and certain skilled trainees once they graduate. That is what this scheme is all about. It is about assisting people on the way through their training so that they can meet their daily and weekly needs and giving them a bonus and an incentive when they have finished. We want to see these trainees and apprentices not only be supported but also have access to the best training institutions available. So we support the TAFE system. We support all the RTOs, as long as they provide a competitive and quality skills training system. We want to make sure that anyone, but young people particularly, embarking on a trade, like the member for Hinkler did, has the opportunity to get the best possible qualifications. This government will support them every inch of the way with a trade support loan. We will be able to put more into this area once we get over the $1 billion a month we have to pay in interest because of the debt the previous government left us.

  There are no changes to pensions in this term of parliament. It is as simple as that. There are no changes to pensions in this term of parliament. If the Australian people do not like what this government has proposed, they can take the appropriate action at the ballot box at the next election. I will tell you what this government is doing and why this is a budget that is honest and necessary for our country at this time. This government is outlining a clear plan to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster.                     We have demonstrated exactly what we propose to do to deal with the mess that Labor created. Now it is up to Labor to demonstrate what it will do to fix up the mess that it created. If Labor thinks that there is something fundamentally wrong about applying to pensions the indexation rate that they applied to the Family Tax Benefit -                      If Labor thinks that there is something fundamentally wrong with that, then they should tell us what they are going to do. They should tell us what they are going to do to fix up the Labor debt and deficit disaster, because, Madam Speaker, it is absolutely crystal clear, as things stand, that members opposite think there was no problem -                      with debt and deficit and there was no problem with broken promises -                      They are living in a fantasy world, that is what they are doing. As the Treasurer pointed out earlier today in question time, even John Edwards - a long-term Labor staffer, a long-term friend of the Labor Party and a decent human being, it has to be said, but someone whom Labor appointed to the Reserve Bank Board - has come out and said, 'Honestly, there is a budget crisis.' John Edwards is right: there is a budget crisis. We accept that; we have put out our plan to deal with it; and it is high time that members opposite woke up to reality and told us exactly what their plan is.

  I thank the member for his question. People have seen right through question time today, and really since the budget, that Labor is full of complaint but not solution. We have put forward a solution in this budget to make sure that Medicare is sustainable. Over the course of the last 10 years, the money that we spend each year on Medicare has gone from $8 billion to $20 billion. We have an ageing population. By 2050 7Â½ thousand Australians a week will be diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer's, and I want to make sure -                      that our health system is designed -                      so that we can take care of those people. I want to make sure that we can listen to the independent advice that was provided to Prime Minister Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard, when both those prime ministers commissioned independent reports into the health system. In both of those reports, Christine Bennett and Simon Keenan came back to Labor and said that the current health system is not sustainable. Bob Hawke knew it was not sustainable back in 1991, when he introduced the co-payment and we know that for 50 years Labor has supported a co-payment in the medicine scheme to make it is sustainable for our population.                   The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     We are absolutely determined in this budget to introduce a modest co-payment of $7. -                      If people cannot afford the $7, doctors still have the discretion to bulk-bill patients. Patients are bulk-billed by doctors by discretion and from 1 July next year doctors will have the same discretion to bulk-bill patients. Of the $7, $5 goes into a $20 billion medical research fund so that we can help meet all of those health needs into the coming decades; and the remaining $2 goes back to the doctors. A total of $468 million will help doctors to continue to bulk-bill and it will be in addition to the money that they receive under Medicare now. It is an incredibly important measure to make Medicare sustainable.                  Labor has not uttered one word about how they intend to listen to the advice that Prime Minister Rudd received to make Medicare sustainable. They are talking about $16 billion more for foreign aid; they are talking about putting more money into the union movement; they are talking about putting more money into education, health and everything else. But they will not tell Australians how they will pay for it. I noticed overnight in the United Kingdom, in the Times, a call for patients to pay $10 to see a GP. I think it is a very important discussion. In that discussion they are saying they want to introduce a co-payment because there is a Â£30 billion gap in the UK's NHS over the course of the next 10 years.                  We want to make our system sustainable, and we need to hear from the Labor Party how they will support, not oppose, that measure. They need to get out of the way.

  Because pensions go up every year. Pensions go up every year - every March pensions; every September pensions go up. Pensions will go up every single year. It is true that, come September 2017, if this government is re-elected, there will be a change in the rate of indexation. That is true, but pensions will continue to increase every single year. They will increase every March; they will increase every September; they will increase every single year. I say again to the rather noisy member for Jagajaga - the member for Jagajaga who is so honest and truthful that she promised in her 2012 budget update that 'we are back in surplus'.                     When are we back in surplus? Not 2012!                 Â                      There is no year ever when pensions go down. Every year pensions go up. They go up in March every year. They go up in September every year. They go up twice every year. The only difference is that from September 2017 they will be indexed by the same rate that the member for Jagajaga herself, as minister for family services, thought was fair and reasonable for the family tax benefit. If it is fair and reasonable for the family tax benefit, if it is just and moral for the family tax benefit, it is moral for other benefits as well. Not only was the member for Jagajaga being utterly untruthful in her budget update; she is being utterly untruthful now. She should be better than that - she really should be.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and note his very keen interest in this issue. Yesterday, Australia Post launched a rural sustainability package to support its licensed post offices. This is the latest in a series of initiatives that will contribute an additional $40 million a year to ensure the sustainability of the licensed post office retail network, and that is on top of $320 million paid annually to these licensees. For the first time, an additional 432 licensed post offices, almost all of whom are in rural and regional Australia, will be provided with access to Australia Post's electronic point of sale system, and it means they will now be able to deliver and get paid for additional services such as electronic payments and banking services.                  There are 2,550 licensed post offices, of which about two-thirds are in rural and regional Australia. They have been doing it tough because the economics of the post office has been worsening. I want to acknowledge the great work that is being done, sometimes to the discomfort of Australia Post and, indeed, to the minister by the Senate Environment and Communications Committee, chaired by Senator John Williams and vigorously encouraged by Senator Boswell, who is, of course, retiring at the end of this month. The challenges facing Australia Post are very significant. It is a very high-fixed-cost business. The letters business is a very high-fixed-cost business and every year letter volumes are declining. Every time there is a dollar less spent on letters, it is in excess of an 80c hit to the bottom line of the post office. As a result, about a billion fewer letters have been sent over the past five years. In the past two years, Australia Post has recorded a combined loss of more than $400 million in its regulated letters business. That trend is going to accelerate. It is expected that letter volumes will decline by about eight per cent each year into the future. Australia Post now forecasts a loss of more than $300 million in its letters business next year. The consequence of that is that, while it has a profitable retail business and a profitable parcels business, by next financial year it is expecting to record a total company loss because of the losses on letters overwhelming the profits on parcels. There is a widely-held view that the parcels business is growing so fast that it will overtake the losses in letters. That is simply not right. So there are big existential challenges for Australia Post. We are taking them on. We are looking at reform. We are looking at all the options. We are working hard with the management to ensure that it continues to deliver a relevant and sustainable service to all Australians.

  I can confirm that pensions will go up every six months under this government. They will go up every six months under this government. This government has absolutely delivered on its commitment not to change pensions in this term of parliament. We have absolutely delivered on our commitment not to change pensions in this term of parliament. It is true that we have not continued with a national partnership agreement on pensioner concessions, but pensioner concessions are overwhelmingly the preserve of the states. Less than 10 per cent of the value of pensioner concessions was provided by the Commonwealth, and, given that in this budget the Commonwealth is providing the states with some $9 billion more, we thought that this was a small price that the states could pay to the task of budget repair.                     I am pleased to say that, so far, every single state has undertaken to continue to maintain the value of pensioner concessions.

  I do thank the member for Forrest for her question. I can inform her and other members of the House that the government is making steady progress towards all of its key election goals. This government was elected to scrap the carbon tax, because that will save the households in Australia $550 a year, and legislation is before the Senate. This government was elected to build the infrastructure of the 21st century, because of years of neglect by state Labor governments, and work is soon underway on many of these projects. We were elected to clean up Labor's budget mess, because $1 billion a month in dead money is being wasted just to pay the interest on Labor's budget debt. This budget brings us back close to balance within four years.                  Above all else, this government was elected to stop the boats. There were a lot of policy catastrophes that were authored by members opposite, but perhaps the gold medal for incompetence and catastrophic policy failure was their border protection chaos. I can report to the House that -                      today Australia has reached the milestone: six months since the last successful people-smuggling operation to our country. That is six months without a boat.                     Madam Speaker, members on the other side are touchy on this, because in the last six months there has been not a single boat and no illegal arrivals by boat. In the comparable period under the former government there were almost 200 illegal boats and almost 13,000 illegal arrivals by boat. Operation Sovereign Borders is working. The boats are stopping, and that is saving lives. The boats are stopping, and that is saving the budget $2Â½ billion.                 I pay tribute to everyone involved in Operation Sovereign Borders, from the minister and General Campbell to the naval and Customs personnel, the police, the intelligence and the immigration staff, who are making it all work. I also pay tribute to our partner governments in Nauru, PNG, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Indonesia, whose corporation is also making these successful policies possible. Combating the people smugglers is an ongoing effort, but this government will remain vigilant to ensure that our borders are secure and our country is safe.

  I make two points in response to the Leader of the Opposition, and the first point is that pensions go up every six months. They go up every March and every September - this year, next year and the year after that.                      There are no cuts to pensions, because pensions go up every six months, every year. They go up in March and September this year, they go up in March and September next year and they go up in March and September the year after that. It is true that after September 2017 they will go up by the rate of indexation that members opposite, the Labor Party, thought was entirely fair for the family tax benefit.                     We have explained to the Australian people how we are going to deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. It is about time that Labor explained how it would deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Just for once, I say to the opposition: 'Outbid us on the quality of your ideas, not the strength of your negativity.' Who said that?                     I am not surprised that the Leader of the Opposition recognises that statement, because that is exactly what he said. We have told the Australian people how we are going to clean up Labor's debt and deficit disaster, and the Leader of the Opposition should tell us how he is going to fix the mess that he and his colleagues have created.

  I thank the member for Canning for his question. There is no greater supporter on the government benches of this government's border protection policies than the member for Canning. He has been instrumental in particular in our relationship with Sri Lanka and in the partnership we have had with Sri Lanka. I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs would concur with that.                     I can confirm, as the Prime Minister already has, that it has been six months since the last successful people-smuggling venture to Australia. Frankly, under Operation Sovereign Borders, that is just another day at the office. It is another day at the office for the men and women who comprise the Operation Sovereign Borders team, whether they are in our Navy, our Customs and Border Protection Service, the Department of Immigration or our Federal Police. All of those agencies are working together to achieve the results we have achieved to date. Together with the Prime Minister, I thank them for their service. This House should also thank them for their service and what they have been able to achieve.                  There are alternative approaches and there have been other approaches in the past. The previous government engaged in a reckless, conceited and dangerous experiment from 2007 onwards. The purpose of that experiment was to try and prove that John Howard had it wrong on border protection. They abolished every brick in the wall of border protection that John Howard and his government had built up over the term of that government. What was the result? More than 50,000 people turning up on more than 800 boats; almost 1,200 people dying at sea; 15,000 people denied permanent visas under our Refugee and Humanitarian Program; and detention centres being built every other day and then burning down under the same government that built them. It was chaos, it was cost and it was tragic. That was the result of the alternative approaches and the experiment.                      Who is this fellow? I have not seen him in more than 100 days.                     The deputy shadow minister for immigration, with the real minister being Senator Hanson-Young, has saved himself from having to ask a question here today.                   The member for Corio then left the chamber.                     Everything they did when they were in government was -                  Â                      The experiment, thank goodness, is over and the results are in. The results are that John Howard had it right and this government had it right, because we have not had a successful people-smuggling venture to this country in six months. My advice to those opposite is: get over it. Understand that you got it wrong and it is time to look this way when it comes to border protection policies that work. Get on board with the things that are saving lives and putting the integrity back into our immigration program that was lost on the conga line of failures who now sit on the opposition bench who used to sit on this side. They should look this way for success.

  At the risk of repeating myself, I just want to point out to members opposite that all pensions will go up in March and September every year.                     All pensions will go up in March and September every year, but what will happen in September 2017 - after the next election - is that the indexation rate will change to a rate which the Labor Party thought was fair for family tax benefit. If it is fair for family tax benefit, it is fair for other social security benefits. If the Labor Party thought it was fair for family tax benefit, they ought to think it is fair for what this government has done.                     The Leader of the Opposition should stop trying to scare the pensioners of this country.                   The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     He should stop trying to curry political favour on the basis of a scare. It is cheap. It is unworthy. Decent Labor leaders like Bob Hawke and Paul Keating would be ashamed of it. Even the Leader of the Opposition was once above this kind of thing. He said in this House in 2011:                 We in the Labor Party do not rely on scaring people to obtain power _                 If it was true in 2011, it certainly is not true in 2014.

If the member for McEwen had cared to wait and hear the answer, I was actually talking about theatre students from non-mainstream schooling who have been hurt by trauma and abuse and are finding their way back into higher education through the arts, in the member for Indi's electorate. If he had cared to be a little bit better mannered, he would have heard that that is what I was talking about. But unfortunately I expect very little from the member for McEwen.                 To answer the member for Indi's question, I know that she cares very deeply about education, as the transformative nature of it can help kids like the ones from Highwater Theatre, but also young people across Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas, lift their qualifications and their opportunity to get better jobs and earn more income. In terms of the deregulation of fees, the tremendous opportunity presented by our reforms is to let universities make their own decisions about what they value the most in their institutions and what they believe they can charge higher fees for and also, in regional and rural areas, how to price their courses in order to compete with the institutions in the city.                 The great thing about the Commonwealth scholarships fund is that each university will get the opportunity to make its own decisions about how to attract students through scholarships. So in a rural and regional area - as many of the coalition members who represent rural and regional areas would also be interested to know - they will be able to tailor their scholarships to what they think will most attract students, whether they are from the local area or whether they are from the city, to regional areas. They might decide to forgo tuition fees for those students. They might decide to help them with living expenses in order to move to rural and regional areas. They might decide to pay them relocation expenses. The reason why each institution will make its own decisions about fees and how to spend its Commonwealth scholarships, within the guidelines that the Commonwealth will develop through our working groups, is so that they can compete with suburban institutions. I see great opportunities for rural and regional institutions in our reforms.                 I would also point out to the member that there have been some excellent articles written about this by rural and regional vice-chancellors or former vice-chancellors like Jim Barber, from the member for New England's electorate. He was the former Vice-Chancellor at UNE. In the Australian Financial Review just after the budget, he pointed out the opportunities that deregulation presented to rural and regional areas, and I would recommend it to her.

  I thank the honourable member for Bennelong for the question. Like a previous member for Bennelong, he is very concerned about the sustainability of the budget. It is hugely important that we make sure that we live within our means as a government so that the decisions that are made tomorrow are not punitive for those most vulnerable. Our latest legacy of $667 billion of debt and budgets where there are no surpluses means that Australians are currently spending $1 billion a month on interest, with 70 per cent of it going overseas - and it is going to $3 billion. Of course, you have to be straight with the Australian people in dealing with this. You have to be honest with the Australian people in dealing with this, and we are being honest with the Australian people.                      Honesty comes as a great surprise to members of the Labor Party because, of course, they did say they were going to have four years of surplus. They continue to delude themselves that in fact the budget is fine; but, in fact, the member for Lilley himself, in a confession to still existing Senator Carr, apparently, said the budget situation is 'ruinous'. So there is a bit of hypocrisy there.                  There is a bit of hypocrisy from the Leader of the Opposition. If you came into this parliament today, you would think he was really concerned about the impacts of decisions on pensioners. But do you know what? It was about two years ago that he sidled up to me - just over there - and he begged me to help him to take 60,000 women off a single parents pension and put them on Newstart. Do you remember that, with the member for Jagajaga over there, because of the divisions in the Labor Party? Remember that: taking 60,000 single-income parents off a single parents pension? He knew about the divisions in the Labor Party. And then there were all these crocodile tears when they went into opposition - crocodile tears for single parents, crocodile tears from Labor, crocodile tears from the Leader of the Opposition.                      Oh yes, I got it wrong! He was the architect of it, with the member for Jagajaga. So the hypocrisy of the Labor Party is just a little bit overwhelming. They cry crocodile tears now about the fate of pensioners, yet when they were in government they did not hesitate to take people off a single parents pension and put them onto Newstart. Well, spare us the moment. We are the best friend Australian pensioners have ever had. We are their best friends, because we want the pension to be sustainable. We want it to be affordable. We want the pensioners of Australia to get a fair deal from the government, not just today but tomorrow. We will not cop the hypocrisy of this hypocrite!

  I was asked about payments to carers and there are no changes to payments to carers. I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that this is a government which is determined to protect the vulnerable people of this country, but it is also determined to ensure that Labor's debt and deficit disaster is addressed. As Reserve Bank board member John Edwards - the distinguished economist and friend of the Labor Party that the Labor Party appointed to the Reserve Bank Board - said: 'This is a budget crisis. It does need to be addressed.' It is going to be addressed by us in ways to protect the vulnerable.                      I simply repeat that there are no cuts to payments to carers. We made a series of commitments to carers pre-election and they will be kept. What we are doing in this budget is protecting the vulnerable; but, while protecting the vulnerable, we are doing what we were elected to do, which is to sort out Labor's debt and deficit disaster. If members opposite had any political integrity, they would tell us how they are going to deal with the debt and deficit disaster that they created.                      Members opposite are clearly uninterested in any response to their questions but let me give them one further nugget of information -                     The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                     The final piece of information that I should provide to members opposite - they probably do not want to be reminded of this - is that in 2008, in government, the Labor Party attempted to scrap the carers bonus. Does the Leader of the Opposition remember that?                      Does the Leader of the Opposition remember that?                     In 2008, the Labor Party was in government and the Leader of the Opposition, who was then a parliamentary secretary, attempted to scrap the carers bonus. They only failed to do that because the opposition successfully opposed it. I want to make it very clear that this government is the best friend that the carers of Australia have ever had.

  I want to praise the member Durack for being entirely consistent in her determination to get rid of the carbon tax and to get rid of the mining tax. Everyone on this side of the House is entirely consistent. There are no hypocrites over here; there are no people who go around the country and say one thing and then come into this place and do something else. Where would those people be, who go around and say things to the rest of Australia and then come into this place and do something else? There is always someone on the Labor side that bells the cat. We thought it was always going to be, in relation to the mining tax, the member for Perth, who has repeatedly said that the mining tax is just outrageous. Yet, the member for Perth keeps voting in here to keep it. So she is inconsistent. I would not say it is the act of a hypocrite - I would not say that - but I would say it is entirely inconsistent. Of course we can always rely on Senator Mark Bishop, from Western Australia, who said only yesterday, 'For Western Australia the mining tax is seen as coming from Canberra. It is seen as intrusive, it is seen as a cost. Whilst it can be seen as a cost with benefits if government raises significant revenue and spends it on things that government does, if it fails to receive any revenue at all people will simply ask, why are you doing that, what is the value?'                 We want to get rid of the mining tax. We want to get rid of the carbon tax. We are entirely consistent with the position that we took to the last election, and we want to get rid of these taxes because that is going to strengthen the Australian economy - it is going to deliver more jobs for everyday Australians and it is going to deliver greater prosperity. So we are entirely consistent. Unfortunately, the Labor Party is not. I seem to recall them saying they were going to terminate the carbon tax, yet they want to keep it. I thought they were embarrassed about the mining tax, as the Leader of the Opposition said to the Minerals Council and to the Business Council of Australia. He said don't worry, the mining tax was going to go - but he is voting to keep the mining tax. The Labor Party cry crocodile tears about pensioners but when they were in government they took the pension off 60,000 single mothers and now we know, in relation to carers, there is that same desperate inconsistency.                     The fundamental problem the Leader of the Opposition has is that they do not believe in anything - that is why they are inconsistent.

  I will expose Labor's lies this week and I will expose Labor's lies next week - it is as simple as that, and I will keep doing it week in and week out.                     Of course to assist the House I will withdraw. The claim that is being made is simply untrue - no budget ever brought down by members opposite when they were in government included this $80 billion figure. It was not in any of their budgets.                     It was not in any of their budgets because it was an undeliverable, pie in the sky promise that members opposite only made because they knew they would never be called upon to deliver it. Let me repeat, for the benefit of members opposite who seem to have truth deficit disorder, the facts.                     Hospital funding goes up nine per cent this year, nine per cent next year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent in the fourth year.                      School funding goes up eight per cent this year, eight per cent next year, eight per cent the year after that and six per cent the year after that. Every single year health spending goes up. Every single year education spending goes up. Spending is sustainable under this government, it was not sustainable under the members opposite.

  I thank the member for Casey for his question. He recognises how important the trucking industry is to the Australian economy and indeed his own local community, where there is substantial agribusiness in the wine industry, berries, apples and flowers, all of which require the trucking industry to bring them to market. So extra costs imposed on the trucking industry add to the costs of producers and of course increase the cost of living for consumers. The trucking industry has welcomed strongly this government's commitment to $50 billion worth of investments mainly in our national road system. They are also very pleased with the commitment for $248 million for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program and $565 million to fix up road black spots. All of these things help build a better road system. But if Labor were still in office the story would be very different today. They would be forcing legislation through the parliament this week to impose the carbon tax on the trucking industry, to add close to 7c a litre to their fuel costs, add to the cost of moving things around the nation, add to the costs of business and add to the costs of consumers.                  In addition, our government has not increased the road user charge this year - something Labor never did. They raised the road user charge every year on the trucking industry to add to their costs. But this government has not increased the road user charge and that is of enormous benefit to the industry.                     The reality is -                      The trucking industry on its own accord has reduced its emissions by 35 per cent, but that has not stopped Labor -                      Labor today -                    The member for Grayndler then left the chamber.                     Labor today are feigning concern about pensioners but it did not stop them from imposing a $550 per household impost on pensioners through their carbon tax. They were happy to carbon tax them but now they are not prepared -

  The tax in question is a Labor tax, which the Leader of the Opposition should remember.                     For the benefit of members opposite, who I think must have had a bad night at the ball because they are absolutely hysterical today, let me make two points. We are eliminating taxes. We are scrapping the carbon tax, we are scrapping the mining tax, and if members opposite would like us to keep that promise they can pass the legislation. We are reducing the tax burden. The overall tax burden reduces by $5 billion as a result of decisions taken by this government. So I am really pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has reminded people of what I said in 2012, because we have absolutely delivered on those commitments.

  I thank the member for Hughes for his question. The Australian government condemns in the strongest possible terms the actions of the extreme and brutal terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. ISIL's reported massacre of 1,700 Iraqi defence force personnel and attacks on civilians in Iraq are truly horrifying. The loss of life and the mass displacement of people in Iraqi is devastating. While we have not received a request for assistance from the Iraqi government, today I have announced $5 million in humanitarian aid to support the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing from the violence. Australia's assistance will be provided through the World Food Programme and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It will provide food, medical assistance, tents, access to clean water and hygiene kits to those displaced by this violence.                 Due to the deteriorating security situation, the Australian government has reduced staff numbers at our embassy in Baghdad, leaving only a core. We strongly urge Australians in Iraq to consider departing Iraq immediately, while commercial airlines are operating. Those Australians who choose to remain in Iraq should be aware that we have limited capacity to provide consular assistance.                 The government remains in close consultation with the government of Iraq and the United States, the United Kingdom and other partners. We are closely monitoring the situation to ensure that Australians are safe.                 We note the Iraqi government's efforts to counter terrorism and fight back against the forces of extremism. The government is deeply concerned that there are Australian citizens travelling to Syria, and we believe to Iraq, to fight with or support terrorist groups. This is against Australian law and, if they return to Australia, they will face the full force of our law. ISIL is listed as a terrorist organisation under Australian law. Our Criminal Code imposes strict penalties, including up to 25 years imprisonment for Australians involved with terrorist organisations.                 I have used my authority under the Australian Passports Act to cancel passports and refuse to issue passports, where the government suspects an individual poses a threat to our security. I repeat the government's warning that Australians must not engage with terrorist organisations - any terrorist organisations - anywhere in the world.

  I am delighted to get the last question of the day, and I am sure my colleagues will be very pleased as well that we are getting an opportunity to talk about higher education. The government's reforms to higher education spread opportunity to many more Australian students and will change the contribution that taxpayers and students make -                      from the current sixty-forty arrangements to fifty-fifty, which we think is a fair and reasonable contribution for students to make. I would like to read a letter I received from Graeme Mitchell, a graduate of the University of Western Sydney. It very much encapsulates exactly what the government is trying to achieve through our higher education reforms: 'My father died in my second-last year at high school. I lost all interest in education and bombed out. My then deputy principal told me and several colleagues we were dills and would never amount to much. I had to get a job to help support my family. My dad's death, my deputy principal's expressed opinion of me and the dead-end job I was obliged to take did nothing for my self-worth. I drifted from one dead-end job to another. In my 40s I became aware of HECS and applied for uni entry as a mature-age student, not thinking for a moment that I would make it, but I did. I graduated second in my course, in the top one per cent of all faculties, and won several outstanding-student awards. My academic achievement gave my self-worth an enormous boost. My degree got me a much better job and income, and I had the satisfaction of paying something back to the society that had supported me through uni. My HECS contribution was a pittance compared to my post-degree income.'                 Graeme writes: 'My advice to uni students is to accept the generous contribution taxpayers make to your education and not look at HECS as a government imposed tax but look at the satisfaction -                      of having personally paid for some of it themselves.' Who could disagree with that? Who could disagree with Graeme Mitchell's stated remarks? He understands the transformative impact of higher education. Rather than whinge, moan and complain about being asked to contribute to his own higher education, he pulled himself up from the bootstraps, got himself the higher education qualifications he needed and massively increased his income and his self-worth.                 The government is trying to reform higher education so that tens of thousands more Graeme Mitchells around Australia in places like Western Sydney in the member for Lindsay's electorate get the opportunity to do exactly what Graeme Mitchell did. Rather than caterwauling, interrupting and showing the crassness that the Labor Party exhibits, they should be thanking people like Graeme Mitchell because he is one of the salt-of-the-earth Australians that we want to hold up as heroes.

  This government was elected to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster, and fix it we will. I would be very reluctant to accept the figures in the Leader of the Opposition's question because the Leader of the Opposition has a bit of a record of misleading people.                     Let me point out to the House that under this government people will continue to receive generous social security benefits.                     The difference is that under this government it will be sustainable. Under members opposite it was not sustainable. Just to give you a couple of examples, a single-income household with a child with $30,000 in private income will continue to receive some $18,000 from the taxpayer under this government if the child is under six. A similar household earning $90,000 will continue to receive some $6,000 from the taxpayer. This is a government which appreciates that families are doing it tough and, if members opposite are fair dinkum about doing the right thing by the families of Australia, repeal the carbon tax and do it now.

  I do thank the member for Brisbane for her question. Families and businesses right around Australia cannot wait to see this carbon tax scrapped.                      I was at a business this morning, Oxford Coal Storage in Melbourne. It has 400 employees and a $60,000 a month carbon tax, a bill that cascades right throughout the economy because this is one of the biggest food distributors in our country. So right around Australia every business is hit by the carbon tax. Every household is hit by the carbon tax, and the best thing this parliament can do right now for the businesses and the families of Australia is scrap the carbon tax.                 This government was elected to do certain specific things. We were elected to stop the boats. We were elected to build the roads of the 21st century.                  We were elected to get the budget back under control and, above all else, we were elected to scrap the carbon tax. If last year's election was about anything, it was a referendum on the carbon tax, and the answer of the Australian people was absolutely clear - scrap this toxic tax! It is a nine per cent impost on the price of power. It is a $9 billion a year handbrake on our economy. It is a $550 a year hit on households. This toxic tax must go, and it will go under this government. If the carbon tax stays, by midcentury our steel production will be down 20 per cent, our aluminium production will be down by 60 per cent, our gross national income per person will be down by $4,000. There will be a cumulative $1 trillion reduction in Australia's GDP. This is an economic disaster, and it is all the fault of members opposite.                 Today legislation to scrap the carbon tax was reintroduced into this House of Parliament. Shortly, this legislation will be considered by the Senate and soon members opposite will have to say where they stand on this tax. Before the election they said they wanted to terminate the carbon tax. Well, they have their chance to terminate the carbon tax.                     Vote to scrap this toxic tax in this House in a few days time.

  This is the government which is determined to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Unlike members opposite, we do not live in some kind of fairyland where there is some kind of budget fix based on fiddling the books and cooking the figures.                     We do not live in that kind of a fairyland. We have explained to the Australian people exactly what we are going to do to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. We have explained what we are going to do to do.                     I see the member for Grayndler is attempting to support the Leader of the Opposition for once! But we have explained -                      We have been open and up-front with the Australian people about what we are going to do to deal with the situation created by members opposite -                       - whereby this country is paying $1 billion every single month. We are paying $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on Labor's borrowings. That is what we are doing. We have been very up-front with the Australian people about what we are doing to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster.                     Now members opposite should have the honesty and the integrity to tell us what they are doing to deal with the debt and deficit disaster that they created.

  I thank the honourable member for Parkes for the question. He has every right to be concerned about the impact of carbon tax on Australian airlines. It adds to the cost of aircraft flying around the countryside. It makes it more difficult for people to go about their business. It makes it more difficult for country people, in particular, to go to the city when they need medical treatment or to attend to day-to-day activities. The impact of the carbon tax on these costs is having a major impact on the airlines themselves. We have heard members opposite talking about wanting to look after Qantas and Virgin and wanting to make sure that we have strong airlines in Australia. But how do they go about it? By imposing upon them a tax that airlines in other parts of the world do not pay. By imposing on them a penalty which makes it more difficult for them to get about their business. It makes it more difficult for them to trade profitably and to employ Australians.                     This is Labor's response. This is Labor's way to help aviation in this country. It adds to their direct costs through fuel, and, of course, it also adds to their indirect costs. It makes it more expensive for many businesses to operate and, therefore, they fly less. All of that is bad news for the aviation sector. This financial year, the report shows that Qantas has already had to pay $114 million in carbon tax, whilst Virgin has paid $54.5 million and Rex has paid $2.3 million. This is at a time when the airlines are losing money and reporting negative balance sheets. They are talking about running at a loss and having to lay people off. Labor says it wants to help. Well, vote to get rid of the carbon tax! Get rid of the carbon tax and give our airlines a fair go. Give them an opportunity to trade profitably again and to provide services to the Australian people. There is a simple way for Labor to help the airlines. Take the advice of John Borghetti, who said that the best thing the government could do to make a difference to the airline industry was to remove the carbon tax. Here is your chance. Get on with it. Vote to get rid of the carbon tax.

  This government was absolutely crystal clear before the election that we would tackle Labor's debt and deficit disaster.                     We were absolutely crystal clear that we would tackle Labor's debt and deficit disaster.                     A single-income family with two dependants aged under six -                       -  A single-income family with two dependants aged under six on $60,000 a year will receive $12,630 a year from the taxpayer.                     A single-income household with two dependants under six will get $12,630 from the taxpayer. What this illustrates is that people will continue to receive generous social service support under this government. The difference is that our social security system is sustainable under this government.                     It was completely unsustainable under members opposite, and if -                      If members opposite are fair dinkum about looking after the families of Australia, they have an opportunity to do something this week in the parliament: vote to scrap the carbon tax.                 The Leader of the Opposition, who loudly interjects across the table, who cannot help himself when it comes to chattering across the table -                      The Leader of the Opposition ran around the country claiming that he would terminate the carbon tax.                     The Leader of the Opposition liked to stand up before the election and say that he would terminate the carbon tax. He has an opportunity to be the terminator -                    The member for McMahon then left the chamber.                     and vote, to make an honest politician of himself. Vote to terminate the carbon tax in this parliament this week.

  I do thank the member for Kennedy for his question. Like other Queensland members, particularly members from North Queensland, such as the member for Leichardt, the member for Capricornia, the member for Maranoa, the member for Flynn, the member for Herbert and the member for Dawson - there is an absolute litany of them; in fact, all of the North Queensland members put their hands up, please - all of them want to see the mining sector flourish, and all of them want to see infrastructure improve.                     I will tell you what the government are doing to help the mining sector to flourish: we are scrapping the carbon tax and we are scrapping the mining tax. We do not treat coal as a pariah, as members opposite, thanks to their alliance with the Greens, are doing. The Greens are telling members opposite to treat coal as a pariah. This government will never treat coal as a pariah industry. We want it to expand. We want employment and investment in the coal industry to expand. That is why we want to scrap the carbon tax and scrap the mining tax. If members opposite were serious about giving the coal industry a future, they too would vote to terminate the carbon tax.                 The other thing we want to do is boost our infrastructure.                     I am thrilled to say, as the infrastructure Prime Minister, that in this budget some $50 billion in Commonwealth money is committed to infrastructure of the 21st century, including freight rail. This is the biggest infrastructure spend in Commonwealth history, in this budget. We are doing everything we reasonably can to boost the coal industry of North Queensland and to boost the infrastructure of North Queensland.

  I particularly want to note that the member for Braddon campaigned at the last election on the basis of lowering the cost of living. As a consequence of that, he secured -                      one of the largest swings in Australia. He campaigned on the basis of cost of living. So far we have heard a series of questions from our friends on the opposition benches today about cost of living. If you would like to do something about cost of living, bills were introduced today which would deliver a $550 a year reduction in the cost of living - right now, an immediate reduction in the cost of living. On that front -                      not only is there a provision for the ACCC to ruthlessly pursue anybody who fails to pass on the electricity and gas price reductions, but regulators are already making decisions. I want to take the release of the Tasmanian Economic Regulator from 19 June. The Tasmanian Economic Regulator came to a very interesting conclusion. The regulator authorised a reduction of 7.8 per cent in the bills faced by Tasmanians today for their electricity. This is not a failure to increase; this is an actual reduction of 7.8 per cent. That is what Tasmanian families will receive if they have the carbon tax bills passed. The regulator went on to say that this is 'as a result of the energy market's expectation that the carbon price will be removed with retrospective effect from 1 July 2014'. But it is not just in Tasmania. In Queensland, the regulator has set down lower prices. In New South Wales, the gas regulator has set down lower prices. In the ACT, it is 11.6 per cent reduction compared with what would otherwise have been the case.                 When we look at the private sector, over recent days we have had Origin, Alinta and Energy Australia all say that electricity prices would be lower and the full cost of the carbon tax would be passed through. Only an hour ago we saw AGL put out a release saying they will pass through the full cost of the carbon tax once the bills passed.                     In other words, the question then is: who is standing in the way of lower electricity bills for Australian families? Each and every one of those members on the opposite side. It is not the crossbenchers; it is the Leader of the Opposition and it is the members of the Labor Party who profess to care about the cost of living and who then vote for higher electricity prices. If you want to do something, get out of the way and support repeal.

  Members opposite think that government could just go on borrowing and borrowing to pay benefits but the country simply could not afford it.                     The spending spree of the Labor Party means that every single Australian -                      including the family that the shadow minister referred to in her question, is contributing to $1 billion a month - in dead money - in interest repayments on Labor's borrowing. This is the difficulty that eventually had to be tackled and it has been tackled by this government. This is a government which has had the decency and the honesty to face up to the debt and deficit disaster that we inherited from the former government, from members opposite.                     Members opposite need to get real and they need to understand that we cannot and could not go on forever on borrowed money.                     We simply could not go on under the policies of members opposite borrowing more and more every month because we were going deeper and deeper into deficit every month. This government has taken the tough decisions. We have made the hard decisions necessary to get the budget back under control and to bring the budget back into balance within four years. Someone had to do it. Members opposite have proven incapable of doing it. This government has done what this country needed to be done.                 Notwithstanding all the changes that this government has made, we will continue to have a generous social security system. A sole parent with two dependents aged six to 13 years earning $60,000 a year in 2016-17 will get $8,348 from the taxpayer in social security benefits. So we are continuing to generously support the vulnerable families of this country. That is what the people expect of us, but we have got to do it in ways which are sustainable - and that was never going to happen under members opposite.

  I am pleased to get a question from the member for Macarthur on higher education reforms because I can tell him that our higher education reforms will create a great deal more freedom in the university sector in Australia -                      allowing them to compete not only domestically amongst themselves for students but also compete internationally against those universities in Asia that are ever improving the quality of their offerings. So not only are we protecting a $15-billion a year international education market but we are also giving our Australian students a great deal more opportunity to go to university. In fact, should our reforms be passed, 80,000 more young Australians will get the opportunity to get a higher education qualification by lifting the demand-driven system cap that currently exists for sub-bachelor degrees and by expanding the Commonwealth grant scheme to non-university higher education providers.                 The fact that competition is good for the uni sector has been recognised by that Paul Wellings, the vice-chancellor of Wollongong University.                     He writes 'after all those years when the sector was controlled by volume and price, we should be celebrating the chance to do it differently'. So the uni sector gets it, and this government gets it: more competition is good for students, more competition is good for diversity and will allow our universities to compete.                 But I am also asked by the member for Macarthur: should competition be an end in itself? Most people would agree that while competition is good, it can be taken too far. Some people call the member for Grayndler and the member for Maribyrnong 'the people's choice versus the factions' choice'; but at the moment they are being a bit more like the mongoose and the cobra. If you read this morning's Australian you will see what Troy Bramston has written there; he talks about their politics being those of absolute disunity. Disunity is death in Australian politics.                     I was making the point that the university sector gets that competition is good for higher education; it is good for students and it is good for them to have the opportunity to compete with their Asian counterparts and amongst each other. But I was also making the point that competition can be taken too far when it becomes so destructive as it has - so poisonous - between the people's choice and the faction's choice. It becomes very destructive. I was shocked to see that it said -                      Albanese is undermining Shorten's focus on policy, strategy, presentation and party reform. I thought: 'What else is there?' What is he good at - carrying the drinks? Handing the coats?                     I will, Madam Speaker. The only bows the member for Grayndler is interested in are the ones that carry arrows into the back of the Leader of the Opposition, unfortunately.                 In this week of anniversaries -                      I will, Madam Speaker. Most of my time has gone, so I am happy to conclude my answer.

  I can confirm that we will keep the commitments that we made before the election and one of the commitments that we made was that we were scrapping the schoolkids bonus, because the schoolkids bonus is a cash splash with borrowed money. That is the problem. Members opposite think that you can keep spending money this country does not have and has to borrow, running up ruinous bills for our children and grandchildren to pay. We are not ripping off our children and our grandchildren. We are not mortgaging this country's future to sustain present spending. We are not. We are being absolutely responsible -                      and we are implementing the policies we were straight enough with the Australian people - up-front enough with the Australian people - to take to the election, like abolishing the schoolkids bonus, a cash splash with borrowed money.                 For the benefit of the shadow minister who asked the question, a single-income couple where one of the parents earns an income of $60,000 a year and the other does not earn an income, with two dependents aged six to 13, will continue to receive, in the year 2016-17, $8,348 from the taxpayer. The difference between the payments we will make and the payments members opposite were promising to make is that our payments can be relied upon because our social security system is sustainable in a way that of the members opposite simply was not.

  I thank the member very much for her question. I thank her for the work that she is doing, in particular, with FASD. She is very mindful of the threat of alcohol to parents and the dangers of the consumption of alcohol, particularly during the stages of pregnancy and especially in Indigenous communities. She is to be commended for that work.                 In this budget, we have provided a way forward for the Australian community to continue to enjoy a sustainable Medicare system for decades ahead. But the Labor Party, as the Prime Minister pointed out before, live in this fairyland where, on the one hand, they are promising another $16 billion for the foreign aid budget in this country. They have no idea where that money will come from. They are promising to slug Australian families when it comes the continuation of the carbon tax.                     They are promising money for families that this country just does not have. We know that, 10 years ago, we were spending $8 billion a year on Medicare. We will spend $20 billion this year on Medicare and it will continue to rise each and every year in this budget. It has risen by 42 per cent over the course of the last five years alone. I want, the government wants and the Australian population wants to make sure we can keep Medicare sustainable with an ageing population, with chronic diseases and diseases of the brain which will mean that by 2050, 7,500 Australians will be diagnosed each week with dementia and Alzheimer's in this country. We have to address those costs as they are incurred over the coming decades.                 In this budget we propose to build a $20 billion capital guaranteed medical research fund that the Labor Party will never be able to spend down but from which we will be able to derive $1 billion in income each year to supplement the $750 million or $800 million a year that we spend on medical research today. When Labor were in government they spent down every capital fund that they had, but we will ensure that this fund is protected.                 To fund that, we propose to keep bulk-billing but to have a $7 co-payment that, for those people who cannot afford to pay the $7 co-payment, is at the doctor's discretion, as it applies today, so we will take care of those who are most in need. But we will say to those Australians who have a capacity to pay the $7 that, yes, we want you to contribute that $7 because we cannot afford as a country to continue with 263 million free services under Medicare, as we did last year. Yes, we will provide for those that do not have a capacity to pay the $7, but out of the $7 we will put $5 into the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund and the $2 will be contributed to doctors and healthcare providers to supplement the money that they receive under Medicare now. It will mean a $500 million windfall for those doctors and healthcare providers. That is what we will do to keep Medicare sustainable.

  The best thing that I can do for the workers of Oxford Cold Storage -                      and for workers in businesses right around Australia is to try to ensure that those businesses remain profitable, because if you cannot make a profit you cannot survive and if you do not survive there is no employment and there are no workers. This government gets it in a way that members opposite never did. You cannot have strong communities without a strong economy to sustain them and you cannot have a strong economy without profitable private businesses. We get that; members opposite do not. That is why they loaded up private businesses with the carbon tax, with the mining tax, with endless regulations -                      The point I am making is that the best thing that we can do the workers of Australia is to try to ensure that their businesses can flourish, because if the businesses can flourish the workers can continue to be employed and can enjoy the higher wages that everyone wants to see workers in this country earn. More profitable businesses are more productive businesses; more productive businesses have higher paid workers. We get that; members opposite do not. That is why they loaded up the businesses of Australia with the mining tax, with the carbon tax, with more regulation and green tape. We want to see all of those go.                 The Leader of the Opposition asked me about workers earning $50,000. Let me explain for the Leader of the Opposition's benefit that, under the budget that this government has brought down, if you are a sole parent, with one child aged under six, earning $50,000 in 2016-17 you will receive $11,705 in social security support.                 The difference between this government and members opposite is that we support the businesses employing the workers and we want the social security system to be sustainable for the long run. We understand, in a way that members opposite do not, that you cannot continue to pay money that you haven't got. You cannot continue to saddle up future generations with ever-expanding debt to pay for today's consumption. You cannot do that. Members opposite should really wake up to themselves. We have explained how we will sort out Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Members opposite need to do the same.

  I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. I quote from the member for O'Connor's maiden speech last year where he said, when describing his electorate:                 Small business is the beating heart of O'Connor _ that provides the jobs and opportunities for the future.                 The member for O'Connor is working extremely hard to provide that future for those small businesses in the face of the legacy that Labor left. He knows, we on this side know, that that beating heart - which includes agriculture, horticulture, timber, tourism, fishing, gold, nickel and iron ore operations - depends on the next generation of trades people to fill those jobs, to push that economy along and to make sure that we have the production and the productivity we need to make this country great. That is why this government is investing $1.9 billion in trade support loans to make sure that we have apprentices who target the skills that industry needs and wants.                 The loans that we are providing through the Trade Support Loans scheme will target the National Skills Needs List, which includes many of the priorities that cover the businesses in the seat of O'Connor. As well as the obvious ones - as I have mentioned, mining is of huge importance in the seat of O'Connor - there are also priority qualifications that cover beef and cattle production, dairy and irrigation, wool classing and horse breeding, just to name a few of the 100, which just shows that, across the board in a whole range of traineeships and trades, the Trade Support Loans will be welcomed by the community, who have already provided the feedback to my office and, I am sure, to the member for O'Connor on just how good these Trade Support Loans are - just how much better they are than the old Tools for Your Trade scheme.                 I know the member for Cunningham is coming around. I know in time - it will take time - she will come around, because this is a much better option. It gives young people who do a four-year apprenticeship around $12,000, along with the cash in hand, so they have more money sooner to cover their costs of living. Of course, their challenge is to make sure there are jobs there for them, and industry's challenge is that as well. Of course, the best thing to make sure there are jobs there for them is to make sure those industries prosper.                 What is happening in Western Australia is that, last year, Western Australia paid $600 million in carbon tax, straight into the black hole. If we want to make sure these people have jobs, the Labor Party should get rid of the carbon tax.

  We were absolutely up-front that we were eliminating the schoolkids bonus and we were absolutely up-front that we were going to tackle the debt and deficit disaster.                   The member for Gellibrand then left the chamber.                     As for fuel excise indexation, that was a policy that was introduced by members opposite and it is a policy which has been resumed by this government. It is a policy that was introduced by members opposite -                    The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     So it comes passing strange for members opposite to be complaining about fuel excise indexation when it is a Labor tax. It is a Labor tax that was invented by the Labor Party and it has been restored by this government as a revenue measure. It will cost the average family some 40c a week in the coming financial year.                 I accept that there have been some tough decisions in this budget. I accept that. I accept that this government has made some hard choices in this budget. We had to make tough decisions. We had to make hard choices because members opposite consistently shirked the tough decisions, the necessary decisions, that were needed to sort out the debt and deficit disaster that they themselves had created.                 But I say to the member who asked the question that, if you are a single income earner on $60,000 a year with three dependents, one aged under six and two aged between six and 13, you will continue to receive $17,920 a year from the social security system.                     The difference between this government and members opposite is that this government wants all workers' jobs to be more secure. That is why we are -                      scrapping job-destroying, economy-wrecking taxes, and we want the social security system to be sustainable. A social security system that is run on borrowed money simply is not sustainable. We are fixing Labor's debt and deficit disaster. We have explained to the Australian people how we will fix the debt and deficit disaster that we inherited. It is high time that Labor explained what they will do to address the debt and deficit disaster that they created.

  I thank the member for Bonner for his question and I thank the many members on this side of the House who continue to show an interest in this topic, because there have not been any questions from those opposite now for more than 100 days on the issue of border protection either to me or to the Prime Minister. So it would seem, as I have said before, that the success we are having in stopping the boats is stopping the questions as well from those who sit opposite. And I am not surprised because anytime they may dare to ask a question -                      Is it my lucky day? Is it? Is it? Any day they seek to ask a question in this place there will be the opportunity to remind those opposite of their hopeless failure while they were in government.                 On this issue, it is true that Labor left behind a mess on our borders, but they also left behind more than 30,000 people, more than half of those who arrived on their watch, without processing them. Twenty three thousand of them they did not even commence processing. So I found it strange on the weekend that the member for Corio said that we needed to start processing people. Where was he from August 2012 to the election in September 2013? Completely absent, I am sure.                 But we are getting on with the job, and the way we are getting on with the job is that, first of all, you do not add to the problem. What you do is you do not add to the problem, and we have not had a successful venture for people smugglers in over six months. But the next thing you do is you start to process them. We put in place temporary protection visas, which were disallowed by Labor and the - is this is a question? Is it? Is there a chance?                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. We put in place temporary protection visas which were disallowed by Labor and the Greens - exactly what they did back in 2008. And guess what happened after it - 50,000 people turned up on 800 boats and almost 1,200 people died. On the weekend we still heard the shadow minister unrepentant about the fact that they do not think temporary protection visas have anything to do with this proposition. What those opposite need to understand is: this government will not provide permanent visas to those who arrived illegally by boat. It will not happen - not ever. And if you want to try me on it, you try me on it. The people smugglers have tried this government on these issues and they have failed, and we are prevailing. If you want to try to intimidate this side on border protection, do your best, because you will fail. This government will not buckle on our borders. We will not buckle to people smugglers; we will not roll over to the chanting and choruses that come from around the country calling on people to roll back border protection measures. We know the Labor Party will do it; we know the Labor Party will do it every time. But this government will never buckle on our borders - ever.

  I have the budget papers before me. I have got a dual-income couple on a 70-30 income split, with two dependants aged under six, earning $60,000, and they will receive $10,067 a year through the social security system in 2016-17. Under this government people will continue to receive generous social security benefits. The difference is that under this government they will be sustainable. Under members opposite, they were being paid for by borrowed money. They were mortgaging our children's and our grandchildren's future so that they could big-note themselves with handouts. That is what they were doing. When it comes to -                      I just make the point to the shadow minister: why is it right to have a PBS co-payment and somehow wrong to have a Medicare co-payment?                     She can interject, but it would actually be nice to have from members opposite a clear rationale. Why is it right to have a PBS co-payment and somehow wrong to have a Medicare co-payment, especially when Bob Hawke was the father and the member for Jagajaga was the mother of the co-payment and the member for Fraser is the child of the co-payment?                     I know that members opposite do not like being reminded of the fact that former Prime Minister Bob Hawke brought in a co-payment and the current shadow minister for families supported a co-payment, and the Labor shadow Treasurer down there supports a co-payment. But let us just repeat what the member for Fraser thinks:                 _ there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all _ the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc. And the idea is hardly radical.                 So I say to the member who asked the question: your argument is not with me; your argument is with your own Assistant Treasurer. You persuade the Shadow Assistant Treasurer that a co-payment is a bad idea, and then I will start to listen to you.

  I thank the member for Forde his question. The government is gravely concerned by the fact that Australian citizens are heading to Iraq and Syria not only to fight but to take leadership roles in radicalising others in these conflicts. This is one of the most disturbing developments in our domestic security in quite some time.                 There are approximately 150 Australian citizens who we believe are linked to extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - an organisation that has been defined by its savagery and its brutality. There is a real danger that these extremists will come back home as trained terrorists and pose a threat to our security. The Australian government condemns terrorism in the strongest possible terms and is taking firm steps to respond to this terrorist threat.                 Our intelligence agencies are working closely with partners in the Middle East, South-East Asia, Europe and the United States to monitor this extremist activity and to track those, including Australians, who are travelling to Syria and Iraq. We have listed ISIL and other terrorist organisations under our Criminal Code. There are strong penalties, including imprisonment of up to 25 years for a range of terrorist offences.                 Any Australian found to be engaged with these terrorist organisations will be arrested, detained and prosecuted. Under the Australian Passports Act I have the authority to cancel or refuse to issue a passport where we suspect an individual is a threat to the security of Australia. In the past few months I have cancelled a substantial number of passports on security grounds, and I continue to do so.                 We are considering other measures that can be taken to combat this escalating terrorist threat. I can assure the member for Forde and the members of this House and the Australian public that the Australian government is absolutely committed to the security of this nation and to keeping Australians safe.

  Childcare payments are not going down. They are not. They are not going down, but I do make the observation that members opposite, when they were in government, froze the childcare rebate. They froze the childcare rebate. Members opposite, when they were in government, promised 260 childcare centres to end the double drop-off and they delivered only 38. Wasn't it right that only 38 out of 260 were actually delivered?                     How can a point of order be taken on this? I am exactly answering her question.                     I repeat: when members opposite were in government they froze the childcare rebate and this government has done no more than what the former government was prepared to do with benefits in this area. If it was right for the former government to do things like freeze the rebate, why isn't it right for this government, likewise, to do what it has done.                  I do say that, for all the histrionics that we are getting from the shadow minister who asked the question, members opposite have an absolutely hopeless record. They promised 260 childcare centres to end the dreaded double drop. Remember that? They promised to end the double drop with 260 childcare centres; 38 is all they built.                  Under members opposite, childcare costs increased by 53 per cent - 53 per cent! We want to see a better childcare system. We want to ensure that our childcare spending gets the maximum possible benefits to our community and to our economy. That is why we have a Productivity Commission inquiry. As for Paid Parental Leave, all this government wants is for the same sort of system that currently applies to public servants, who get paid at their wage - the same fairness that members opposite think should apply to public servants - to apply to everyone, because if it is right for public servants it is right for the rest of our community.                 I do not see why members opposite should want a better deal for public servants than they want for the ordinary battling, struggling workers of this country. What is fair for public servants is fair for everyone. That is why this government supports a fair dinkum Paid Parental Leave scheme.

  I thank the member for Pearce for that question, because he understands the importance of the government's work to stop people smuggling and therefore save lives. He also knows that people smuggling is a very evil and resilient crime. It is engaged in by sophisticated criminal gangs who operate internationally and is solely driven by the enormous profit on offer.                  Many smuggling activities are organised by criminal networks that are also involved in other crime types such as drug trafficking, money laundering, document fraud and arms smuggling. In six years in government the Labor Party reinvigorated the people-smuggling trade and then they utterly failed to stop or deter the organised criminal networks that are responsible.                  They did absolutely nothing for six years apart from pursuing policies that encouraged chaos and leniency. Whilst in government they even directed the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions not to prosecute certain people-smuggling types. This obvious weakness served to do only one thing: to embolden people-smuggling gangs, and that led to record people-smuggling enterprises and record illegal boat arrivals.                 But I am pleased to report to the House that, unlike Labor's failed policies, the Abbott government, since coming to office, has resolved to aggressively pursue people smugglers, and they have been very effective in doing so.                 I can confirm that on Friday, after a very long operation, the Australian Federal Police charged a man who was alleged to have smuggled people into our country. The 42-year-old was formally charged in Perth following his extradition from Germany. The arrest followed a substantial investigation by the Australian Federal Police in conjunction with its international law enforcement partners, particularly in Germany and through Interpol.                  The Abbott government is committed to undermining the business models of these sophisticated and deadly organised criminal syndicates, and I congratulate the Australian Federal Police and their international partners for the work that they have done in facilitating this arrest. Unlike Labor, our policies have seen the dangerous practice of people smuggling by boat stopped. The government's Operation Sovereign Borders has proved to be extremely effective, with no successful people-smuggling arrivals for six months. I congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection for the success that he has achieved.                 The message to people smugglers under the Abbott government is very clear: we will pursue you wherever you are in the world, and we will bring you to justice with the full force of Australian law.

  Australia simply could not go on as we were, under the former government, borrowing more and more every year, loading up our children and our grandchildren with an ever-increasing debt. Right now, because of the policies of the former government, every Australian is paying a billion dollars every single month.                      We are contributing our share to the billion dollars that the Commonwealth is paying every single month -                      just to pay the interest on Labor's borrowings and, under the policies of members opposite, within a decade it would have been $3 billion a month. We simply could not go on like this. Every year of deficit takes us deeper into debt, and every year the debt goes up the interest bill just increases. It just goes up and up and up and up.                  That the member for Lilley be excused from the service of the House.                   A division having                    been called and the bells being                    rung -

  I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to respond to the question from the member for Corio. Next year's migration program has been set to ensure that we focus on skilled migration. We are ensuring that more than two-thirds of the intake for next year will be for skilled migrants because the best way to ensure the cohesion of our society through our migration program is to focus on skilled migration. One of the great achievements of the Howard government was to ensure that we reversed the low level of skilled intake that we had under the Hawke and Keating governments, which fell to less than 30 per cent. It went to as high as 70 per cent under the Howard government.                  I note that that was one of the things that the previous government did not change. If only they took that approach to other immigration policies of the Howard government. But on the matter that the member has raised, it is true: we have decided to increase the number of places available for the contributing parent scheme. We have done that by reducing the number for the non-contributing parent visa scheme, because under our migration program we invite people into the country who are able to come and to pay their way. We maintain a program -                      I was saying, in my answer to the specific question put to me, that we have increased the number of places for the contributing parents scheme, and we have reduced the number of places for the non-contributing scheme.                     It has not gone to zero, at all, as opposition members who are interjecting know. They know little about these matters. Under our program we ensure that we encourage people to come to Australia the right way, we stop people who are trying to come the wrong way - something the previous government could not do - and we ensure that there is a program that is fair and balanced and continues to build on the success of Australia's immigration program.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. I can assure her that scrapping the carbon tax will indeed be good for the people of Capricornia. It will certainly help the mining industry because the carbon tax is designed to make the price of coal prohibitive. It will certainly help the trucking industry, because under members opposite, there was going to be an extra carbon tax hit on the trucking industry from 1 July. It will help the cattle industry, because abattoirs are some of the businesses hit hardest by the carbon tax. But above all else, it will help the households of Capricornia by giving them a $550 a year bonus. That is what scrapping the carbon tax will do. The carbon tax is a nine per cent impost on power prices.                     It is a $9 billion handbrake on our economy, as well as being a $550 a year hit on the households of Australia. That is why it must go -                      and that is why, if this parliament is serious about helping the struggling families of this country, it will get rid of this carbon tax this week. Without the carbon tax, the aluminium industry will be 60 per cent bigger; the iron industry will be 20 per cent bigger. Without the carbon tax our cumulative GDP by 2050 will be one trillion dollars greater. Without the carbon tax, our gross national income per person will be nearly $5,000 a year higher by the middle of this century. That is why abolishing the carbon tax is a massive economic reform. If we are serious about reforming our economy we will get rid of the carbon tax and we will get rid of the carbon tax this week.                 Only one thing stands in the way of getting rid of the carbon tax and that, of course, is the federal opposition and its leader. Not only does the Labor Party want to keep the carbon tax, they want it to go up. They want it to go up on 1 July by five per cent. How shameful. This is the Leader of the Opposition -                      who said, before the election, that he wanted to terminate the carbon tax. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: be the terminator. Do not be the vacillator. Do not be the procrastinator. Do not be the fabricator. Be the terminator and get rid of this toxic tax this week. You are the only one standing in the way of Australian -                      families earning $550 a year more.

  I am pleased that those opposite have discovered the immigration program. I am pleased that they decided to raise these matters in the House today. What those opposite do not seem to understand -                      You have asked your question; you could give courtesy to the response. You have asked the question; you might learn something.                     Under the family program there are a range of visas that have waiting lists that range from four years to 16 years. One of the cruellest things you can do to people in the immigration program -                      is ask them to make an application when you know there is no possibility that they are going to see their case heard and determined, and a visa possibly granted. So what the government has decided to do is not keep charging people for visa applications, when the waiting list on these visas is so long that we would start to work through the backlog of claims that the previous lot were unable to work through.                     That is why the current claims for a number of family visas have been suspended until we can work through the backlog. This will enable us to get through the backlog more quickly and address the applications that are already in the system before we start inviting other applications. We are not going to go out and not be fair dinkum with people. We are not going to tell them, 'Make an application and pay your money and your visa's going to get processed.' So until we can get over the backlog that the ill administration of the previous government was responsible for, we will deal with people in an up-front way.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. Maranoa is one of the biggest electorates in Australia, and so a carbon tax on transport, as proposed by Labor, will add massively to the cost of doing business in Maranoa.                     The trucking industry has estimated that Labor's carbon tax will add half a billion dollars a year -                      to the cost of transport across the nation. But it is not just the big industries that are affected by the carbon tax. It affects every aspect of our lives. For instance, in Maranoa, the Western Downs council owns the Carinya Aged Persons Hostel in Miles and the Tarcoola Retirement Hostel in Tara. Their electricity bill is estimated, with carbon tax, to be $127,000 - a bill for the small towns of Tara and Miles to pay. It is $127,000 because of Labor's carbon tax.                 Labor also said their carbon tax was not going to apply to agriculture. But the Australian Farm Institute has done some work on the impact of the increase in energy costs on inputs for the farm sector, and the carbon tax is already costing beef producers $2,000 a year. It is about $5,000 a year for grain growers and $9,000 for cotton production. So the reality is that farmers, who are supposed to be exempt from the carbon tax, are already paying dearly for this imposition by the Labor Party.                 The facts are that if, as the Prime Minister just said, parliament does not repeal the carbon tax this week it goes up from $24.15 a tonne to $25.40 a tonne - an increase applied automatically as a result of Labor's legislation. Labor told us that this was the way for Australia to pay a fair share of the cost of dealing with global carbon emissions. But what is fair about Australia paying $25.40 per tonne when New Zealand pays $3.71 a tonne, or Europe $8.00 a tonne? Our carbon price next week is going to be three times the price of Europe's and seven times the price of New Zealand's, and, of course, our carbon tax is much more invasive than any other carbon tax around the world. It applies to much more of our economy, so the impact on Australia from Labor's carbon tax is affecting our competitiveness and our ability to provide jobs and opportunities for the people in Australia. This $9 billion hit on jobs must go, and the parliament needs to respond to that in the few days that are left.

  The seniors of Australia are very sensible people, and they know that governments, like businesses and like families, simply cannot continue to live beyond their means; that governments, like families and like businesses, should not be in the business of trying to deliver a cash splash with borrowed money. That is what the seniors of Australia understand.                 The seniors of Australia, I believe, understand that this government was elected to deal with the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite created - a debt and deficit disaster embracing the six biggest deficits in Australia's history, $123 billion of prospective cumulative deficits over just four years, a debt projected to peak at $667 billion and an interest bill of $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on Labor's existing borrowings. That is what the seniors of Australia understand. They understand that unless remedial action was taken, every single Australian would be saddled with a Commonwealth debt bill the equivalent of $25,000 per man, woman and child.                     That is the debt burden that members opposite saddled this country with. The seniors of Australia get it, unlike members opposite.                     They realise that they cannot keep living beyond their means, and that is why I am confident that the seniors of Australia - and the people of Australia generally - appreciate that this government had to take some tough decisions. We really did have to take some tough decisions, and some of those tough decisions involved saying no more cash splashes with borrowed money.

  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, and, in particular, thank you to the member for Deakin. I remember during the last campaign walking with the now member for Deakin through Ringwood, Blackburn and Mitcham, where he went from shop to shop and house to house -                      campaigning to reduce electricity prices for Victorian families and for the families of Deakin.                     Yesterday we learnt a very interesting thing. We learnt that, after all of the discussion from the members of the opposition, we would never be able to reduce electricity prices. The Tasmanian regulator has ruled that electricity prices -                      I will come to that. The Tasmanian regulator has ruled that electricity prices will go down by 7.8 per cent in Tasmania. In Victoria, it is the same thing, because Victoria is an unregulated environment. In recent days, we have had commitment from the private sector - and if you had listened you would have got to this point - from AGL, from Origin and, indeed, from Energy Australia, that all of them would pass on the full cost savings from the carbon tax repeal as of 1 July.                     So all three major electricity retailers in Victoria - in addition to the regulated states of New South Wales, with regard to gas, and Queensland, Tasmania and the ACT, with regard to electricity - are going to pass on -                      all electricity savings back to consumers. So when the opposition gives this feigned impression of concern about the cost of living, we can actually reduce electricity prices right now. We can reduce electricity prices for families in Deakin and in Victoria. However, if we were not about to repeal the carbon tax -                      then what we see is that Victoria has just been slugged with $1.5 billion of carbon tax over the last year, $3 billion of carbon tax over the last two years and, in particular, within that is over $1.3 billion of electricity taxes in the year just finished. If we are not to repeal the carbon tax, then Victorians will pay an additional $1.3 billion in electricity taxes, and so will Victoria's firms. That is why in the last 24 hours we have had the Minerals Council call for the carbon tax to be repealed immediately, we have had the Australian Industry Group call for the carbon tax to be repealed -                      from small manufacturers and we have had the Business Council of Australia make this point: the carbon tax is one of the highest in the world and is imposing unnecessary costs on many businesses which cannot be passed on to consumers.                 If you care about lower electricity prices, get out of the way; and, if you care about profitable businesses, just this once, Bill, just say yes.

  It is true that some very tough decisions were made in this budget. It is tough that some tough decisions were made in this budget and it is true that some of those decisions impact on seniors. That is absolutely true, and I wish that members opposite had not run up the debt and deficit disaster that made these decisions necessary. I really do.                     I really do wish that members opposite had been more capable of running the economy.                     I really wish that members opposite actually kept their promises to deliver a budget surplus, but they never did. They put our country into a perilous economic position, and it was up to this government to take the necessary action to rectify the situation.                     The seniors of this country have seen enough of life to understand that governments, like families and businesses, just cannot keep living beyond their means, and that what this government was doing under members opposite. We were running up debt and deficit for our children and grandchildren to pay because members opposite were incapable of saying no.                     Members opposite were incapable of governing for a day, let alone a week, month or year without taxing and spending, without borrowing and spending. Members opposite were absolutely addicted to spending, and that is why under members opposite the Commonwealth's debt levels were projected to rise to $25,000 per man, woman and child. The seniors of this country are commonsense people. They understand that the last thing government should be doing is delivering cash splashes with borrowed money. It should not have happened under members opposite and certainly will not be happening under this government.

  I thank the member for Swan for his question because he, like all members on this side of the House, cares about fairness in higher education -                    The member for Griffith then left the chamber.                     for both students and taxpayers. The higher education reforms proposed by the government will deliver fairness for students and for taxpayers. They will do that because, at the moment, taxpayers are funding 60 per cent of the cost of a student's education at university and students are paying 40 per cent. Our reforms, when passed by the House and the Senate, will rebalance that contribution to 50-50. In most people's books, 50-50 is a very fair deal, especially when you consider that the students can borrow every single dollar of their share upfront from those very same taxpayers who are paying the other 50 per cent and at the best interest rates that they will ever get on a loan in their lives, and then they will go on to earn a million dollars more on average than those taxpayers who do not have a higher education qualification. So it is a very fair deal.                 Greater leaders than this one understood that in the past - Paul Keating, for example. When he was the Prime Minister he said:                 There is no such thing, of course, as 'free' education - somebody has to pay.                 In systems with no charges, those somebodies are all taxpayers. This is a pretty important point. A free higher education system is one paid for by the taxes of all, the majority of whom have not had the privilege of a university education. Ask yourself if you think that is a fair thing.                 I agree with Paul Keating. I think Paul Keating was right. He knew a little bit about fairness. I am asked about fairness, and today it - it has, remarkably, gone unnoticed by the opposition - the fourth anniversary of the Gillard coup against Kevin Rudd. On 24 June four years ago to this day, Bill the Knife sunk it into Kevin Rudd and made sure that he was no longer the Prime Minister.                     I withdraw. The Leader of the Opposition did not know much about fairness four years ago today. Four years ago he was not very fair to Kevin Rudd, and then three years later he was not very fair to Julia Gillard.                     I am talking about fairness - fairness to students, fairness to taxpayers and fairness to former Labor prime ministers. This man did not show much fairness to Kevin Rudd or to Julia Gillard. It wasn't shootout at the O.K. Corral; it was shootout at the Huang Hou!

  The people of Australia elected this government to tackle Labor's debt and deficit disaster. That is exactly what we are doing. We are tackling Labor's debt and deficit disaster, and one of the reasons why there is a debt and deficit disaster which this government has to handle is because members opposite persisted in unaffordable spending sustained by borrowed money.                     I accept that there are some payments that were made by the former government which are not going to be continued by this government. I absolutely accept that. We were up-front pre-election that there were payments that would not be paid by this government that had been paid by the previous government. The point we made again, again and again is that the Australian government cannot continue to live beyond its means. It did live beyond its means under members opposite. That is why members opposite intended to saddle our children and our grandchildren with unsustainable debt, with debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see. That will end under this government.                   The member for Jagajaga then left the chamber.

  It is a pleasure to receive a question from the member for Robertson and to reassure her and the communities of Gosford, Somersby and Terrigal that this government is focused on their future and building opportunity for their lives and for their children's lives. That is why we have implemented an economic action strategy.                  We did not create this trajectory of debt and deficit that Labor just wanted to add to and make worse and worse to limit our options for the future and to pass on to future generations a great burden they showed no interest in tackling when in government. We have been left the problem, but we are dealing with it. We are dealing with Labor's legacy. That is $667 billion worth of debt. As the Prime Minister has outlined, that is $25,000 for every man, woman and child. That is the trajectory Labor left us, and all the opposition leader can do is smirk about that legacy. This is a legacy that is limiting our economic prospects for the future and undermining the possibilities that the citizens of our nation can look forward to. That is why we have got our economic action strategy - to tackle the debt and the deficit left behind by Labor and to build the foundations for a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure future. That is why we have got $1 billion worth of debt servicing costs every month just to pay for Labor's legacy. We need to tackle that debt. We need to put incentive back into the system.                 There was a former Labor Prime Minister in this place, and I was going to say that it was one that the opposition leader backed, but frankly that wouldn't give you much help, would it? That wouldn't give you much guidance. It wasn't Prime Minister Rudd; it was Prime Minister Gillard. She stood in this place and she said:                 If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.                 Well Labor went out and they even claimed that they had cut company tax. They didn't. We are aiming to implement a reduction in company tax, because we know it is important to restoring incentive. Labor also went out there and said they would appoint a cabinet minister for deregulation. Instead they gave us an avalanche of 21,000 new and amended regulations. They gave us a carbon tax they promised they wouldn't implement. Our economic action strategy is about repairing the harm and hardship that Labor created, tackling the legacy that we didn't make but we are left to repair, making sure our citizens have better prospects for the future.                  My message to Labor is: just get out of the road; let us get on with this important task. Let us restore the 519,000 jobs lost in small business under the Labor administration. At some stage, Leader of the Opposition, listen to Prime Minister Gillard, listen to these words; listen to even what the other Prime Minister you supported at one stage, Kevin Rudd, had to say about the importance of red tape reduction. Help us by simply doing nothing other than getting out of the road so this side of the parliament can get on with the repair plan, the economic action strategy the nation is crying out for, to rebuild opportunity in our economy and the strength so we can be proud of what we leave for our kids.

Why does she think -                      that a system which is right for public servants is somehow wrong for other people in the Australian workforce?                 Â                  I do not wish to be personal, but members opposite, and indeed members on this side of the House, if they take parental leave, get paid at their wage. What is wrong with that? Why is it right for the member who asked the question to get parental leave at her wage and wrong for the rest of Australia to get it? I want a system which is fair. I want the same system which applies -                      to public servants to apply to people right around Australia.                     That is why the government's fair dinkum Paid Parental Leave scheme is a watershed reform. It is good for families, it is good for businesses, it is good for the economy and it should be implemented by this parliament.

  I thank the member for his question. Let me say that he is a member that is really concerned about the interests of young people. Let me inform the House that there is nothing that supports young job seekers more than a strong economy. That is why we handed down a budget in this House that is going to clean up the mess that we inherited from the members opposite, that is going to invest for the future and that is going to invest in infrastructure, creating tens of thousands of jobs. We will be repealing the carbon tax and repealing the mining tax. There is no substitute for a strong economy when it comes to creating jobs for young people. We simply cannot allow our young people to drift into the despair of lifelong welfare. Work is good for young people and work is good for the community. In addition to building a strong economy, we will be implementing a range of programs targeted at getting more people into work. We have announced the Job Commitment Bonus, a bonus to encourage young people to get and keep a job and, in doing so, to stay off welfare. We have announced relocation assistance, to encourage young people to be able to move to where the jobs are and to provide the financial support that they need to move to where the jobs are.                  We are introducing a new, revamped Work for the Dole program that is going to give young people the very basic skills that they need to get back into the workforce. Regrettably, as I get around the country, employers are telling me that so many young people who present at the gates of their business lack the very basic skills that they need to get by in the workforce. Work for the Dole has the ability to impart those skills to young people, to allow young people to demonstrate the benefits that they can bring to a workplace and what they can achieve if they are given a chance. We will also be introducing trade support loans to support young people into apprenticeships, and we will be introducing measures that will encourage young people to either be earning or learning. If they are not doing that, we will be requiring them to be participating in our Work for the Dole program. It is bit rich for members opposite to feign concern for young people when, on their watch, the youth unemployment rate increased by almost three per cent. On their watch, youth unemployment increased by 55,000. It has been 195 days since the shadow minister asked me a question, so he is clearly not concerned about the interests of young people. We are about creating opportunities for young people. You opposite are about standing in the way.

  As the pensioners of this country understand, this government inherited a debt and deficit disaster, thanks to the incompetence and the untrustworthiness of members opposite. We said that we would not change pensions, and pensions do not get changed until after the next election. They do not get changed until after the next election.                  Â                  What we propose to do after the next election is to apply the same indexation to pensions as members opposite applied to family tax benefit. If it is right for members opposite to apply this particular indexation to family tax benefit, how can it be somehow grievously wrong to do it for the pensions? Let me repeat for the benefit of members opposite and for the benefit of people right around Australia who members opposite are seeking to deceive: the pension goes up every six months every year. When members opposite changed the indexation method that applies to the family tax benefit, no less a person and no less a guardian of ethics and morality than the member for Jagajaga herself said in this House:                 The removal of the link to earnings ensures that government expenditure on -                  this particular social security benefit -                  is more sustainable in the long term.                 That is what Jenny Macklin, the member for Jagajaga, said. She said that they were changing indexation to make that particular social security benefit 'more sustainable in the long term'. The difference between this government and members opposite is that we want the pension to be sustainable.                     There are no pie-in-the-sky promises from this government. There are no cash splashes with borrowed money from this government. What there is from this government is decent, sensible, prudent government, and I think that pensioners of Australia understand that.

  I thank the member for Petrie, who is in this place for many reasons. He is a fine local member, but another reason he is here is that he is part of a party and a coalition that went to the last election and made a commitment that they would stop the boats. That is what we are doing. That is why he, like all members on this side, can look their constituents in the eye and say that we are doing what we said we would do and we are getting the results we said we would get. They know two things: they know that Labor started the boats and they know that the coalition is stopping the boats. That is what our constituents know.                 Border protection, as we on this side of the House all know, is not just about stopping the boats. Border protection goes right across the field of threats and issues that need to be countered and addressed at our borders. This government is doing everything within its means to address the many threats to our interests and to enforce our laws as they apply to the border. Our border agencies are on high alert, as the Prime Minister has said, to address the very serious threat of returning jihadists to Australia. For some months now we have been -                      You're kidding!                   The member for                    Corio                    then left the chamber.                     Only those opposite would think that trying to stop jihadists from entering Australia had nothing to do with the question about how we need to protect our borders. That explains a lot about where those opposite sit on these issues.                 We are taking steps. There are 10 national security alerts that we have every single day and 30 million passengers have come through our airports - going out or coming in - over the course of this year. So being on high alert is where our border agencies are. It has been a difficult job for them because the previous government ripped more than $700 million out of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. We have reinvested in this budget over $700 million into the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and in the establishment of the Australian Border Force. We have also invested $88 million in advance screening, which was announced by the coalition in opposition. We are enforcing our laws. We have already cancelled or rejected over 100 visas on the basis of character grounds and that ranges from criminality to even more serious threats to that. In addition, there has been a 20 per cent increase in field actions on illegal workers that has resulted in a more than 12 per cent increase in the location of illegal workers. There has been a more than 18 per cent increase in amphetamine type substance detections at our ports.                  They are the results you get when you take border protection seriously, when you invest in it and when you back the people who are tasked to do these jobs. So we are stopping the boats, but we are going to stop a lot more than that.

  I do accept that there are changes in the budget. Obviously, there are changes in the budget. There have to be changes in the budget to ensure that we address the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite created. The member who asked this question I believe used to work for the member for Lilley.                     Why were members opposite incapable of delivering on the four years of surpluses that they claimed to deliver in the 2012 budget?                     Why, indeed?                     The problem is that members opposite -                      simply could not be trusted with public money. That is the problem. The member has asked me about a single income family with two children. I can inform the member who asked me the question about a single income couple with two dependent children aged from six to 13. When one of them earns $60,000, this couple will continue to get in 2016-17 $8,348 from the taxpayer.                 The difference between the members opposite and this government is that under this government benefits are sustainable because they are being paid from a budget that is back in balance, and not from a budget which is simply out of control. That is the problem with the member for Rankin: he obviously was not much good at advising the member for Lilley because the member for Lilley was incapable - utterly incapable - of delivering us a balanced budget, let alone a surplus. This government will undo the damage created by its predecessor to the enduring benefit of every single Australian.

  I thank the member for Herbert for his question and commend him on the fine representation of the people of Townsville and surrounding areas that he brings to this House. I can confirm for him, and for his pensioners, that the energy supplement will continue to be paid to pensioners and, indeed, to all current recipients of the energy supplement - that is, $361 for singles and $542 for couples. In addition, as the member asked, the pension will continue to increase in March and September of each year and so too will the pensioner supplement continue to be paid. That is worth some $1,635 for singles and $2,464 for couples. Of course, that does not stop the ALP from misleading about these things. First of all, we had Senator Cameron claiming that pensioners in the future would not receive a payment they do not even get.                     That was from Senator Cameron. But now we have other members -                     -                      of the opposition. On Sunday, the member for Batman put out a tweet.                      Yes, he put out a tweet along with a poster in which claimed he that pensioners will lose money. He said that pensioners would lose $350 a year if single and $530 if a couple. I looked carefully at this poster. And who is it authorised by? It is authorised by Jenny Macklin. Ah! The member for Jagajaga has authorised this poster. It is simply wrong. This is another misleading claim from the opposition. First of all -                      This is wrong. Firstly, the rates are over a year old or 18 months out of date. Secondly, pensioners are not losing the energy supplement; they will continue to be paid it The opposition cannot even get their basic information right. And then I saw that it had been retweeted by the former member for Eden-Monaro. Remember the former member for Eden-Monaro, Mr Kelly? He has retweeted it. What is he doing now? He is an adviser to the Leader of the Opposition. So I say to the member for Jagajaga that she should correct her colleagues about the facts; the Leader of the Opposition should reprimand his staff; the member for Batman should correct the record and not seek to mislead older Australians; and the Australian Labor Party should stop misleading pensioners.

  I am very happy to inform the Shadow Treasurer that the single-income couple with two dependent children aged between six and 13 where one of the couple is earning $60,000 will continue to receive $8,348 from the taxpayer in social services benefits. It is very important that we continue to be a generous society, but we can only be a generous society if we have a sustainable budget. The tragedy is that thanks to the incompetence and the untrustworthiness of members opposite -                     -                      we faced a debt and deficit disaster.                     I can hardly hear myself think because of the caterwauling from members opposite -                      We can only continue to have a generous social security system if we have a sustainable budget. Unfortunately, thanks to members opposite -                    The member for Bendigo then left the chamber.                     we had a debt and deficit disaster. We had debt and deficit stretching as far as the eye can see. It had to end.                   The member for Charlton then left the chamber.                     Even with the changes that this government has made, even with the changes that members opposite are denouncing as cruel and immoral, we still only get to balance in four years time. That indicates the scale, the absolute scale of the debt and deficit disaster which members opposite created. I say again to the Leader of the Opposition that this government has had the integrity and the decency to say to the Australian people exactly how we are going to deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. We have told the Australian people how we will fix the problem the Leader of the Opposition created. Now the Leader of the Opposition needs to tell us how he will fix the problem that he and his colleagues did create.

  I thank the member for Macarthur for that question. I was very pleased to join the Prime Minister in the Macarthur electorate several weeks ago to announce that we will be spending $350,000 from our Safer Streets Program for 20 mobile CCTV cameras for Campbelltown City Council. As the member knows, as a veteran of 25 years in the New South Wales Police Force before coming to this place, CCTV does two very important things.                    The member for Greenway then left the chamber.                     Firstly, it acts as a deterrent for people to do the wrong thing in places where it has been placed. Secondly, if people have been doing the wrong thing where CCTV is present, it helps police to catch the perpetrators. As I have moved around the country and spoken to police officers about the utility of CCTV, they have given me numerous examples where it has helped them to catch people who have been doing the wrong thing. It saves them time and it also can save the court time because it is very hard for somebody to say they have not committed a crime if it is there in black and white on CCTV footage. The commitment we made to Macarthur is part of our $50 million Safer Streets Program, which we announced in October 2012 and which we were very pleased to deliver in this budget.                     We have made 150 individual commitments over 60 electorates all around the country.                   The member for Gorton then left the chamber.                     This $50 million is being provided from the criminal Confiscated Assets Account - money which, when Labor was in government, they froze. Previous governments of all political persuasions have spent proceeds of crime money on fighting crime, with the exception of the Labor government, when, in their frantic search for savings to prop up the budget they had destroyed, froze proceeds of crime money and refused to spend it on crime fighting initiatives. The member for Lilley has been suspended from the services of the House, but I hope he got a chance to write a thank-you note to Tony Mokbel, 'Thanks, Tony, for helping me prop up the budget bottom line that we had so destroyed.'                     This is exactly what you did. You took the money from criminals to prop up you dodgy budget bottom line.                     To assist the House, I withdraw. The point I was making was that they were taking money directly from criminal activities to prop up their dodgy budget bottom line and that is exactly what history will record.                     I withdraw, Madam Speaker. I am not sure how else you could characterise freezing proceeds of crime spending which had always been used by governments of both political persuasions to fund crime fighting initiatives all around the country, a practice which only ceased under the previous Labor government.                      We will use proceeds of crime to fight crime. That is exactly what previous governments have done - something Labor could not manage in their six years in office.

  The big difference between the way in which this government taxes fuel and the way in which the Labor Party addresses the issue is that this government refunds the excise that is paid by the trucking industry. The trucking industry pays its share of road construction costs through the road user charge, but, when it comes to the tax, the trucking industry receives a rebate in full. The major impact of the fuel tax on regional Australia is of course its impact on the trucking industry. It is a major impact on the cost of living and, obviously, the cost of doing business in regional communities. The reality is that that is fully refunded to the trucking industry.                     Labor's new regional representative, or whatever he is called at the present time, surely has heard of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is pretty fundamental to regional Australia. That ensures that the cost of trucking to regional committees is fully refunded, and therefore the cost impact on regional communities is managed in that way. That is our approach to this issue.                     We will continue to treat regional Australia fairly so that the cost of living in regional Australia is not artificially bloated by increasing the cost of transport fuel.

  I thank the member for Dobell for her question. I regret to inform her that members opposite, the Labor Party, gave Australia the world's biggest carbon tax and, thanks to members opposite, the world's biggest carbon tax just goes up. It just goes up by five per cent next Tuesday - unless, of course, the Leader of the Opposition has a change of heart and it is repealed.                 This is the carbon tax that the Labor Party was never going to introduce in the first place. This is the carbon tax that members opposite said they were going to terminate before the election. This is the carbon tax which is just going to go up by five per cent next Tuesday unless, of course, it is repealed in the meantime.                 For the people of Dobell, the carbon tax is a nine per cent impost on their power bills. It is a $9 billion handbrake on our economy. And it is a $550-a-year hit on every single household in Dobell and on every single household, on average, right around Australia. Repealing the carbon tax will be good for every single business and every single household in the electorate of Dobell.                 I can say that the carbon tax repeal legislation does provide the ACCC with new powers to ensure that consumers immediately benefit from the repeal of this toxic tax. This government has given the ACCC an extra $10 million to police the price effects of the repeal of this tax. The Chairman of the ACCC, Rod Sims, has said, 'What went up will clearly come down when you take away the carbon tax.' Mr Sims went on to say:                 Electricity prices went up fairly quickly on the way up and they will go down fairly immediately on the way down.                 And Origin Energy said:                 If and when the carbon price is removed as an input cost to energy bills, then Origin will pass on this benefit to consumers as soon as practicable _                 So get rid of the carbon tax and power prices go down.                 There is only one person standing in the way of lower power bills, and that is the Leader of the Opposition. Every time your power bill goes up, the Leader of the Opposition has a smile on his face because that is just the carbon tax doing its job. Every time you turn on the heater this winter, there is the Leader of the Opposition trying to make it more expensive -                      unless, of course, he has a change of heart, finally gets the message and votes to repeal this toxic tax.

  The tax I want to repeal is the carbon tax, which is a $9 billion hit on households. It is a $9 billion hit on households and that is the tax that is beloved - absolutely beloved - of the Leader of the Opposition. He said before the election that he was going to terminate the carbon tax, a $9 billion hit on households. Every time it comes before this parliament the Leader of the Opposition is the vacillator not the terminator.                     If the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about tax, why doesn't he vote immediately to repeal a $9 billion hit on every Australian household?                     If the Leader of the Opposition is so concerned about what he says is a $2.2 billion tax, what about a $9 billion tax? This is a government that will absolutely deliver on its commitments to reduce the taxation burden on the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition should know, if he studied the budget as carefully as he claims -                      that there is an overall $6 billion reduction in tax as a result of decisions this government has taken.

  I particularly want to thank the member for Reid because I am delighted to get a question about the environment, given that we have gone 9Â½ months with over 400 questions from the opposition but not one question about the environment. How many question from the opposition about the environment? Zero; not one.                     You are a courageous bunch, aren't you? Not one. In all of that time I would have been delighted to have had one about turtles, dugongs, the Reef Trust, the Green Army - you name it. Call me now, Bill. We would love to get one. Let the member for Port Adelaide go. Having said that, the member for Reid rightly made the point in his question that this tax does nothing for the environment, it has no significant impact on emissions, but does have a massive impact on families.                     In New South Wales over two years what have we seen?                     In New South Wales over two years what we have seen is a $3.4 billion hit to the economy. What we have seen is a $2.1 billion hit to electricity prices.                     So right now we can do something about the cost of living.                     It is good to have you back.                     About 1,000 times a day I ask myself what would Bill do and then I do the opposite - 1,000 times a day. I want to read a quote to you. The quote goes:                 The Government has decided to terminate the carbon tax to help cost-of-living pressures _                     I quote:                 The Government has decided to terminate the carbon tax to help cost-of-living pressures for families and to reduce costs for small business                 Who said that? One Kevin Rudd. Who was standing next to him? The member for McMahon and the member for Port Adelaide.                   The member for Scullin then left the chamber.                     They know that, if the carbon tax is taken away, it will reduce cost-of-living pressures. They know that it will reduce electricity prices for the member for Reid's residents, for his constituents. It is possible to reduce electricity prices, as we have seen from the New South Wales regulator, from the Queensland regulator, and from AGL and Origin. So if you want to do something about the cost of living - if you want to get rid of a system that does not work - it is very simple: repeal the carbon tax and, just this once, Bill, say 'Yes.'

  It is very hard to take the Leader of the Opposition seriously -                      about a $2.2 billion tax when he keeps voting in favour of a $9 billion tax. There is the King Kong of taxes, the carbon tax, which the Leader of the Opposition loves. Notwithstanding having promised to terminate the thing before the last election, he keeps voting in favour of it after the election. It is simply impossible to take this Leader of the Opposition seriously. How on earth can he promise, before the election, to terminate the carbon tax and yet consistently vote in this parliament to keep the carbon tax? I repeat: every time your power bill goes up, there is the Leader of the Opposition with a smile on his face - because that is his pet carbon tax just doing its job. Every time you turn on your heater this winter, there is the Leader of the Opposition standing beside you saying, 'Your power bill is higher than it should be.' Your heating is more expensive than it should be, thanks to his beloved carbon tax.                 He also asked me about paid parental leave. As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, members on this side of the House stand for wage justice.                     We do. If it is right for public servants to be paid at their wage when they go on parental leave, it is right for every single person to get paid at his or her wage when he or she goes on parental leave. Why does the Leader of the Opposition have this terrible double standard - this terrible and hypocritical double standard? He thinks that public servants should get access to their wage when they get paid parental leave, but not the rest of the economy.                     I am sure, in order to avoid hypocrisy and double standards, what the Leader of the Opposition wants to see is paid parental leave for public servants paid at the minimum wage - at a welfare wage - because, if there is to be any consistency and any integrity from the Leader of the Opposition, that is the obvious conclusion to draw. He wants public servants -                      to go on parental leave; he wants people like his own staff to go on parental leave at a welfare wage, not at their real wage.                     I want every single Australian who goes on paid parental leave to be paid at his or her wage. That is fair, that is right, and that will be delivered under this government.

  I would like to say, first of all, I am only too happy to meet them; I look forward to meeting them. It is also encouraging to find out there are so many people who want to go into agriculture. It might be that there has been a change of government and we are turning things around. It might be that this is one of the reasons we have had such a large increase - in fact, a 19.3 increase - for the March quarter in agriculture.                     We are not the ones who placed the carbon tax on them. We are not the ones who shut down the live cattle trade. That was your side. You are the side that shut down agriculture; we are the side that is getting it going again.                 But I do acknowledge the issues. To the member for Indi: what we are hoping is that, as there is a greater demand for agriculture - because our side has turned the show around - that will naturally attract people into the agricultural faculties. I also acknowledge that, if the sandstone universities decide to put up fees, that will make regional universities more competitive. I have had a look at some of these. Others think this as well. One is Jim Barber, the Chancellor of the University of New England, my old alumni. He said:                 I have no doubt the big end of town in Australia will begin jacking up their prices in response to fee deregulation, but they will be doing so just as a range of new online, low-cost yet high-quality competitors are entering our domestic market. As a result, we are likely to see prices move in both directions _ the prestigious university brands will find themselves going head-to-head with a raft of cheaper but equally high-quality competitors.                 Â                  I note that at the University of New England the vast majority of students are external and they provide a very good product to the marketplace. Their former chancellor supports this. Also, the Regional Universities Network said:                 We recognise that, in a deregulated fee environment, the Government has chosen to ensure scholarships for low SES and other students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in higher education.                 This is a great move by the Minister for Education. I think $1 in every $5 of extra fees goes towards scholarships.                  To the member for Indi: these are the people in our towns, in the Quilpies, in the Baradines, in remote towns, who need access because the pathway to a greater life is through tertiary education. I remember that it was a former member for my seat, Mr Drummond, who set up the University of New England and recognised that. We will continue on this side to be the champion for regional education and for making sure that we get the best form of education, especially in the agricultural field.

  I think, if I may say so:                 Increasing the age pension age is a responsible reform to meet the challenge of an ageing population _                  Â Â Â _Â Â Â  _Â Â Â  _                 Australia must move towards a higher pension age over the next decade.                 That was what the member for Jagajaga said when members opposite raised the pension age. I might also say:                 _ in order to make the pension system is sustainable in the long run, we also made the hard decision to raise the qualifying age for the age pension.                  There is a lesson in that decision and the lesson is this: when we make policy we need to have the courage to adapt to changing demographic trends. It simply was not feasible to continue with a pension age drawn up a century ago.                 That was the former Treasurer, the member for Lilley. Following on from the decision by members opposite to raise the pension age to 67, we think it is perfectly reasonable to raise the pension age to the age of 70 by 2035.                 In 21 years time the pension age will be 70. Given the changes in life expectancy, given the changes in healthy life expectancy, given the additional support that this government is going to give to older workers, including the Restart wage subsidy, we think this is right and proper. We think older people should be economic contributors, not just social and cultural contributors. We want to give -

  I am being spoilt today! I would like to thank the member for Forrest for the question. Might I note that the member for Forrest herself currently is a dairy farmer; in fact, when she got married they went straight back to the dairy farm. So we have a person in the member for Forrest, which is the strongest dairy producing area in Western Australia, who actually knows -                      what it is like to be in dairy and what it is like to be in small business. Small business: you have either lived it or you haven't lived. There are so many on our side who have actually had their name at the bottom of the chequebook and the mortgage on the house. We understand that.                 I would like to tell the member for Forrest the good news first. Since we have been in power the exports of butter have gone up 61.1 per cent, the exports of skim milk powder by 43 per cent - this is in value, by the way - and the exports of whole milk powder by 60 per cent. In fact, the exports of dairy products in general have gone up by 43 per cent because we are actually doing the business, we are actually moving product.                 There is also some bad news, and of course the bad news is on the other side of the chamber. The bad news is the Labor Party, because they still support the carbon tax and the carbon tax is costing every person in their dairy shed in excess of $1,300 a year. It is costing one of our largest dairy producers, Murray Goulburn, $14 million a year. That is $14 million that they could be sending back to farming families.                 We used to think they were terminators - even the member for Hunter last week was still a terminator under his breath. I said, 'Mate, you're no longer terminators.' He said, 'Well, I am, I'm still a little bit of a terminator.' You were a massive terminator, you were a massive terminator, but no longer. I think the only terminators that are left in the Labor Party -                      Hello? Are you talking to me or are you talking to the Speaker?                   The member for                    Riverina                    then left the chamber -                      Whatever it was, I withdraw it. But I tell you what: there are still two terminators on the other side - there still are. There is Tanya the terminator -                      Or Member for Sydney the terminator, but she is not going to terminate the bill on the carbon tax; she is going to terminate -                      the bill at the front desk. That is what she is going to terminate. But there are other terminators. There is the member for Grayndler. I think he might be a bit of a terminator as well - he is the people's choice of a terminator. So we look forward to them terminating you very soon.

  It is great to get a question from the member for Barton. He is a great advocate for his community and the small businesses in Monterey, Bardwell Park and Carlton. And isn't it interesting: it has been some 217 days since the Labor Party thought small business mattered enough to actually ask me a question. Doesn't that tell you all you need to know about where Labor is at?                   The member for Adelaide then left the chamber.                     I know on this side we love small business and we will work as hard for them every day as they do for their success. Part of that is getting on with the job of repairing the debt and deficit disaster left to us by the former government.                 We did not create the problems. We did not create the trajectory of debt, which will cost $25,000 for every man, woman and child. The Leader of the Opposition can smile and smirk and be pleased with his work, but not many others are. The Australian small-business community are not pleased with your work, Leader of the Opposition - five hundred and nineteen thousand jobs lost in the small-business sector under Labor. And now, when the small-business community are calling for budget repair to build confidence and the economic conditions that we need to grow our economy and so they can grow their businesses, you are now standing in the way of that work. This government did not create the debt and deficit disaster, but you are now standing in the way of repairing it. Forty billion dollars worth of savings the coalition has put forward to start that economic recovery that is needed in this country, and not only are you the cause of the problem; the Leader of the Opposition and his Labor Party are opposing that recovery work.                 Even independent experts - the Parliamentary Budget Office - made it clear, and I will quote:                 It is time to start coming out [of debt and deficit], otherwise the longer you leave it the more exposed you become and the harder it is to wind it back.                 The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry made the point very clearly:                 The budget goes a long way to restoring all important business confidence that will drive investment and job creation, particularly for Australia's two million small businesses _                 In this House, I pointed out that Labor wanted to forget that the member for McMahon was once the Treasurer of the country. At least they have now repaired that, and now the member for McMahon actually recognises that he was once Treasurer. We would like to forget, but we cannot forget because -                      we have got the job to fix the mess. The member for McMahon used to believe in the importance of budget surpluses. He said, and I quote - this was under Labor:                 The Government has returned the Budget to surplus three years ahead of schedule and ahead of any other major advanced economy.                 It used to matter to the member for McMahon - budget credibility used to be important. I have reminded him that he once was Treasurer; I am happy to remind him that he once had budget and economic credibility. I suggest the member for McMahon step up, save the Leader of the Opposition from himself, stop having this Leader of the Opposition talking out both sides of his pie-hole and get on board our budget repair task.

  There are changes to the pension, and they will take place after the next election. Our commitment not to change the pension in this term of parliament is absolutely honoured in the government's budget.                 The member who asked the question is a relatively new member of parliament and she may have forgotten what her own government did when it was in power between 2007 and 2013. What this government has done is put in place the same indexation for the pension after 2017 -                      We have put in place the same indexation for the pension after the next election that the shadow minister, now shaking her head, put in place for the family tax benefit. If the indexation system is fair for family tax benefits, it is fair for other social service benefits. If it is fair for people who depend upon the family tax benefit, it is fair for people who depend upon other social security benefits.                 Is the member opposite who asked the question seriously saying that, on top of the $40 billion of savings measures that the Labor Party are now opposing - on top of opposing $40 billion worth of savings measures - they are now proposing to spend the extra billions and billions that will be required to restore MTAWE indexation to the family tax benefit? Is that what she is seriously saying? If she is - and, frankly, she must be if she is trying to be consistent - it just proves, again and again and again, that you just cannot trust the Labor Party with public money. They created the debt and deficit disaster which the budget that the Leader of the Opposition loves to hold up is fixing. They created the debt and deficit disaster which the budget that they love to hold up is fixing. They just have not learned. They just do not get it. They do not understand that governments, like families, cannot keep on living beyond their means. We understand this, and that is why the budget that we have brought down is right, it is fair and it will end the intergenerational theft which members opposite inflicted on the Australian public.

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question, because he knows the importance of Australia having a strong and prosperous economy. It is essential for doing business. It is essential for maintaining our lifestyle. And, of course, this is the right budget for these difficult times. We need to respond to the circumstances - the debt we have inherited, the importance of fulfilling and honouring our commitment before the election to open Australia for business, to declare Australia open and willing to embrace business.                 Of course, the things we need to do to do that include abolishing the carbon tax, which has already caused $15.4 billion worth of damage to the Australian economy, for no gain - a $9 billion attack on jobs and a $550 hit to every household in Australia. And the member for Lyne knows how important it is to get rid of the mining tax. One of our most significant industries is expected to carry another burden, and that delivers a wave of uncertainty to investors in this vital sector right across this country.                  The Treasurer and the Minister for Trade yesterday in China met the National Development and Reform Commission. They were greeted, in opening remarks by Chairman Xu from the council, with these words: 'The investment environment in Australia has improved a lot since the election of a new government.' One of our major trading partners - our biggest trading partner - has noticed, and it is recognising what a difference this government has made.                  So it is time that the opposition joined us in opening Australia for business, instead of constantly trying to shut the door. There are $40 billion worth of savings that they will not allow to pass through the parliament - $5 billion of which were their own savings. They were their idea, and now they will not vote for them in the parliament. And, of course, there are $13 billion worth of savings that are attached to the mining tax. That is the style of government that we would have if Labor were in power. How would they raise this $40 billion? Probably by increasing the carbon tax, because the carbon tax has become so endeared to them. You would need to raise the carbon tax to $75 a tonne if you were going to balance the budget on their kind of economics. So is that Labor's vision for the future? The Leader of the Opposition said he understood the importance of making the budget sustainable, when he spoke to CEDA early this week. Well, get on with it then. Vote for this budget. Vote to enable Australia to progress.

  Under this government, the pension goes up every six months, every year. The pension goes up -                       I am so pleased to have them waving around the budget, because the budget that they wave around -                    The member for Gellibrand then left the chamber.                     is the budget that corrects that debt and deficit disaster that they created. The budget that they wave around is the budget that fixes the debt and deficit disaster that they created. They have the solution to their problem in their hands! That is what they do. They have got it in their hands.                     If only they could read, indeed! And, if they could read, if only they could understand! Understanding, I fear, is lacking from members opposite. They have ears that do not hear -                    The member for Griffith then left the chamber.                     they have eyes that do not see and they have brains that do not work. That is the problem. Let me repeat, for the benefit of the shadow minister who asked the question: pensions go up every six months -                      every single year under this government. But, from September 2017, after the next election, they will go up with the same rate of indexation that the member who asked the question thought was fair for other social security benefits. It is exactly the same indexation that, when she was the minister, she thought was right and fair and proper for social security benefits. If it was fair for the family tax benefit, it is fair for other benefits. If it was fair for the former government to bring in that particular form of indexation, it is surely fair for this government to do exactly the same thing.

  I can tell the member for McMillan, who cares very deeply about low-SES and disadvantaged young people being given the opportunity to go to university, that one of the most important features of our higher education reforms is that they will spread opportunity to many more young people to go to university and get a higher education qualification. At least 80,000 more young people will get the chance to go to university - typically, students from low-SES backgrounds and first generation university goers. That is one of the reasons the government is so supportive of these higher education reforms.                 One of the ways we are making these reforms is by having the largest Commonwealth scholarships fund in Australia's history. The Minister for Agriculture mentioned earlier in question time that rural and regional universities will have the chance to design their scholarships in order to compete with all other universities. This fact has been recognised today by the Australian Technology Network of universities. The University of South Australia; the Queensland University of Technology; Curtin University; the University of Technology, Sydney; and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology put out a statement today on behalf of the ATN saying:                  The Australian Technology Network of Universities (ATN) supports the Commonwealth Scholarship model unveiled in the Federal Budget as being in the best interest of students in a deregulated higher education system.                 The ATN Executive Director was quoted as saying:                 What actually matters is more low SES students participating and achieving at university without the need for costly oversight.                  So the university sector is starting to realise the enormous benefits that will flow to students and taxpayers because of the government's higher education reforms.                  I am also asked about consistency. Our consistency of approach stands in stark contrast to the other side of politics in this place. I would ask you to tell me, Madam Speaker, what these 12 people have in common: Julia Gillard, Simon Crean, Peter Garrett, the Leader of the Opposition, Chris Evans, the member for McMahon, Craig Emerson, Senator Kim Carr, Jacinta Collins, the member for Wills, the member for Adelaide and the member for Parramatta. All those people have something in common: in the last six years every one of them has been a shadow minister or minister for education. In six years there have been 12 shadow ministers or ministers for education.                  And they sent somebody else over the top, yesterday. They have appointed the member for Kingston as the 13th. Thirteen Labor members share the distinction of passing the parcel on education reform over the last six years.                     They might change the faces of their higher education and education reform but the problem is that Labor does not get the need to give our universities the chance to be their best, and to get more students into university.

  There are more than 10 million households in this country and each and every one of them, on average, will receive $550 of benefit by the abolition of the carbon tax. The 10 million-plus households of Australia will each receive $550-plus by the abolition of the carbon tax.                  The Leader of the Opposition has been complaining and grizzling about a $2.2 billion tax over four years. What about the $36 billion carbon tax that he loves so much that, despite having promised to terminate it again and again before the election, he votes in favour of again and again, and again and again, after the election? You cannot take this Leader of the Opposition seriously when it comes to cost-of-living pressures, because if he was fair dinkum he would not be smiling every time your power bill goes up. He would not be smiling every time your power bill goes up, but he is smiling because that is just the carbon tax doing its job.                 Why don't you just answer a question, once in your life?                     I think he's got irritable Bill syndrome. I think that is the problem that the Leader of the Opposition has at the moment.                     I do apologise. We should not engage in levity in this chamber. I accept that. The point this government made - over and over again - before the election is that this country could not afford cash splashes with borrowed money. What this government has done is ensure that periodic payments, occasional payments, that this country can no longer afford - such as the schoolkids bonus, such as the low-income supplement and such as the seniors supplement - are no longer being paid. I believe that the decent people of this country do understand, even those who are doing it tough, that the government cannot go on loading up our children and grandchildren with unsustainable debts.                 I notice that members opposite have stopped waving around the budget, because they did not like having in their hands the solution to the problem they created.                     They do have, in their hands, the solution to the problem they created. We did not create the problem - Labor created the problem - but we will solve the problem. We will take responsibility for getting the budget back under control. And we have.

  I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. One of the first lines of defence in national security is border protection and the control of movement across our borders. An integral part of our armoury is our travel documentation. Today the government has released the new P-series passport. On indulgence, Madam Speaker, I will refer to this.                  It improves on previous passports, as it includes a number of enhanced security measures, making it one of the most secure and trustworthy passport documents in the world. The specialist paper used in this new passport, particularly for the biographic data page, is extremely difficult to forge, and I am pleased to say that this secure paper is made in Australia by a paper mill in the member's own electorate of Gilmore.                  There is a state-of-the-art colour-floating image laminate; it contains new optic features and a new electronic chip, which is lighter, stronger and faster. There are more features only detectable by ultraviolet light and special covert features, which provide additional levels of security. This cutting-edge advance in the integrity of our passports builds on our whole-of-government approach to protecting our borders and keeping Australia safe from those who would do us harm. I will not hesitate to cancel the passports of any Australian citizens suspected of engaging in terrorist activity and being a threat to our national security. The Australian government condemns terrorism and extremism, and we are taking a coordinated approach to countering it, across a whole range of areas.                 Our intelligence agencies are working closely with our key partners. Indeed, this morning I met with ambassadors and representatives from the Middle East to discuss cooperation in counter-terrorism, in relation to events in Syria and Iraq. We have listed hundreds of terrorists and terrorist organisations, recently - 83 terrorist listings - in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions. Australia has a comprehensive sanctions and terrorist-asset-freezing regime. It is a criminal offence to provide support, including financial support, to a terrorist or terrorist organisations.                 Next month, Australia assumes the presidency of the global Financial Action Task Force. This promotes legal, regulatory and operational measures to counter-terrorist financing across the globe. Australians must not support terrorists or terrorist organisations, in any way whatsoever. We have strong penalties in place, including imprisonment of up to 25 years, for a range of terrorist offences.                  Our nation is an inclusive one. It is built on tolerance and respect for others. But we will not tolerate criminal behaviour from extremists. We will take strong action against any person who threatens our national security.

 There are a number of decisions in the budget which, in a better world, this government would not have taken. But unfortunately we have to live in the world that we inherited from our predecessors.                     What we inherited from our predecessor was debt and deficit, as far as the eye can see. We inherited a debt-and-deficit disaster and we are taking the necessary decisions - the tough decisions; the very difficult decisions - to address the debt-and-deficit disaster we were left with.                 No-one likes doing what is necessary to ensure that our country can live within its means. No-one likes doing what is necessary to ensure that our children and grandchildren are not loaded up with unsustainable debt. But it has to be done, and if it were not done now it would be even harder in a few years time.                     We have taken difficult decisions, now, to avoid even more difficult decisions in a few years time.                     For some years, they do go into the Medical Research Future Fund. And why should they not? The research of today is the treatments and cures of tomorrow. The research of today provides us with the treatments and cures of the future.                 Â                      This is a budget for saving, but it is also a budget for building. This is a budget for living within our means, but it is also a budget for building on our strengths, and one of our great strengths is the health and medical research community of this country, and I am happy that they are being supported by this budget.

  I thank the member for Hume for his question. He was a proven performer before he came to this place, and he is proving himself here. He understands that proven policy is what works. The success of Operation Sovereign Borders to date is because we are implementing proven policy - policies that we knew would work. It is not surprising, therefore, that it has been more than six months without a successful people-smuggling venture to Australia.                 The policies that we advocated, which those opposite when they were in government abolished, were based on a proven record under the Howard government. They were not theories; their performance was proven fact. By contrast, what those opposite did in the border protection space - what the Labor Party did when they were in government - was run their own 'festival of dangerous ideas' on a daily basis when it came to border protection. It was an absolute carnival. Thankfully, the people of Australia put an end to that carnival. But, sadly, the carnies still line the frontbench of the opposition, and they continue to hold onto their opposition to the policies that work. They hold onto their opposition and are completely against the policies that worked under the government.                 History is repeating itself, because we can say - every member of this side of the House can say - that, once again, we are deciding who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. That is the product of Operation Sovereign Borders - the policies that those opposite oppose. They continue their tradition of opposing these policies, and the shadow minister is continuing the fine tradition of the ministers, when they were in government, that went before him. We have already heard from him a litany of errors and mistakes. He does not understand the difference between a visa application and a visa grant, as we saw yesterday in this House, but he also went to the Press Club and blamed the flow of boats coming to Australia under Labor on the iPhone and Steven Jobs!                  I know it is hard to get good help on that side for a new shadow minister who does not know his brief. He looks across the frontbench of those opposite, and all he can see is failure. I can say that, when I was shadow minister, I had a lot of tall shoulders to lean on - particularly the member for Berowra, who sits here, and the Minister for Social Services - and I could go to those who had policies that worked. So I say to the shadow minister opposite - sorry; the deputy shadow minister; the real shadow minister is in the other chamber: Senator Hanson-Young - if you are looking for policies that work, look this way.

  Unlike members opposite, who never consulted with anyone when they were in government, this is a consultative and collegial government.                     I made it absolutely crystal clear that this government is committed to a modest price signal for GP services. I say to members opposite: if it is right and fair and proper to have a modest co-payment for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, how can it be wrong to have a modest co-payment for Medicare? If it was right for Bob Hawke to introduce a modest co-payment for Medicare, if it was right for the member for Jagajaga to support a modest co-payment for Medicare and if it is right for the member for Fraser to support a modest co-payment for Medicare, why is it wrong to have a modest co-payment?                     I know that the Labor shadow Assistant Treasurer over there knows that something has to be done to make Medicare sustainable. He knows that a modest co-payment is a perfectly reasonable way -                      Bob Hawke knew that the Medicare system was unsustainable, the member for Jagajaga knew that the Medicare system was unsustainable, the member for Fraser knows that the Medicare system is unsustainable, without a modest co-payment. The AMA knows that a modest copayment would improve our Medicare system, and that is why I am perfectly happy to work with the AMA to ensure that Australia has the best possible Medicare system.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and I note his very keen interest in this subject of broadband, which stands in marked contrast to that of the opposition. The shadow minister for communications, the member for Blaxland, has only asked me one question. It was not about broadband; it was about my boat - and he's lost all interest in my boat too! Mind you, they seem to have lost all interest in questioning the immigration minister about boats as well, so it's probably nothing personal; I shouldn't be offended!                 The NBN has now over 200,000 paying customers, and we have trebled the number of paying, connected customers on the fibre network since the election. Our focus has been on actually connecting people, getting fibre to the premises and getting people to pay for it as opposed to the Labor Party's policy, which was simply fibre to the press release! Thousands and thousands of premises they claimed to have been passed by fibre; 80 per cent of them at the time of the election could not get a service even if they wanted one. They could be there, their pockets stuffed with money, wanting to give it to the NBN, but there was nowhere they could get it, because the fibre only went as far as the press release.                 The focus on getting a stable financial basis depends on good homework. The Labor Party never did its homework. They were like somebody who hears about a restaurant, thinks it sounds great, goes in, does not look at the menu.                     They hear about a restaurant. They think it sounds good. They do not look at the menu. They run in. They realise that the meal is going to take hours and hours to get there and it is going to cost a fortune.                 There is a better way. The Labor Party sometimes has done their homework on restaurants, and I have a good example here in the menu from the Hoang Hau restaurant, where the Leader of the Opposition was four years ago on Monday. All the prices were there: stuffed crispy chicken wing - that would have been the left wing member for Grayndler, I think, that got stuffed on that night - $7.20. Peking shredded Rudd - no, sorry, beef - $16.80. But when they went through the menu of the Hoang Hau on that famous night when the Leader of the Opposition was indeed doing his homework, what was the endgame? What was the outcome? You find the clue in the last -                      The object of that evening - of all that homework, of course - in the long run was the last item in the menu, among the vegetarian specialties: happy green Ireland. That's what it was all about: happy green Ireland - $14.80!

  This government is determined to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster, and that is exactly what this budget does. It tackles Labor's debt and deficit disaster; it tackles the fact that Labor had left us with a legacy of $123 billion in cumulative budget deficits and $667 billion in projected debt. Members opposite once thought that a surplus was important. For instance, the Leader of the Opposition said back in 2012:                 This month's budget delivers a $1.5 billion surplus.                 It didn't, but he went on to say:                 Achieving it has meant making some tough calls. A big win in the 2012 budget is the surplus.                 He went on to say:                 The budget surplus proves beyond doubt that we can afford to be positive.                 Well, he might have been positive back in 2012. We have seen precious little positivity from the Leader of the Opposition since the election last year. But he should be positive about this budget because this budget cures the debt and deficit disaster that Labor created. The best thing that members opposite could do with this budget is to say, 'It is the tough medicine we just had to have,' and then our country would go forward on a secure fiscal footing.

  I do thank the member for Bass for his question and I can assure him that what is standing in the way of lower power prices for Australians is the carbon tax. That is what is standing in the way of lower power prices for Australians and for Tasmanians. The only person standing in the way of the repeal of the carbon tax is the Leader of the Opposition sitting opposite me today. The only person who is standing in the way of the repeal of the carbon tax is the Leader of the Opposition. He said he wanted to terminate the carbon tax pre-election, but now he wants to perpetuate it, because he just doesn't get it. He doesn't get the fact that the carbon tax is an impost of nine per cent on every Australian's power bill; he doesn't get it that the carbon tax adds $9 billion a year to the cost in our economy; and he just doesn't grasp the fact that the carbon tax is a $550 a year hit on the average household's costs.                  It must go and I am confident that the carbon tax will go when the legislation goes before the Senate in the next fortnight. I do welcome the statement of the member for Fairfax that he and his senators will support the government's legislation to repeal the carbon tax. The member for Fairfax is absolutely right: abolishing the carbon tax will make our industries more competitive and it will make our people's lives more manageable. I do look forward to working with the member for Fairfax and crossbench senators to ensure that all the savings from the abolition of the carbon tax are passed on to consumers.                 Who is left supporting the carbon tax? Only the Leader of the Opposition, who is in denial about the election result. He's got Senator Hanson-Young dictating his border protection policy; he's got Senator Christine Milne dictating his carbon tax policy. Every time your power bill goes up, there is the Leader of the Opposition with a smile on his face, because that is his carbon tax doing its job. Every time you turn on your heater, there is the Leader of the Opposition making it more expensive. This government will deliver on its commitment to abolish the carbon tax, and I am delighted the crossbench senators will deliver on their commitment to abolish this toxic tax once and for all.

 I did listen to member's question and it does contain a statement, which is simply untrue, and I challenge the member who asked the question to authenticate the statement that he claims I made.                      The statement that the member included in his question is simply untrue. The version that the member used in his question is simply wrong.                     There are some savings that this government is seeking to make in respect of the CSIRO, but the former government certainly cut the CSIRO in its time. My understanding is that any job losses at the CSIRO up until now result not from decisions of this government but from decisions of the previous government - yet again, mendacity and hypocrisy from members opposite.

  Thank you to the member for Lindsay for her question. I believe that this is the 29th question on the environment from this side of chamber but, after 9Â½ months, more than 410 questions -                    The member for                    Chifley                    then left the chamber.                     and, to the best of my recollection, not one question on the environment, nothing from the opposition - nothing about the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement, nothing about the feral pig eradication program, nothing about the Western Sydney conservation corridor. Hello, good to see you!                      From the member who called Canada a pariah, that is a great comment - a real triumph of diplomacy, that one. Let me make these points: as the member for Lindsay says, her electorate is suffering more from higher electricity and gas prices than they need to. But on Monday of this week, AGL, which services numerous customers in her electorate, made the following statement:                  _ price reductions will flow through to residential and small business customers, if the carbon repeal legislation is passed by the Federal Parliament.                 A very interesting thing happened just an hour and a half ago: in the Senate, the Labor Party voted to try to put back the repeal date for the carbon legislation; they voted to try to put back the consideration of the carbon legislation. There will be a new Senate soon and, when that happens, they will consider it -                       No-one told you, Buster. When that happens, they will consider it at the earliest possible time. Do you know what happens? AGL has said that they will reduce -                      Origin will reduce prices. Alinta will reduce prices. Energy Australia will reduce prices, and in Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT -                    The member for                    Moreton                    then left the chamber.                     the regulators have all said that they will reduce prices. More than that, the ACCC will be on the job, but we are happy to take the considerations of members of this House and to go even further to enshrine in legislation guarantees over and above what we already have so prices will be lower than they would otherwise have been. Electricity and gas costs will be down, and the people who are standing directly in the way ought to realise that change is coming, and that change will mean lower electricity and gas prices.

  The Leader of the Opposition should have more faith in the universities of Australia. The universities of our country are determined to do the right thing by their students and by their potential students. They are also determined to do the right thing by learning - they are the custodians of our best traditions. They are the custodians of our higher learning, and the last thing that they want is to price degrees out of the reach of the Australian people.                 I am very confident that under a less regulated university system we will have better degrees and we will have even more access to higher education than we do now, particularly with this government's changes that will extend the FEE-HELP system to subdegree courses. For the first time, we will extend FEE-HELP to subdegree courses. For the first time, we will extend FEE-HELP to a much wider range of institutions. It is going to be good for universities but, above all else, it is going to be good for students.                 Leave not granted.

  I want to make the point in response to the member who asked the question that there is no country in the world, according to the Productivity Commission, that has an economy-wide carbon tax or indeed an economy-wide emissions trading scheme. For instance, the European ETS covers just 45 per cent of total emissions at about $8 a tonne; California's ETS covers about 35 per cent of total emissions at about $12 a tonne; New Zealand's ETS covers 50 per cent of total emissions at about $4.60 per tonne; and the Chinese ETS, or the proposed pilot in Beijing, covers 40 per cent of total emissions. And I am advised that 99.9 per cent of permits have been provided to industry for free.                 When it comes to carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes, the world is going against the Greens' view. The problem that the Greens have, apart from the fact that they are being echoed by the Leader of the Opposition, and the problem the Labor Party have is that, as far as they are concerned, Copenhagen never happened. That is the thing: they have not woken up to the fact that everything with respect to climate change changed at Copenhagen. What we are doing is proposing -                      What we are doing is proposing direct action. The interesting thing is that the countries that talk most loudly about tackling climate change and the countries that we are happy to work with when it comes to tackling climate change are countries that are putting direct action measures into place, such as President Obama's direction action measure to limit power station emissions.

  We know that the Labor Party is not too good with numbers but they surely realised when they imposed the only economy-wide carbon tax in the world that it would apply to health services. Surely they realised that the hospitals, the pharmacists, the dental practices, GP practices around the country -                      every time they use energy. It is a cost that they cannot absorb, that they must pass on to consumers. What does it mean? It means that they are taking away the capacity to put more into frontline services. We know that Treasury analysis in New South Wales says that Labor's carbon tax would impose $26.5 million on to the New South Wales health system.                     The amazing thing is that Labor just does not get it. Even today, they do not realise that hospitals in other countries do not face this carbon tax. This carbon tax takes the capacity away to deliver more surgery.                   The member for                    Charlton                    then left the chamber.                     It makes it harder for doctors to see those patients. It makes it harder for pharmacists to provide those services because they are paying the carbon tax implemented by the Labor Party every time they flick on the switch or pay for goods that are coming into their practice.                     We know that analysis in Victoria shows that each and every year the carbon tax will cost $13.5 million as it applies to electricity and gas -                      in their hospitals and across their health system and it grows each and every year.                 It made me think about the scene from Yes Minister where they talk about the hospital being perfect except for the fact that it has got patients in it. The problem is that our hospitals do have patients in them. And we need to keep the lights on, we need to make sure that the operating theatres continue and we need to make sure that the intensive care units keep operating.                     We cannot turn off the power. I am not sure if this is some sort of revelation to the Labor Party but we cannot turn the power off. They have to pay the carbon tax. Every time they use gas or electricity in these public hospitals, they are paying the carbon tax.                 My advice to Labor premiers and to the Territory chief ministers is that they get on the phone to this Leader of the Opposition because Bill Shorten is the only person who is standing in the way of the abolition of the carbon tax. And the Leader of the Opposition needs to get out of the way and get this carbon tax off the back of all Australians.

  This government is determined to ensure that there is a modest copayment for GP services. Just as members opposite support a modest copayment for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, this government supports a modest copayment for Medicare. There was a time when members opposite thought that a modest copayment for Medicare made sense. Prime Minister Bob Hawke supported a copayment. The member for Jagajaga supported a copayment. The shadow assistant Treasurer -                      The last thing I want to do is to verbal the absent, so, to assist you, Madam Speaker, I withdraw. But the fact is -                      I have withdrawn.                     Let me repeat for the benefit of members opposite. They support a modest copayment for the PBS. They did support a modest copayment for Medicare. The Labor shadow assistant Treasurer still supports a modest copayment for Medicare.                     I am perfectly prepared to accept that the member for Fraser has been bullied into changing his mind.                     If it is right and proper for members opposite -                      to support a modest copayment on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, how can it not be right and proper to support an equally modest copayment on Medicare?                 I can tell you why the government has done a number of tough and difficult things in this budget. We have done tough and difficult things because we want to restore the budget to balance and eventually to surplus, and once upon a time even the member for Ballarat thought that was a good policy. She said two years ago:                 The Government is delivering a surplus with targeted and responsible savings while protecting the frontline services Australians rely on and helping families with cost of living pressures.                 We are doing exactly the same thing.

  I thank the member for Fisher for his question. He recognises how important it is for the economy to have a solid investment program in productivity-enhancing infrastructure. He knows that by building quality infrastructure we can in fact deliver a stronger economy. But you cannot deliver more infrastructure expenditure unless you have the budget under control. It is therefore very important that we introduce the kinds of measures that will give us a sustainable budget so that expenditure on infrastructure can grow and expand.                 One of the important things that are a part of this budget is, clearly, getting rid of the carbon tax. When you have not got a carbon tax, the cost of road building goes down and you are therefore able to achieve much more with your infrastructure expenditure than might otherwise be possible. Of course, the Labor Party is all over the place when it comes to carbon tax. We all remember the former Prime Minister who vowed, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' What a difference there is from the Leader of the Opposition. His vow is, 'There will be a carbon tax under the opposition I lead,' and he will stay a Leader of the Opposition for a long, long time if he buries his head in the sand and does not realise the enormous damage the carbon tax is creating in our economy, the cost to our economy, the cost to jobs and the impact that has on our capacity to build infrastructure.                 The honourable member for Fisher will certainly appreciate the extensive budget to provide for upgrading of our national road system. Like many others, I have been caught in the Sunday afternoon traffic jams between the Fisher electorate and Brisbane. Money needs to be spent on upgrading the Bruce Highway in that area. There is about $2 billion in our infrastructure program committed to improving the highway between the Sunshine Coast and the capital city.                  We are getting on with the job of building the key infrastructure that our nation needs. And we are reversing the reductions in infrastructure expenditure which were a feature of the Labor Party's last years in office. Indeed, the Labor Party, in its last year in office, spent less money on infrastructure than the Howard government spent in its final year in office, six years earlier. We are reversing that decline in expenditure. We are getting on the with job, building the infrastructure that our country needs to service a modern economy - an economy free of carbon tax - and getting on with building stronger job opportunities for all Australians.

  I thank the member for Higgins for her question. I can tell her that because Labor, in government, did nothing about higher education in six years except cut $2.9 billion from the sector, Labor allowed our universities to be overtaken by our competitors, particularly in Asia.                  This government has set on its course, a decision to reform universities to give our higher education sector the opportunity to compete - to give them the freedom they need to have 80,000 more young Australians getting a higher education qualification, and also allowing the universities to set their own course into the future to achieve the excellence that they desire, and compete, particularly with our Asian competitors.                 Labor's approach was to cut without reform. Our approach is to reform higher education because it is a $15 billion export industry for this country. The difference between the coalition and the Labor Party is in the matter of trust. We trust students to make intelligent choices when presented with the opportunity to do so. And we also trust universities to know what is in their best interests and to respond to those best interests.                  I notice that the Leader of the Opposition starts to look a bit uncomfortable when I talk about trust, because he knows what day it is today. A lot of people might have forgotten what day it is today, but I am happy to remind the Leader of the Opposition. I think he knows that it is the first anniversary of the Rudd counter-coup.                 The Leader of the Opposition gets a bit sweaty in the palms when someone starts talking about trust, particularly on a day like today, because in the first coup he was a modern-day Tiberius on a telephone down at the Hong Hau. He was like Fu Manchu, sending instructions to the AWU members of the caucus, wanting everyone to see how much power he had. For the Rudd counter-coup he was cowering in his office hoping that nobody would find out that he was going to rat on the leader. Unfortunately, they found out, and I can say that everyone knows that this Leader of the Opposition - Back-stabber Bill, as he became known - cannot be trusted. His colleagues know it, the public know it -

  In case members opposite have missed it, the member for Fairfax has agreed to support the government's legislation to repeal the carbon tax. That is what he has done.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and note his very keen interest in broadband and in ensuring that his constituents get very fast broadband sooner, cheaper and more affordably. I can announce today that the NBN Co. has finalised commercial negotiations with Telstra for a considerably expanded program to plan, design and construct fibre-to-the-node high-speed broadband which will connect about 200,000 homes and businesses. This is an adrenaline shot for the NBN, and it will show the way to accelerating the rollout that had completely stalled under Labor.                 The member for Blaxland is rarely seen in this chamber. As I said yesterday, he has only asked me one question, and it was about a boat. But he had this to say in an interview with a journalist from ZDNet: 'My main criticism of the NBN project is we haven't rolled it out fast enough. We did it too slow in government.' Gee, you are game enough to take on Senator Conroy, but you are not game enough to ask me a question. He then said, 'This government is still rolling it out too slow.' What we have done with the NBN is we have tripled the number of premises that are connected to the fibre network.                      The number of premises that have been passed with fibre has doubled since September 2013. This fibre-to-the-node rollout, may I add, is not being determined on any sort of electoral geography, as it was under the Labor Party. Twenty-eight per cent of the premises that will get this very fast broadband in the first part of the fibre-to-the-node rollout are underserved premises. That is nearly twice the national average. So we are, as I said, prioritising underserved premises.                 This fibre-to-the-node rollout, this thousand-node rollout with Telstra, will grow and develop into the full large-scale rollout across the network. It includes the electorates of Shortland, Charlton, Dobell, Newcastle, Hinkler, Robertson, Wide Bay, Dickson and, of course, Longman. So honourable members can see that this covers electorates from both sides of the House and it is focused both on engineering practicality and, above all, on need. What we are showing with the restart of the NBN Co is that we are getting on with business. We are fixing this project and we are getting the job done.

  At least some of the assertions in the shadow Treasurer's question are simply untrue. Pensions go up every six months every year. It is true that, along with other unaffordable, unsustainable periodic payments that were put in place by the former government, the seniors supplement will not be continued. We are doing this because it is important to tackle Labor's debt and deficit disaster.                   The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     It is important to tackle Labor's debt and deficit disaster, and the self-funded retirees of Australia - of all people - appreciate the need for prudence. They appreciate the need for frugal government. They appreciate the need for governments - no less than households, families and business - to live within our means. Members opposite are talking about unfairness in this budget. The ultimate unfairness is saddling our children and our grandchildren with $25,000 worth of Commonwealth debt per man, woman and child. That is the ultimate unfairness and that is what this budget is designed to avoid.                 There was a time when the shadow Treasurer thought that surpluses were important. He said, in 2012:                  I think the surplus and our fiscal management has been important in putting downward pressure on interest rates. I think that's one of the great achievements of this government.                  Only it was never achieved, because there was never a surplus. The member for Lilley stood up in this chamber in 2012 and said, 'The four surpluses I announce tonight' - and there were none. But, back then, when there was a skerrick of responsibility to the Labor Party and to members opposite, they appreciated that surpluses count. We know that surpluses count, and that is why we have delivered the budget that we have.

  I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question, because he understands the importance of a well-run migration program that is focused on skills to grow the Australian economy and to create jobs for Australians. What we need to do to ensure this is true is we need to have integrity in the program. To have integrity in the program, it is not enough just to have laws; you have to be prepared to enforce those laws. The people of Australia know that, when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws and our laws on our border, this government has demonstrated that it has what it takes to enforce our laws on the borders. They know that we believe in an immigration program that has integrity and that we believe in borders having integrity.                 The people smugglers know it too - not by what we have said but what we have done. Due to what we have done through Operation Sovereign Borders, there have been more than six months since there has been a successful people smuggling venture to this country. That speaks of the government's resolve to do what is necessary on our borders and to enforce our immigration laws to ensure there is integrity to protect this important program for our nation.                 But stopping the boats is just the start for this government; we are just getting warmed up. When it comes to the threats that are on our border - and there are many - we will show the same resolve, application and leadership in dealing with the threat that terrorist fighters pose to this country and their attempts to radicalise people in our community who would cause a threat to this country. And they know that we will act on the integrity of our immigration program to deal with outlaw motorcycle gangs as well. This is the commitment of this government.                 But we will also act to deal with the threat of those who would seek to rort our migration laws in the workplace. In the first nine months of our government there has been a one-third increase in the level of field inspections to find illegal workers in this country - a one-third increase on our watch. There has been a 20 per cent increase in the location of illegal workers under our enforcement measures and a 190 per cent increase when it comes to warnings. The member for Eden-Monaro and the member for Gilmore will know that recently, in Operation Lever, from Ulladulla to Nowra and from Bega to Merimbula, there were 12 workers identified in cafes and other places as part of those programs.                     The member for Pearce will also know that in Project Tricord, at Carabooda, north of Perth, 122 illegal workers were identified in a partnership operation with the WA Police. We are going to be strong on our borders - whether it is on the borders themselves, in the workplace, fighting the gangs or stopping the terrorist fighters.

  Health spending goes up every year. And, just in case the member opposite is tempted to claim that there have been cuts to public hospitals, public hospital spending goes up nine per cent this year, nine per cent the year after, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent in the fourth year. And school funding goes up eight per cent this year, eight per cent next year, eight per cent the year after that and six per cent in the final year. There have been no cuts to health spending; health spending goes up every year.                     Sure, there are some individual programs that have been adjusted, but our commitment not to cut health spending has been absolutely and utterly delivered upon.

  I think the member for Wannon for his question. I can inform the House that I have today received an update from our ambassador in Baghdad on the conflict in Iraq, including reports of new sectarian massacres committed in northern Iraq by the terrorist organisation ISIL and other extremists. These are appalling reports of mass executions in areas that have come under the sway of ISIL. It is shocking - indeed, beyond comprehension - that some Australian citizens have boasted of being involved in these atrocities, including the murder of Iraqi soldiers. The Australian public must also have been deeply disturbed by the release of a video depicting ISIL fighters urging others to join the conflict, and it was simply chilling to hear one of them speaking with an unmistakable Australian accent. Of the up to 150 Australian citizens involved in Syria and Iraq, here and overseas, some are directly involved in fighting while others are assuming leadership roles in terrorist organisations seeking to radicalise and find new recruits or providing support for logistics and the financing and procurement of weapons. There is no doubt that these extremists pose a major and direct threat to our security. Just as Afghanistan in the 1990s was a breeding ground for terrorists, including those responsible for the Bali bombings which claimed 88 Australian lives, the Syria-Iraq conflict is providing a similar opportunity for extremists who would do us harm.                 To put the current situation in perspective: approximately 30 Australians are believed to have engaged with al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan prior to the NATO-led intervention. With five times that number already believed to be directly engaged in the Syria-Iraq conflict, the risks have increased exponentially. The government recognises this escalating threat and we are taking firm action. There are severe penalties, as I have informed the House, including imprisonment of up to 25 years for a range of terrorist offences. I am taking action, on the advice of our security agencies, by cancelling the passports of those believed to be a security risk.                 Today I spoke at the ANU's Centre of Arab and Islamic Studies and reiterated our commitment to work with our partners in the Middle East to combat the terrorist threat. We are strengthening our partnership with Muslim leaders in Australia and in our region to help articulate the devastating impact of the conflict on the people of the Middle East and to reinforce that it is illegal for any Australian to support terrorist activities. The government will shortly introduce new legislation giving our security agencies greater powers to counter the terrorist threat. The government will not hesitate to take strong action against any person or any group that is a threat to our national security.

  I cannot believe that the shadow minister for education is asking me this question today, because the measures we have taken, regarding making payments to families sustainable, are in part measures that were introduced by the Labor Party. Although the shadow minister in the House walked away from her responsibilities, Labor in the Senate recognised that yes, half of this bill belonged to them.                     Remember - $106 million of childcare rebate, a payment to families, frozen for six years by the Labor Party -                      but not enacted in legislation, so that when we came into government -                      In the fig leaf of economic credibility that the member for Lilley was trying to cover himself with so his last budget did not look quite as awful as it actually was, these savings were announced but never legislated. So we did that. The Labor Party is also walking away from its responsibilities to children and families. We initiated a Productivity Commission inquiry, which is due to report in July in draft form -                      There are no cuts. There is a pausing of the threshold for just three years. The amount of childcare benefit will continue to be indexed on 1 July. The dollar amount of payment will continue to increase.                   The member for Adelaide then left the chamber.                     There is a pause in the threshold for three years. Why are we doing that? Why are we forced to do that? As I said, it does give us no pleasure. We are forced do that because of the unsustainable budget position we inherited from the Labor Party.                 Before the member for Adelaide interrupted, I was pointing out that the Productivity Commission review that points the way to a better future, to a more sustainable future for families, which brings down its draft report next month, was not supported by Labor, was never endorsed by Labor. Labor took no interest in finding policy solutions for the future. In fact, under Labor childcare costs went up 53 per cent. You might say that there are subsidies to assist - and yes, there are - but in the last four years of Labor childcare out-of-pocket costs went up 40 per cent, so families were paying 40 per cent more in the last four years of the Labor government. It is a shameful legacy that we have inherited - one we are managing, fixing and sorting out.

  I thank the member for Swan for that question. I was very pleased to join him recently in his electorate to announce that we would be spending $100,000 in conjunction with the City of Belmont to provide CCTV for the Belmont town centre.                     The member for Swan and I met with a local cafe owner in his electorate who had been repeatedly broken into. The CCTV we are installing will cover the area where his business operates and will act as a deterrent for his business being broken into in this way.                     As the House would be aware, the money we are using for the Safer Streets Program - where the $100,000 for the City of Belmont comes from - is from the confiscated assets account. We are spending it on crime fighting initiatives all around the country. Labor were using it to prop up their dodgy budget.                     The reality is we are spending proceeds of crime money on crime-fighting initiatives all over Australia -                    The member                    for McMahon                    then left the chamber.                     as opposed to what the Labor Party did when they were in office, which was to use this money to prop up their dodgy budget. If we had not made this decision, there would have been $112 million in that account by the financial year 2017-18, money that we are now using to help law enforcement agencies all around Australia do their job.                  The good thing about CCTV is that when it captures footage of people doing the wrong thing it is very hard for them to deny it. The camera never lies. That is why I was a bit surprised after the member for Grayndler said on Tuesday in the House that the Labor Party does not associate with criminals that I came across this photograph of the member for Grayndler associating with notorious criminal Craig Thomson, a man who has been convicted of 65 charges of dishonesty. Sadly, he is not the only one. We have the member for Watson, who likes to holiday in Eddie Obeid's alpine lodge. His defence is that he did not have skiing relations with that man. We have the member for Wills, who was actually a referee for Tony Mokbel. I have plenty of other examples -                  As you know, an imputation against a member is contrary to the standing orders. So, if the minister is imputing to the member who is in a photograph that he is somehow committing an illegal act, that is imputing and reflecting upon the member and is not in accordance with the standing orders. If a minister merely says a photograph exists which has certain people in it, that is not a reflection. So I would ask the minister -                      Thank you for the call, Madam Speaker. We are talking about someone who for three years propped up the former Labor government.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. I withdraw, in the interests of the House. But I have other examples. There is a former president of the Labor Party, Michael Williamson. He is in jail for 7Â½ years for fraud. I will let the evidence speak for itself.

  It is true that this particular supplement has been withdrawn. The problem with this particular supplement -                      When it was introduced by the former government in the 2013 budget, it was estimated to cost $11.7 million. Because the former government was not very good at making these kinds of forecasts, it has ended up costing $110 million, so there has been a tenfold blow-out in expenditure. There has been a tenfold blow-out in expenditure under this supplement. The supplement has therefore been withdrawn, but the government are consulting with the sector to try to ensure that we can bring in a better way of dealing with this particular problem. I table the minister's press release.

  Isn't it great to have a decent member at last representing the people of Wyong and The Entrance and surrounding areas in the Central Coast of New South Wales. I can say to the member for Dobell that, yes, I am aware of the Audit Office report into the Building Better Regional Cities Program. This report is a savage indictment of the incompetence and the partisan pork-barrelling of the previous government. This is a program that had as its target some 8,000 new affordable homes and yet it is expected to deliver no more than 3,200. Indeed, by mid-2016 it will be even less than that - 2,969 homes out of 8,000 that were expected to be delivered under this program. But it is actually worse than that. Do you know how many houses have actually been built of the target of 8,000? Not 3,000, not 2,000, not 1,000; just 247 homes of the target of 8,000.                 This was a $100 million program. I said that this was partisan pork-barrelling. Four out of the five grants went to Labor or Labor aligned electorates under the previous government. So where do you think it went? It went to prop up Craig Thomson in Dobell. It went to prop up the previous member for New England, Tony Windsor, in that seat. As the Audit Office has said today, the minister used - these are the words of the auditor - 'unpublished eligibility criteria', 'implemented in a way that gave insufficient attention to the program's objectives'. That is code from the auditor for this partisan pork-barrelling of this particular program - it gave 'insufficient attention to the program's objectives'. Indeed, the Labor minister at the time, according to the advice of the auditor, ignored the department's advice, and that department's advice was that these program grants were lacking in 'merit' and were not 'value for money'. I wondered which of the six hapless housing ministers under the Labor government might have been responsible for this.                     Yes, one every year - it was a game of housie for the Labor Party. Which of the six hapless housing ministers was responsible for this program? Let's be fair, on this occasion it was not the member for Sydney. She had done enough damage. No, this was the member for Gorton who ignored his department's advice, who made partisan pork-barrelling grants to Labor electorates.

  I certainly stand by my statements that, on average, this is a $550 hit on Australian households every single year. I absolutely stand by my statements. I certainly do not necessarily stand by the distortions of my statements from the Leader of the Opposition. But I do make this point - that is, the Leader of the Opposition loves the carbon tax.                      He just loves it. He's got this smile on his face because every time people's power bills go up there he is, happy that the carbon tax is doing its job.                     I make these fundamental points to the Leader of the Opposition. The carbon tax is a nine per cent impost on power bills. It is a $9 billion handbrake on our economy and it adds $550 a year to the cost of the average Australian household. So every single Australian should be better off when the carbon tax is gone. The Leader of the Opposition is in denial about the impact of the carbon tax on Australian families.                      He is in denial about the result of the last election. The Leader of the Opposition should just, for once, be fair dinkum. He said and all his colleagues said that they would terminate the carbon tax. The chance to terminate the carbon tax is now, and the Leader of the Opposition should make an honest politician of himself and take it.

  I am conscious of the fact that Rockhampton, which the member represents, is the beef capital of Australia and beef will certainly be one of the biggest beneficiaries from the free-trade agreement we have signed with Japan. Last week Prime Minister Abe and I did, in fact, sign the Economic Partnership Agreement that the member refers to. For 40 years Japan was Australia's biggest trading partner. It is still, by a wide margin, our second-biggest trading partner, and two-way trade between Australia and Japan is worth $70 billion every single year, and Japan is also our third-biggest inbound investor. Japan has been central to Australia's post-war prosperity. Our iron ore, our coal and, more recently, our gas industries would not have happened but for Japanese buyers and investors; in a very real sense, our post-war prosperity has been made in Japan.                  This free-trade agreement we have just signed with Japan is good news for businesses and for consumers because freer trade means more jobs and lower prices. It is, in fact, the first comprehensive free-trade agreement that Japan has signed with a major developed economy and, under it, 97 per cent of Australia's exports to Japan will enter duty-free or at a preferential rate when the agreement is fully enforced. Beef, cheese, horticulture and wine will particularly benefit. Beef tariffs will almost halve, with a big drop immediately. That is why the red meat council thinks that our beef exports to Japan will increase by some seven per cent a year under this agreement.                 The BCA said:                 'The Australian Government has been focused and pragmatic in concluding the highest-quality bilateral trade agreement Japan has ever signed.                 'This agreement will give Australian exporters better access to the $5 trillion Japanese market than Japan has provided under any other of its trade agreements.'                     Obviously, I thank the trade minister, Andrew Robb, for his tireless work to bring this about. This is a government which seeks to deliver on its commitments. We said before the last election that within 12 months we wanted to finalise free-trade agreements with Korea, with Japan and with China. Two of those agreements have, indeed, been finalised and we have high hopes of a third, thanks again to the good work of Minister Robb.

  Why won't the Leader of the Opposition stand by his promise and terminate the carbon tax? What kind of a fibber is the Leader of the Opposition when he refuses to terminate the carbon tax he repeatedly promised?                     When the carbon tax goes -                      I withdraw.                     I simply ask the Leader of the Opposition to do what he said he would do pre-election and terminate the carbon tax.                     Let me quote, for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, the Chairman of the ACCC, Rod Sims, who said of the repeal of the carbon tax:                 What went up will clearly come down when you take away the carbon price.                 And for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, again let me quote Rod Sims:                 It's not a massively complicated process. Electricity prices went up fairly quickly on the way up and they will go down fairly immediately on the way down.                 So there it is: what went up with the carbon tax will come down when the carbon tax comes off. And I say to the Leader of the Opposition: come out of denial, do after the election what you said you would do before the election and terminate the carbon tax.

  It is a very good question. In fact, a couple of weeks ago the Minister for Trade and I met with the most senior economic minister in China, and in his opening statement he said how important it was for Australia to abolish the carbon tax and the mining tax. The most senior economic minister in China, who is responsible for dealing with carbon emissions in China, praised Australia's abolition of the carbon tax. And I say to you: that reflects the importance to the economy of the abolition of the carbon tax, because while it remains in place it costs Australia $11 million every day. Repealing the carbon tax will not only save business $85 million a year but it will also boost competitiveness for 76,000 entities that will no longer have to comply with a carbon tax.                 The bottom line is we will strengthen the Australian economy by abolishing the carbon tax, and that means more jobs and better economic security. It makes us a more competitive nation. It was identified by the Prime Minister of Canada, when he and this Prime Minister jointly stated how important it was to get rid of carbon tax.                     Stephen Harper in case you do not know. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: he must recognise that next Wednesday is a historic day. This coming Wednesday is a historic day not because it is the anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11 - or the birth of the parking meter for those who are interested in trivia; next Wednesday is the first anniversary of the Townsville termination. That was the famous press conference where the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the member for McMahon stood there and said, 'Today is the day the Labor Party is terminating the carbon tax.' The Townsville termination. We cannot forget that moment. The member for McMahon was there: he was like Robin standing next to Batman, wearing the face mask, claiming, 'I'll be right there with you, Batman.' In fact, the only termination the Leader of the Opposition is familiar with is the termination of Julia Gillard, the termination of Kevin Rudd the first time, and he put Kevin Rudd back into the prime ministership to terminate the carbon tax.                 Yet, today is going to be the third day that the Labor Party has indeed voted against the termination of the carbon tax. So they said before the election that they would terminate the carbon tax, and on every occasion since the election they have voted to keep the carbon tax. There is one lesson we can get out of this, one thing you can be absolutely sure of -                      no matter what Labor does at this very moment, at the next election, should they win, they will want to reintroduce the carbon tax, they will want to punish the Australian economy.

  Madam Speaker, of course I stand by my statements, and, yes, the cost of building a new home will fall very significantly once the carbon tax is abolished. The Leader of the Opposition knows this very well -                      because before the last election, the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues put out a brochure all around Australia. 'Kevin Rudd and Labor remove the carbon tax'. It is like they ended the deficit as well. They abolished the carbon tax like they ended the deficit.                 But here it is, a document that the Labor Party distributed right around Australia, and they make all sorts of claims. Interest rates, they say they reduced those - I doubt that. School expenses, they say they reduced - well I certainly doubt that!                     Child care they claim is '50 per cent off'; in fact, childcare costs rose by 73 per cent during the life of the former government. And then it says, 'Carbon tax abolished'.' I am not making it up. Here it is in black and white; a brochure from Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party. It is here in red, white and blue in fact!                     It is here in red, white and blue from Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party: 'Carbon tax abolished'. Kevin Rudd and Labor removed the carbon tax! Well, I do not know what they have been doing since the election. If they removed the carbon tax since the election, why have they been voting for it after the election - three times? Methinks I thought the cock crowed! Three times this morning! Really and truly, hypocrisy, thy name is Labor: in denial about the election result, in denial about the debt and deficit disaster and in denial about the damage the carbon tax does. I table, for the benefit of members opposite, this document.

  I thank very much the member for Denison for his question. As he points out, the government has announced a feasibility study in relation to Australian Hearing Services, because I want to make sure that we are getting money away from bureaucratic services and back to front-line services including and, in particular, in hearing, as the honourable member refers to.                     The honourable member makes mention of the budget. In this budget we increase spending in health in each of the years in the forward estimates. We increase health spending and hospital spending. Hospital spending goes up by nine per cent next year, the year after and the year after that, and then 6Â½ per cent in the year after that. We have provided a lot of support to front-line services in this budget and we are very proud of it.                 The Labor Party presided over this great mushrooming of bureaucracies within the Health portfolio over the course of their six years. We want to make sure that we can get money back to doctors and nurses and deliverers of health services so that we can get more patients seen. That is the desire of this government and that is what we achieve.                     The member for Denison was able to broker an arrangement with former Prime Minister Gillard in relation to a hospital within Tasmania. Unfortunately, much of that money was spent and the hospital was never built. That is the difficulty that Labor presided over. They spent enormous amounts of money away from front-line services. The contrast could not be starker and we will provide additional services to the Australia public because we will not waste money on great big new Labor bureaucracies.

  I want to thank the member for Bonner, who went to the last election with a very simple proposition: to fight to remove the carbon tax to reduce electricity prices for his constituents. But it is also a pleasure, may I say, to finally receive another question on the environment from our side. I believe that is 30 questions so far on the environment from our side of the House and none - nothing on dugongs and turtles, nothing on Reef Trust, nothing on Green Army, nothing on the Murray-Darling Basin agreement.                 But let me deal precisely with the issue of reducing electricity costs by removing a tax which does not work, because, like the Prime Minister, we have been doing our research. Today, I came across a very interesting newsletter. The newsletter is dated 'Winter 2013, Issue No. 2' and is 'Community News, Mark Butler MP, Federal Member for Port Adelaide'. And do you know what it says? Not just once but twice, it has a headline 'Carbon tax terminated'. It is not in future tense, not intention, but past tense: done, finished, complete. He asked me to read out. I would very happily read out the quote. Here is what the member for Port Adelaide says, quoting the then Prime Minister:                 The government has decided to terminate the carbon tax to help cost-of-living pressures for families and to reduce costs for small business.                 In other words, all of this talk about what a great and wondrous measure it is is belied by the fact that in winter last year -                      when people were shivering through winter, when they were paying electricity bills, when they were paying gas bills -                      the member for Port Adelaide and his then government were telling Australians not that they would terminate the carbon tax but that it had been terminated. What happens this week when we terminate the carbon tax?                      In Queensland the Competition Authority has made it absolutely clear that there will be an 8.5 per cent decrease in the average bill on a regulated basis - in other words, this has to happen; it is a Queensland regulation. And that means $1.5 billion of lower costs for Queensland businesses. It means lower cost of living for Queensland families. But throughout this time the ALP have stood in the way of doing what they said. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to honour what you said at the last election. It is time to honour what you demanded last Friday when you said the government should be allowed to carry through their promises. It is time to get out of the way.

  Madam Speaker, you would think that this would be a man who would be too embarrassed to ask a question after the last answer. This is the tax that he had already abolished. This is the tax that members opposite claim to have abolished, but, far from abolishing the carbon tax, members opposite are consistently voting to keep it even though they know that it is adding massively to the costs of businesses and significantly and substantially to the costs of every household in Australia. This is the problem: the Labor Party just does not get it.                     I absolutely guarantee that the farmers of Australia will be massively better off without this tax. Some of them will benefit by much more than $12,000. What hypocrisy we see from members opposite. They are now supporting a tax cut that they abandoned in government, they are opposing savings that they supported in government and they are supporting the tax that they thought they had abolished in government. Really and truly, no-one can take this Labor Party seriously. They do not believe anything, they do not stand for anything, they have no confidence or competence in saying or doing anything -                      Once upon a time there were Labor leaders who did stand for things, who did believe in things and who did do good things for our country. This particular Labor Party were wreckers in government and now they are wreckers in opposition.

  I thank the honourable member for his question - he knows that every day this carbon tax is in place it is adding to the costs of Australian families, Australian industry, Australian business, Australian farmers and the people of his electorate. The cost of the carbon tax is now $25.40 per tonne. Yes, while parliament was away for a week the tax went up. If it stays in place, as Labor now wishes, it will go up every year - it will continue to go up. This is the tax that Labor knew before the last election was hurting business, was hurting families. They knew it was hurting, that it was costing jobs. That is why they terminated it, they said. They terminated this tax that was hurting Australians and hurting Australian families. We also made a commitment in opposition that on election to government we would get rid of this tax. The difference between one side and the other is that we are getting on with the job of getting rid of the tax. Labor has changed its mind again, and now wants to keep this tax. They want to keep a tax that keeps costing Australian jobs, that makes Australian industry uncompetitive and that adds $550 to the costs of every Australian household.                  This is a tax that was evil before the election - Labor knew it then; it is even bigger now, so it is even more evil - but all of a sudden Labor has decided that the carbon tax should stay. Labor continues to vote against the reform - the reform they promised to deliver before the election; reform of a tax they know is hurting Australia. Every day they delay is costing Australian householders $11 million. It keeps on going up. Of course the impact of the carbon tax has been much greater than that cost. The impact to the economy is estimated at around $15.4 billion in the first year in lost jobs, in lost opportunities. Labor got it right with their Townsville termination announcement - the tax has to go. It is hurting Australians, and it is now time that Labor honoured its commitment in Townsville to the people of Australia. They should get rid of this tax and let our country start working properly again.

  I invite the member who asked the question to vote this week to terminate the carbon tax, because certainly that should mean that the price of a leg of lamb will come down. If members opposite keep voting to keep the carbon tax and, if the carbon tax stays under members opposite, the carbon tax would just go up and up and up and eventually - who knows? - may be there would have been a $100 leg of lamb. I am inviting members opposite to do the right thing by the lamb consumers and producers of Australia and vote to terminate the carbon tax.

  I thank the member for Moore - what a distinguished member he is. I have some good news. If this parliament can support the Abbott government's Economic Action Strategy, we will abolish the carbon tax. But we need to get the parliament behind us. I say to the member for Moore that for the households and businesses in Edgewater, Kinross, Joondalup we are working for their interest because the abolition of the carbon tax will support all of those communities and, in fact, communities right across the country. It has been a key element of our Economic Action Strategy and is part of our plan to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure future.                 It is evident that the Leader of the Opposition and Labor have no plans -                    The member for Moreton then                    left the chamber                   .                     They were incompetent in government and they are irresponsible in opposition. As the member for Moreton leaves, I can remind those members opposite how Labor went around claiming they had terminated the carbon tax, but, by their actions in opposition, that Townsville termination has become an escalation. Labor's decision to impede this government's efforts to repeal the carbon tax has actually seen the tax go up; and that has meant $550 on average of additional expense for Australian households. In New South Wales gas is up to 9.2 per cent higher than it needs to be because of the carbon tax. In Queensland the cost for a typical household electricity bill would fall by 8.5 per cent. In Tasmania, we have seen a 7.8 per cent real fall; in the ACT - in this capital - would have a fall of 11.6 per cent in electricity prices if we could abolish the carbon tax.                 As the Prime Minister has made clear and as our consumer protector has made clear, there is a lot of noise - this is what Rod Simms had to say - going around with lots of complicated questions, but at its heart, when the carbon tax came in, it increased prices. When you take it away, the effect will be reversed. What we have done is finance the ACCC not only with an extra $89 million of emergency funding over the forward estimates but an additional $10 million to make sure that the savings from the carbon tax repeal are passed on. There are price-monitoring powers, and we have already seen the first carbon-monitoring report published on 1 May under the government's direction. The government's plan makes it absolutely clear: it will prohibit any company, including supermarkets, from making false or misleading representations about the impact of the carbon tax on the prices they charge. We put strong safeguards in place.                 As my friend and colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has mentioned, in discussions with the Senate, those strong safeguards will be strengthened even further. It is now up to all of us to do - not only for the member for Moore's community, but for households and businesses right across Australia - is repeal this carbon tax. Let's axe the tax, not terminate it, as you claimed, because you are escalating it by standing in the way of this important measure.

  I am delighted to get a series of questions from the opposition on the carbon tax, because when it comes to the carbon tax we are against it and after the election we are doing what we said we would do before the election. They are for it and they are acting completely contrary to what they said they would do before the election. Let's be absolutely crystal clear: if you get rid of the carbon tax, you remove a nine per cent impost on power prices, a $9 billion a year hand break on our economy and a $550-a-year hit on the average household. We want to save the average household money; that is why we want to terminate the carbon tax. We will not just claim that we will terminate the carbon tax, we will. We will not rest until this toxic tax is gone. Even if it does go this week as it should, members opposite will want to bring it back.                     They will want it back because they are so convinced that this carbon tax is good for you, Madam Speaker. It is very, very clear that we are against the carbon tax and we want lower prices -                      The member interjecting loves the carbon tax, and just wait until she has got rid of the Leader of the Opposition, she will be telling us every day how good the carbon tax. If they win the next election, the carbon tax will be back with all its toxicity, all its ugliness and all its damage to the Australian jobs and the Australian cost of living.

  I would like to thank the honourable member for the question. Bert the Beattie beater went to the last election promising to fix the mess and to fix the budget. And that is exactly what we are doing: we are fixing the budget. We laid down as a task to repair the massive disrepair left by the Labor Party, because that is part of our Economic Action Strategy. Getting rid of the carbon tax is part of our Economic Action Strategy to help to create more jobs and a stronger and more competitive economy. Getting rid of the mining tax is part of our plan, our Economic Action Strategy, to build a stronger economy and a more competitive economy. Fixing the budget is part of our Economic Action Strategy to create a stronger economy - a more competitive economy with more jobs.                  That is backed up by a number of statements that have been issued by respected economic commentators and decision makers over the last few weeks. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, warned on Saturday:                 _ by the time these sorts of problems have gone from being out on the horizon to on our doorstep, they have usually become a lot more difficult to tackle.                 He went on to say:                 We shouldn't leave it -                  budget repair -                  until the gaps emerge _                 The Governor of the Reserve Bank, in a rare public statement of this type, has supported what the government has decided - to take action now to repair the budget so the Australian community does not have to face massive bills and punitive measures in a few years time.                 The Labor Party is in denial. Before the last election, they said the budget needed to be repaired. After the election, they said, 'There is no budget that needs to be repaired; everything is just hunky-dory' - and they are opposing everything they possibly can. That is despite the fact that, in opposition, we supported 80 per cent of their savings - and then we added $50 billion on top of that to make sure the budget was in even better shape. The Labor Party is opposing 80 per cent of our savings, and they are the ones with 25 senators across the way voting against budget repair. It is not three members of the Palmer United Party; it is not even the 10 Greens; it is the 25 Labor senators over there who are voting against budget repair, the budget repair the Secretary of the Treasury says must be done now. Moody's rating agency also said it must be done now. Even John Edwards, a former adviser to the Labor Party, said:                 I've no doubt there is a budget crisis.                  Do not believe me; believe your own former advisors. Get out of the way of us fixing the budget now.

  I thank the member for Brisbane for her question. I look forward to going to her electorate during the winter recess to visit several childcare centres and service providers. I know of her keen interest in this subject. I can confirm that several weeks ago I initiated an increase in the active compliance of the Commonwealth Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance program, known to us in this place as JET. This is part of a broader approach by this government to stepping up childcare compliance, making it much stronger, and implementing tighter program guidelines after years of slipping standards and inaction under the previous Labor government.                  Under Labor, in each of two consecutive years the budget for JET blew out by almost $30 million - and they did absolutely nothing about it. Without the action we have taken, the budget for JET was forecast to blow out a further $240 million over the next four years. It has been clear for some time now that the program has been subject to exploitation by a small but expanding network of family day care services and parents engaging in sharp practices. It is only a small proportion, but unfortunately the dollars were very large. These sharp practices include services charging excessive fees and claiming for hours of care not delivered, parents claiming more child care than they need to complete their study or training commitments, and parents continuing to claim JET despite no longer participating in, or having completed, their study or training. This program is not there to be abused by dodgy services looking to make an easy buck or parents using more care than they need to complete their commitments - just because taxpayers are footing the bill. It is just not on. As I said, we are going to increase active compliance checks.                 The core issue here, however, is that Labor were well aware of these sharp practices and did absolutely nothing about it. They threw it in the too-hard basket. They sat on their hands while the rorting grew and the budget blow-outs ballooned. You would think it was quite a simple concept: here is the budget, the year progresses and then the money runs out - what do you do? I tell you what Labor did: they just topped it up. They just found more money on the national credit card, topped up the budget and kept spending. You would think that sensible economic managers would ask: 'What is actually going on here? What is going on with this program? Are people not spending the money properly? Are there things we need to look into?' But they did not do that. Instead, when the money ran out, they just topped it up. What else would you expect from a Labor government? I was there on the opposition benches when Kevin Rudd came into office and the government had net assets of $45 billion - and I was there on the opposition front bench when Kevin Rudd left office and the government had net debt of $162 billion.

  We said we would abolish the carbon tax, and that is exactly what we are doing - we are putting the abolition bill through the parliament. Members opposite keep saying that the government should honour its commitments, and that is exactly what we are doing. No thanks to the opposition, though - not only is the opposition trying to stop us from honouring our commitments, but it is trying to stop us from honouring their own commitments - the tax cut that they had abandoned; the savings that they promised and are now opposing; and of course the carbon tax that they said they had abolished, and that they now love. We are being absolutely faithful to the commitments we made to the public pre-election, and it is high time the Labor Party was, too.

  I thank the member for Dawson for his question. In the break I was pleased to be in his electorate, and also the member for Capricornia's electorate. I was hosted by Michelle Landry, the excellent new member for Capricornia, at the University of Central Queensland at the launch of the newly-emerged Central Queensland TAFE and Central Queensland University into a dynamic new institution led by a dynamic vice chancellor, Scott Bowman. He wants to grasp the opportunities that higher education reform will bring in the budget. In fact, at the launch with the member for Capricornia, Scott Bowman said, 'we are licking our lips about higher education reforms, because we are a lick-smackingly good university.' That is the kind of attitude the government is looking for from the university sector - to grasp the opportunity for freedom this government plans to give them.                 The previous government were incompetent in government and are irresponsible in opposition. Under the previous government there was a declining university sector. When we won power last September we saw there were declining results for our universities around the world - in fact on the Shanghai Jiao Tong index, most of our institutions were falling behind, some were flatlining and one or two exceptions were doing better than they had before. The government was faced with the prospect of our universities falling behind in a slow decline, like our manufacturing sector.                     We had to choose between doing what Labor did - which was just to keep kicking the can down the road, being incompetent and now irresponsible - or grasping the opportunity to do something about higher education in Australia. Grasp that opportunity we did - and we want to give our university sector the freedom that they need to be able to compete globally against our Asian competitors. We are going to give them the freedom to put a value on their best courses, so they can keep doing the things they do well, and do them even better and invest the extra resources they gain into research. We will give them the freedom to make the decisions about what they do well, and what they do not want to continue to do into the future. We want to give them the freedom to draft their own scholarships fund so they can have packages that attract the best and brightest students from around Australia of low socio-economic status and to give them the opportunity to get a higher education qualification. The difference between us and Labor could not be more stark. Whereas this side of the government wants to spread opportunity and give the universities the chance to compete globally, Labor wants to keep being irresponsible. Just as they were incompetent in government, they are irresponsible in opposition - it goes on and on.

  As the member who asked the question knows, those amendments were actually withdrawn. The matter has been reworked over the weekend, and I am confident that we have got the balance right.                     A whole range of people have been consulted over the weekend, including the Australian Industry Group -                      On that basis I am confident that the carbon tax repeal legislation will not only be massively beneficial for business costs and will massively reduce business costs, but it will very substantially reduce household expenses, and substantially reduce red tape and compliance. That is what this government wants to do - bring business costs down, bring families' cost of living down and bring red tape down. That is why the sooner we terminate the carbon tax, the better for everyone.

  I thank the member for his question, and for his ongoing interest in making sure that our country has a sustainable health system not just for today, but for the decades ahead. One of the great aspects of the health system in this country is the PBS - the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The way in which it operates, as people know, is that, when they get a script from a doctor and then go to see a pharmacist, they pay a contribution. For many Australians, they pay just over $6 for each and every medicine, regardless of their assets, regardless of their income. If they have a healthcare card and are eligible for a concessional arrangement, for every script from the first script, unlike bulk-billing, they get that script filled by the pharmacist and, in some cases, those medicines on an individual basis can cost thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars, which is ultimately paid for by the taxpayer. So we have to have a system which is sustainable in relation to our medicines. We have taken the judgement that to make our MBS - the system where we pay our doctors - sustainable, we also need to apply that same principle and adopt a co-payment so that we can have a sustainable Medicare into the future.                  The interesting thing is that the Labor Party have supported the co-payment in relation to the PBS since the 1960s. We know that they supported it in relation to those who were general patients, without a concession, back in the 1960s. We know it was the Labor Party that in 1986 increased the co-payment for general patients by 100 per cent - from $5 to $10. They argued at the time that the co-payment was necessary to keep the PBS sustainable so that, as new drugs came on line, we could afford to list those drugs. They said, yes, even people on low incomes can afford a relatively modest amount by way of a co-payment. We have applied, as I say, the same principle for when people go to see a general practitioner. The difference is that, when people go to see a doctor, we are saying that, if they cannot afford the $7, we will still bulk-bill but not in as many cases as bulk-billing applies at the moment. We know that, at the moment, 83 per cent of Australians - or 83 per cent of those services - are bulk-billed when they go to see a doctor, but it is not sustainable. Bulk-billing is about providing support to those who cannot afford to provide for themselves. Bulk-billing is not about doctors trying to take market share from the doctor on the diagonal corner; it is about a safety net.                    The member for Griffith then left the chamber.                     The Labor Party, when they had principles, supported a co-payment for the PBS and they even introduced the co-contribution for those on concession cards. The Labor Party, at some stage, are going to have to explain how it is they could afford to give everything for free and rack it up on the country's credit card. The opposition have no credibility when it comes to health or the economy.

  I thank the member for Casey for his question. I was just with him over a week ago and I know the keen interest of his constituents in these matters. The government is investing in stronger borders and that investment begins with investing in the right policies to protect our borders - and those policies are getting results. Those results include a 35 per cent reduction in the number of children held in detention in this country and at our offshore processing centres - a 35 per cent reduction from 1,342 at the time of the election down to 861 at this time. There has been the freeing up of 20,000 places in our offshore humanitarian program over five years. There have been no deaths at sea since last September. There have been no successful people-smuggling ventures to Australia in almost seven months.                    The member for Corio then left the chamber.                     I notice that the member for Corio was not prepared to ask me a question today; rather, he has just come to the dispatch box again to chuck another hissy fit and leave the chamber so he would not have to ask me a question. If he has got a question, come into the House and ask me one.                    The member for Lingiari then left the chamber.                     All of those things have delivered $2Â½ billion of savings in this budget. That is the dividend of stronger border protection. Today we announced further investment in stronger borders through the establishment of the National Border Targeting Centre, and that was supported not just by the establishment of the centre with $30 million but by a $250 million investment in the broader intelligence and systems capabilities that make such a centre tick so that we could integrate the agencies. Nine specific agencies have now been brought together under a strategic border command, not just to deal with people-smuggling threats but to deal with the issues of terrorism, with the issues of transnational crime and with the many other threats on our borders for those who may seek to do this country harm.                  What we have seen from those opposite this past fortnight is a retreat even beyond the weakness of their policies in government when it comes to issues on our border. What we have seen them do is walk away from the enhanced screening policy that they actually pursued in government and supported. They are now weaker in opposition on border protection than when they were in government, which is quite an achievement for them to be putting in place. They want to reintroduce the water taxi service. That is the implication of what the opposition have been saying for the last fortnight: people should be water-taxied to Australia rather than turning boats back where it is safe to do so, which is the policy of this government.

  I am absolutely delighted to get question after question from the Labor Party on the carbon tax, because they support the carbon tax and we oppose it. We want to scrap the carbon tax; they want to keep it. We told the truth about the carbon tax before the election and they did not. They claimed not just that they had terminated the thing but that they had abolished it. Let me say again, the Labor Party abolished the carbon tax in the same way that the Labor Party abolished the deficit. Absolute, total, complete frauds, that is what members opposite are on this matter.                     Let me be absolutely crystal clear, yet again -                      Let me be absolutely crystal clear, every time cabinet meets we reiterate our opposition to the carbon tax and our determination to see the back of the carbon tax as quickly as possible, because the carbon tax is a nine per cent impost on power prices, a $9 billion a year handbrake on the economy, a $550 a year hit on the average household's cost of living.                     For all these reasons, every time the cabinet meet we say, 'Lets get rid of the carbon tax.' Unlike members opposite, when we meet we do not say to ourselves, 'Will we terminate or abolish it?'. We do it. We do not play games with the carbon tax. We do not say we are against it before the election and love it after the election. We always thought the carbon tax was absolutely toxic. It was bad policy based on a lie. That is what it was; that is what it is. We are against it; Labor are for it. We will get rid of it as soon as we humanly can.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I can confirm that for the first time in its history the National Broadband Network project, NBN Co, has actually met, indeed it has exceeded, a target. Under the previous administration, of course, one target after another was set only to be missed. At 30 June this year the NBN passed 492,000 premises with fibre; the target set shortly after the election was 467,000 premises. That is a very big change.                     The honourable member for Grayndler during the period that he likes to refer to as the golden age of communications, that brief period when he was the minister just before the election - he has promised me a question about that, one day; I am still waiting for it - was in the Lateline studio with me. In the course of an interview he said that the NBN was on time and on budget. At that time, just before the election, the Labor government were promising that by 30 June this year it was going to pass 1.3 million premises. They knew that even the NBN Co under their management knew that it was not going to do that, because they had on their desk a write down of that target, just as the 1.3 million had been a write-down of the target before, of about 400,000. It was a classic case of cascading targets falling one after the other. They were hopelessly incompetent in government and are now irresponsible in opposition, because they are failing to adjust to the reality of the current situation, which is getting this project back on track. We are doing that with competent management, a competent board and transparency that matches that of a public listed company. Every quarter the NBN's financials are published. Every six months there is a full analyst briefing.                     I hear the member for Chifley interjecting. He was one of the great advocates of NBN Co. He was part of the fibre-to-the-premises cult, which ignored actually connecting anybody. All they wanted to do was get fibre to the press release and - oh boy! - they got that. They got fibre to more press releases than any government in the history of the Commonwealth. But what we have done is get fibre to more customers than any other government. In fact, there are three times as many customers connected to the NBN as there were at the time of the last election. That is real action, real progress; the mark of a grown-up government of real competence.

  I thank the member for Corio for his question. As the member will know, these matters are currently before the High Court and the government has made some statements to the High Court about these matters.                      I will wait for silence, Madam Speaker.                      Madam Speaker, this is a very serious matter -                      This venture which we have identified to the High Court is one that demonstrates, I think, the nature in which this government seeks to deal with these issues in terms of people smuggling to Australia. I have said very clearly to this House that this government has had significant success in dealing with these matters. The reason we have had that success is that we have been adamant that, on every occasion that may present, we will apply all of the policies we have to ensure that no venture successfully reaches Australia. Those are the policies that we are applying, whether it is in this instance or in any other instance. I know that those opposite like to denigrate the fact that there has been no successful people-smuggling venture to Australia in seven months, but it means that there has been no loss of life for people at sea as a result of those ventures since last September.                      As I said, the matter is before the court and the government is not going to expand on the issues or the responses we have already made to the court as it considers these matters. But I can assure this House that those men and women who serve as part of our Customs and Border Protection Service, who serve as part of the Australian Navy under Border Protection Command, conduct themselves with the utmost professionalism, with the utmost compassion, and that is what they are doing today, that is what they will do tomorrow and that is what they were doing yesterday. They are ensuring that any persons who are in their care are well looked after, because that is the nature of the people that we have put our trust in on our borders. I know they, like those on this side of the House, want to see an end to the despicable trade that flourished under the previous government.                     In July of last year, 48 vessels -                      I can understand why the Manager of Opposition Business would not want me to refer to July of last year, because when he was minister in July of last year 48 boats turned up, as you know. Over 4Â½ thousand people turned up on your watch in July of last year, and over 16 people died last July that we know of. This government will never return to the chaos and the madness and the tragedy that that former minister presided over, that that former minister there presided over and that that former minister over there presided over - never, ever.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for her question, because this is a significant week. Australia has had the world's biggest carbon tax and now there is a chance, now there is an opportunity, to get rid of it. Labor opposite apparently still want to keep this tax. Once more, in spite of the Townsville termination statement, they are determined to bring it back, if ever given another chance.                  What Australian people want is an end to this tax, which is costing jobs. At least 120,000 jobs have been lost in Australia since Labor introduced the carbon tax. The tax is adding to the cost of living. It is adding to the cost of everything we do in this country. Getting rid of it will save the average householder $550 a year. It will make Australian industry more competitive. It will give us the opportunity to build on our nation's strength, without having to carry this extra burden that our competitors around the world simply do not have to live with. Electricity prices will go down by about nine per cent and everybody will therefore be better off in that regard. It will be cheaper to run your refrigerator, cheaper to run your heaters or your air-conditioners. It will help those who are building roads or manufacturing goods in this country. These are all benefits that will flow through to the Australian economy. As a result, we will once again have the chance to become competitive.                 It should come as no surprise to Labor that the carbon tax has increased the cost of living and has cost jobs in this country. The very design of the tax was intended to raise the cost of doing business, of using electricity. It was a deliberate strategy to hurt people, to hurt them so much, the theory was, that they would turn off their lights at night rather than use electricity, that they would not undertake manufacturing in this country. That is a foolish policy that has damaged Australia's economy. Of course, if Labor ever gets the opportunity again to introduce a carbon tax it will not be at the current price of $25.40. Their projected figure is $38 rising to $350 over the life of their scheme. That is an unsatisfactory impost on Australian business, and the sooner we get rid of it the better. Labor has its chance for the third time this week in the Senate to vote to get rid of this tax and let Australians get on with their lives.

  There is a lot of irony in that question from the member for Sydney. She presided over the ripping of millions and millions of dollars away from frontline services and putting them into great big new Labor health bureaucracies. When we came into government the department had over 5,000 people and 21 outside agencies, many of which had grown under Labor's six failed years of government. The shadow minister, the minister at the time, who now aspires to occupy permanently the chair of the Leader of the Opposition, wants to talk about her record on health. Her record on health is absolutely appalling. Let me explain why.                     This dream team will go nowhere - that is my prediction. You failed under the Rudd-Gillard years. You have all the loyalty of Julia Gillard. That would be my projection. In relation to hospital funding - she does not want to hear it!                     I will come to hospital funding in a second, but in relation to nurses - I am very happy to talk about nurses - we went to the election promising 500 new scholarships over the next three years for nurses and allied health care workers.                     Why do you scoff at that? You would prefer to spend money on GP superclinics, half of which have never opened six years later?                     We took that money away from superclinics and we took other money Labor was wasting and we are putting it into nurses. We have increased the number of places for training GPs over the coming years. We took money away from Labor's bureaucracies and we put it into frontline services.                 What have we done in relation to hospitals? Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition, as she wants to be, that we are increasing hospital funding across the Commonwealth by nine per cent over the course of the next 12 months. What will we do in the year beyond? We are going to increase it by nine per cent. What will we do the year beyond that? We are going to increase it by nine per cent. And in the fourth year we will increase hospital funding by 6Â½ per cent. We increase health spending in this budget and every budget as we go forward, but we are not going to do it in the way in which Labor did.                     The people of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, in particular, know the way in which Labor governments ran their hospital systems at a state level and they got a taste of it over the last six years. They take money away from frontline services -                      and they give it to the unions in these great big health bureaucracies. We will not fall for that. We will not fall for those stupid mistakes. We will not make the mistakes that the member for Sydney made when she was the health minister. We will take money and we will put it into nurses and we will put it into doctors. We will make Medicare sustainable. We will not go down the failed path of Labor. People know that at the next election they will have a choice to make between getting more money into health, which is what we on this side of the House provide, or signing themselves up again to the failed health system that Labor presided over for six years.

  The world's biggest carbon tax, you say. We are keeping to our election commitment to get rid of the world's biggest carbon tax. The Labor Party, unfortunately, is not keeping to its election commitment to terminate the world's biggest carbon tax.                     There are teeth moving over there but I cannot see the face. There is something moving - lots of chompers. Tomorrow is the first anniversary of the Townsville termination, when the member for McMahon and the former Prime Minister went up to Townsville and proudly proclaimed that the Labor Party was going to terminate the carbon tax. If Labor was re-elected they were going to terminate the carbon tax. The only problem is that, coming into opposition, Labor is now determined to oppose the termination of the carbon tax. Why? I found out why today. Outside Parliament House, in words that would ring true to everything Labor does -                      the member for McMahon said, in relation to the carbon tax: 'The Labor Party's position will remain consistent and clear.' We are not sure if that was the original position in relation to an ETS, or whether it was the revised position in relation to a carbon tax, or whether it was the revised position on terminating the carbon tax - or who knows what their position is today?                     But we are getting rid of the carbon tax because it is a cost to Australian jobs. We are getting rid of the carbon tax because it is a handbrake on Australia's economic growth. We are getting rid of the carbon tax because it increases inflation in Australia. We are getting rid of the carbon tax because it reduces our competitive position in relation to a whole range of other countries that we compete with every day in trade and commerce. We are getting rid of the carbon tax so that we can deal directly with the cost-of-living challenges for everyday Australian families. We are getting rid of the carbon tax because the carbon tax is a failed policy. It is flawed policy.                 How ironic it is that, after yesterday addressing every question to the carbon tax and after opposing the repeal of the carbon tax on three occasions, today the Labor Party are not even asking a question. They are going to have to defend the carbon tax not just yesterday but for every day up to the next election and beyond, because the carbon tax and the Labor Party are one and the same.

  This is an important topic and, as Kevin Rudd worked out when he was Prime Minister, he needed to fix the health system. Prime Minister Rudd at the time and, to her credit, Prime Minister Gillard commissioned two independent reports - first, the Bennett review and, second, the McKeon review - both of which independently came back to the then Labor government saying that our current health system in this country, with an ageing population, is unsustainable, in their own words. That was not our claim and not Labor's claim; it was the independent advice commissioned by Labor when they were in government.                     That went back to Prime Minister Rudd. I believe that Prime Minister Rudd would have done something about the health system if he had not been chopped off at the knees. If you had not bashed him up and sent him to hospital, he would have had the opportunity to do something about health, but he never did that.                 We know that, back in the Hawke years, when we had a responsible Labor government and a responsible Labor opposition, they supported sensible changes and, indeed, at that stage, they implemented a co-payment because, at the time, as Bob Hawke said, if you want to make Medicare sustainable, people have to make a small contribution.                     The way in which we have approached this task is to make Medicare sustainable.                     As our population ages, we already know that by 2050 in this country 7Â½ thousand Australians each and every week will be diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer's. There is the cost of medical technology - and a country like ours wants to embrace robotic surgery and all of that, which needs to be embraced quickly in an advanced economy but which is very expensive. I want to make sure that we can pay for all of that. At the moment, we provide, for a population of 23 million, 263 million free services each year on Medicare.                 I am saying that we want to have a sustainable system. As Labor supported in the nineties and, indeed, have supported since the 1960s a co-payment in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, I want to make sure that those who have a capacity to pay can pay, but under this scheme we retain bulk-billing so that those who cannot afford $7 can be bulk-billed.                 Labor can pretend to the Australian public and, indeed, pretend to themselves that everything can be given away for free -                      but it cannot. When we came into government, we inherited this $667 billion of debt. We are paying $1 billion a month in interest alone and, if we do not make changes, within 10 years that interest bill grows to $3 billion. So we are saying, fairly, squarely and honestly in this debate, that, if we can ask for a modest contribution, we can make Medicare sustainable.                 We also put money into medical research - and we make no apology for that whatsoever. We are some of the best medical researchers in the world and we want to make sure that we can continue that work so that we can find the cures for tomorrow as well.

  Let me thank the honourable member for his question. Can I firstly go through the facts of the Rossi tender so we all understand within the parliament exactly what we are talking about. The Department of Defence released a tender in June last year for the supply of three types of footwear: a fireman's industrial boot, a fawn coloured industrial protective boot and a black coloured protective footwear. There was no mandated requirement for Australian content as it does not relate to the combat uniform. The tender was conducted as a routine procurement within the department and, therefore, there is no requirement to notify government of it.                 The previous industrial protective footwear requirement was established in July 2011 for two years with Lymington Pacific, who manufactured the boots in China. This tender replaces those boots that have been made in China for the last two to three years. Ten tenderers replied and there were 14 individual offers for the fawn coloured and the black coloured boot. Rossi Boots - the boots the member for Kennedy is displaying here - tendered for the fawn and black industrial footwear. They were not successful in tendering for the fawn industrial footwear, due to overall value for money considerations - in other words, they were considered too expensive. The successful bidder is a company called Amare Safety - a privately owned company located in Mulgrave, Victoria. The boots will be supplied by Steel Blue, who will manufacture the boots in Indonesia. For the last three years, those industrial boots have been manufactured in China on behalf of an Australian company; now, they will be manufactured in Indonesia by an Australian company. This tender was released by the previous government. It had no mandated Australian requirements, and the decision has been made by the department.

  I want to thank the member for Banks for his question. He is not only a member with a distinguished career in business but also a member who fought for a Georges River recovery plan. It is great, after having had 32 questions on the environment from this side, to reflect on the fact that we have not had one question on the environment from that side. There was nothing about the Georges River recovery plan, nothing about the Yarra recovery plan, nothing about the Swan River recovery plan, nothing about the Torrens River and there is still nothing about our dugong and turtle protection plan.                 I want to apologise to the House. Yesterday, I quoted from the member for Port Adelaide's community newsletter, and I omitted something. It is true that, almost a year ago, he said that the carbon tax had been terminated and it is true that he said it twice, but I neglected to mention that he also said that 'The decision to terminate the carbon tax will save an average family around $380 in 2014-15.'                      He was at Townsville. He was the third man at Townsville. There he was. He did not mention that not only were they keeping another version but also it went up every year between now and 2020 to $38. They recognised that if you abolished the carbon tax, prices would come down. Guess what? The same people doing the same modelling and coming to the same conclusions are the ones advising us. If you ask where our savings come from, the same people doing the same modelling are coming to the same conclusions.                 The difference, however, is that when we get rid of the carbon tax, it is gone forever. When they say they terminate the carbon tax, firstly it is still here, secondly they are trying to keep it and thirdly they want to bring it back. Their own modelling shows the price they want to bring back will be $38 in 2020 but - wait for this! - their own modelling also shows that it goes up each year every year forever. By 2050, it will be a $350 per tonne tax. This is from their own modelling produced by the same people advising us. If you want to understand the impact on the economy, it is not just the savings this year but the savings each year. When we come to the next election, the carbon tax will be gone but they will be wanting to bring it back. The tax will go up and up and up, and that will not stop unless this government removes it and this government stays in office.

  Clearly this government, in this budget, is providing substantial funding to increase expenditure on hospitals, and that will provide additional employment opportunities for nurses. Therefore, this is a budget that is very fair to nurses. It is very fair to the medical system and the provision of medical services.                     There is a nine per cent increase in expenditure for health in this budget. There is nine per cent in the following year. There is nine per cent the year after. That will provide substantial new employment opportunities for nurses.                     Let me make it absolutely clear -                      The question was about the cost of the degree and therefore the employment opportunities of nurses. So I am responding absolutely correctly. Under the new system, there will be better paid opportunities in the future that will allow people to repay their HECS debt.                     This will result in continuing the training and building of the workforce in the health sector. The reality is that this is a government that cares deeply about ensuring that the health system of our nation is sustainable. We know that we will need more nurses in the future to ensure that that health care can be provided, especially in an ageing society. That is why we are reforming the higher education system to enable more nurses to be trained, therefore enabling us to better meet our responsibilities for health care as a nation in the years ahead.

  It is a great question, and I think those opposite for their encouragement! The member for Boothby asked a very important question about this government's conviction to axe the carbon tax and to make sure that consumers and businesses receive the benefits of that action. That is a strategy that has been endorsed by the electorate. It is a central part of our economic action strategy. Despite this very clear and overwhelmingly endorsed strategy, we still see Labor standing in the way of the government implementing this mandate.                 I listened with interest to the member for McMahon - he was one of the Townsville trio - who was questioning whether there was some lack of commitment to seeing the cost savings passed through by the abolition of the carbon tax. That could not be further from the truth. We are adamant that those benefits will be passed through. The member for McMahon recognised at some point when he was Treasurer that the abolition of the carbon tax would reduce cost-of-living pressures. He seemed to recognise it in government but now in opposition, for pure opportunistic reasons, seems to reject that simple assertion. Just to remind him, there is this flyer sprinkled around letterboxes in the country -                      claiming that the abolition of the carbon tax will reduce cost-of-living pressure and deliver benefits for households. That is exactly why this government is adamant we have to get on with it.                 Instead of doing what they claimed they would and 'terminating the tax', which was Labor's line, they have actually voted three times in this place to escalate the tax and then extend it to heavy freight. That is their ambition. We are aiming to get rid of this carbon tax. We want to deliver those savings that Labor seemed to recognise in government but seem to have forgotten about now they are in opposition. It is $550 that the average household will benefit, lifting a multibillion-dollar impost on business that is good fit jobs, great for small business, terrific for viability of our enterprises, good for our competitiveness and great for our growth prospects.                 We have also seen some questioning about our belief that the savings must and will be passed on. You have heard the ACCC commissioner Rod Simms say that 'what went up will clearly come down when you take away the carbon tax'. For gas consumers in New South Wales, that is 9.2 per cent lower gas prices from the abolition of the carbon tax. We will see electricity savings in Tasmania, in Queensland and here in the ACT of 11.6 per cent. There is an obligation on the package of bills that have passed this place to see electricity, natural gas and synthetic greenhouse gas suppliers pass on those savings from the abolition of the carbon tax. The ACCC will enforce those reasonably expected price reductions. Customers will get an estimate of those savings from network electricity and gas retailers. We also have transparency in seeing a validation of those methodologies to calculate those savings. So not only have we argued the case; we have made and actioned our commitment to abolish the carbon tax and armed the ACCC. We are adamant those benefits will flow through to families, business and the Australian economy.

  This is a budget that is about fairness to all Australian people. It is about delivering better services. It is about reducing the cost of living by getting rid of a $550 penalty on Australian families under the carbon tax. We are getting rid of a cost that is an impost on the lives of every Australian. That is a cost that has to be borne day in and day out. What is more, under Labor, that cost would continue to go up every year. Their commitment to a carbon tax is that it will be bigger next year than it is this year.                 The coalition is committed to getting rid of the carbon tax. Labor wants to reintroduce it. What I can say to nurses and other Australians whose costs are going up under the carbon tax is that we will be taking away the impact of that cost and, into the future, every cost under us will be lower than it would be under Labor. Labor is committed to imposing the carbon tax again. The carbon tax adds to the cost of living. It is designed to do that.                     Labor wants to increase the cost of living. It wants to increase the burden on living costs for nurses and, indeed, all workers in the Australian workforce.                 Whatever the price of goods is now, it would be higher under Labor because Labor is committed to keeping a carbon tax which is affecting the cost of living of all Australians, including our nurses. If we want to have a government and a health system that is capable of delivering the services we need, we need to have the arrangements put in place to plan for the future, to ensure that we have a strong economy that is able to meet its commitments. Whatever the cost, it would be higher under Labor because Labor wants to have a carbon tax that goes up every year.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question. I was in Tasmania just the other day, and it is great to see Tasmania getting ahead under our government. It is great to see a government, our government, that is now getting 54 cents a litre for milk. It is great to see a government that is now putting money towards the Midlands, and they are making the choice there of whether they go out of sheep and into dairy.                     It is a hard choice to make, because under our government they a getting $100,000 for a B-double of sheep. That is because of the actions of our government. Under their government, if a sheep died I know you would throw it in the gully. With prices like those under our government you would have to give it a state funeral, I suppose!                 Under our government we have moved 16,000 litres a milk a week from the North Coast of New South Wales and it is getting between $9 and $12 a litre. Our government is supporting the $80 million development of what Devondale is doing to expand their plant in Tasmania. Under our government we are actually getting turnaround. We have three months to go and our figures for dairy production basically equal your figures for the whole year. Under out government we are actually getting things moving ahead. That is why under our government agriculture is up 19.3 per cent in value for the quarter compared with what it was. The problem is that if you get their government back -                    The member for Charlton then left the chamber.                     Then there is the sobering news after the terrible trio - Batman, who is no longer with us, Robin, who still resides with us, and the butler, Alfred Pennyworth - went to Townsville. They said they would get rid of the carbon tax, but, of course, they did not. That is why under their government there was a 400 per cent increase in the price of refrigerant gases, which the dairy industry uses. That is why under their government there was an increase in the power prices. We have the big dairy farmers paying between $10,000 and $15,000 in power prices, and, of course, those prices went up.                 Under their government they still believed in a 6.85 cents a litre increase in diesel prices, because they believe they can make the world cooler. Under their government they believe in making you poorer. Their policy is to make you poorer. They are to be remembered by making you poorer. Their No. 1 policy if you want them back is to make you poorer, because they believe that they can single-handedly cool the planet from a room in Canberra. They believe in this peculiar place where if you put Australian coal into Australian coal-fired power plants, it is a bad rock, but if it moves over water to another country and makes people in that country warmer or cooler -

  From our perspective, our priority for nurses is that they have the opportunity to get a job and keep a job.                     And also that they have the opportunity to earn a good income. Nurses work unbelievably hard. They make enormous sacrifices. They are the ultimate givers in so many ways.                     Nurses work incredibly hard in very difficult environments. It is a great saying that the most sacred thing a human being can give, after their love, is their labour. It is the case that nurses give both on so many occasions in their tending to the sick and dealing with the ill.                 From our perspective, a nurse is often a mother or a father, as well. As a parent they do not want to bequeath to their children a lesser quality of life than that which they have had. That is why we are setting about fixing the budget. We will not leave the next generation of Australians with a bigger debt and higher taxes and a lesser quality of life than that which we have.                   The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     It is not Joe Hockey saying it, or Tony Abbott, or Warren Truss, or any member of the coalition. It is the Secretary of the Treasurer. It is the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It is economists like John Edwards, who were advisers to Labor prime ministers. It is Angel Gurria, the head of the OECD.                     Everyone who has an ounce of credibility on economics recognises that if we do not address the budget crisis now the pain associated with fixing it in five, 10, 15 or 20 years is going to be far greater for Australians. That is why we are moving now. That is why we are undertaking reform now - because we must.                     The days of Labor using a credit card and paying off today's bills at the expense of the future simply leaves our children in a lesser position than that which we had. The coalition and everyday Australians will not cop leaving the next generation of Australians with a lesser quality of life.                 Do you know what the irony of it is? The Labor Party believed this before the last election. The Labor Party went out there and said they were going to deliver a surplus. They know in their hearts that you have to fix the budget. They know in their hearts that you have to run surpluses. The problem is that the Labor Party is full of hypocrites. When it comes to honesty, don't look at the Labor Party.

  I hear the interjections from the Labor Party about the nurses, but I do not remember them standing up for the health services workers when they were defending Craig Thomson in this House. I do not remember them caring very much about the nurses or the cleaners in the Health Services Union when they were being ripped off by Craig Thomson, the former member for Dobell.                      I take the interjection from the member for Rankin. It was a very foolish interjection on your part. I do thank the member for McPherson for her question about the carbon tax and the impact on schools.                     I would make the point that, with the abolition of the carbon tax, schools will save $85 million a year on expenses from the carbon tax. That is $340 million over four years. It is $340 million that they will not have to pay in taxes to Canberra. They will then get a choice. Many schools and, in many cases, education departments will decide that they can put that $340 million instead into sporting equipment, into IT upgrades, into new classrooms and, dare I say it, into school halls - things that students will be able to use every day in their school to improve the outcomes for their education. Labor would prefer that that $340 million sat in the coffers of the tax office in Canberra rather than circulate in the economy, being used by schools to improve educational outcomes.                  On this side of the House we know that, if we abolish the carbon tax, $340 million more will be used by schools for better student outcomes. Worse than that, if Labor is re-elected in 2016 they plan to bring the carbon tax back. They plan to reintroduce the carbon tax. So the choice is very clear. If you vote for the coalition there will be no carbon tax after 2016.                     If you vote for the Labor Party, the toxic, job-destroying, price-increasing carbon tax will be back. The choice is very clear. If you want lower electricity prices, lower electricity bills, you will need to vote coalition at the next election. If you want more expensive costs at the supermarket counter, you will need to vote Labor at the next election. Finally, if you want schools to pay the carbon tax after 2016, you will vote Labor. If you want schools not to pay the carbon tax, you will continue to keep the coalition in office.                  I would like to thank the Labor Party for making the next election about the carbon tax again. We won one election on it. We arguably have won two elections on it. I can tell you that if the Australian public find out that if they vote Labor the carbon tax is coming back, woe betide those members in marginal seats who think they are coasting to victory at the next election. They will get a very nasty surprise.

  Well, I take the question because when you compare last year's budget to this year's budget, I have only been asked 25 per cent of the questions that I asked of Wayne Swan last year, so I have to scratch for every question I can get from the member for McMahon.                     I say to the member for McMahon: we are not about watering down protections for consumers.                     I will tell you why - because the protections that the Labor Party put in place did not particularly work, as is self-evident at the moment. A whole lot of initiatives that Labor put in place, often at the request of the industry funds, actually did not deliver what they were hoping for. Why? Well, I was reflecting carefully on this. The minister that was responsible for the Future of Financial Advice measures was the Hon. Bill Shorten. When he came into the House and introduced the old FoFA legislation, which he said was going to offer protection for consumers, he was in such a muddle that he tabled 10 amendments to his own bill and then moved 16 further amendments.                  The outcome was that the laws that Labor set up to protect consumers were so muddled that the original explanatory memorandum to the bill had to be added to with a revised explanatory memorandum. Then they screwed that up and had to introduce a replacement explanatory memorandum. Then they screwed that up and had to introduce a supplementary revised explanatory memorandum. Then they screwed that up - hard to believe, but they did it. It was the Labor Party in government - bear with us. They screwed that up and had to introduce a further supplementary explanatory memorandum. That is the complete unmitigated mess of the previous government in relation to financial advice laws. No wonder financial advisers were confused. No wonder consumers were confused. The great architects of these reforms, the member for McMahon and the Leader of the Opposition, now want to properly run the country again. They did such a great job screwing up the country last time that they want to have a chance to do it again.                 Our reforms are sensible. Our reforms put in place rules to ensure that there is consistency and predictability in relation to financial advice. Our reforms were on the table for the Australian people before the last election. Our reforms deliver the sensible nature that we expect of financial laws.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I visited his electorate not too long ago. He has a great interest in health matters and trying to enhance health services locally. He has been, like most people from New South Wales, completely gobsmacked by the years of Labor as they mismanaged health in New South Wales and now in the last six months many of the same union hacks transferred from New South Wales into the federal parliament to mismanage the health system here. Not much changes under Labor; not much changes at all.                 I was reflecting the other night and I thought, 'What is my favourite documentary?' I think my favourite documentary was probably TheHollowmen. It was a documentary of the Rudd-Gillard years. It documented all of the great successes, such as the advisers coming in to then ministers, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, and advising them on particular matters like how they could come up with a big distraction. I thought, 'What would they have done in relation to the carbon tax? How would they have advised the member for Sydney, who was the world's worst ever health minister, on the impact of a carbon tax?'                 The carbon tax, of course, applies to hospitals just like it does to every process in the economy that involves energy. When you turn the lights on at home, the carbon tax hit you. When you drive down the road to pick up the kids after school, you are paying the carbon tax. When you go the supermarket, the carbon tax applies. Labor had never thought about this. They had never thought about what happens in hospitals, pharmacies or surgeries around the country and the inconvenience of having to run 24-hour ICU units. What happens there? The carbon tax applies. You can imagine the scene in TheHollowmen where they come in and say, 'Well, we could just turn the lights off in the hospital.' But somebody must realise that there are patients within hospitals and there are costs in running hospitals.                 If you are spending money on electricity and carbon taxes within hospitals and public hospital settings, you are not spending that money on health. This is a very important point. We have heard a lot today from the Labor Party about nurses. Do you know why that is? It is not because they have an interest in nurses; it is because the nurses union is in town. I will tell you one thing that happens when the union bosses are in town: these people dance to their tune. They dance to their tune at every opportunity. They dance to the tune of the nurses union at every opportunity because it is the nurses union, it is the HSU and it is the AMWU - it is all of the unions - that decide whether or not these people sit in parliament. That is why they are second-rate when they are in government and that is why we will continue to draw the distinction between the bad years of Labor - as it operates at a state level and as it has operated at a federal level - and the competence of this side of the House. We always are elected to clean up Labor messes. We are in the process of doing it now and we will do it for as long as it takes.

  This government wants the Australian people to have access to the highest quality financial advice available. We are determined to ensure that the regime that governs the industry is effective and will deliver the best possible service to the Australian people. The government is not watering down any consumer protection and it is not scrapping the best interest duty or reintroducing commissions. We have no plans to reintroduce commissions. This is a Labor Party scare campaign. Indeed, the government supported a ban on commissions and conflicted remuneration for financial advisers all along. At no point has the government sought to introduce commissions. The pretext behind the honourable member's question is completely false.                 If you want to have an 'independent' commentary on this matter, ABC's FactCheck - which is hardly noted for being friendly to this side of politics - described suggestions that we are bringing back commissions as 'scaremongering'. They also stated that the changes:                 _ do not bring back the type of commissions that financial advisers could receive before FOFA was introduced.                 The reality is that the basis of the honourable member's question is wrong and he should stop trying to scaremonger.                     No, I referred to some notes.                     Yes.

  I thank the member for Lyons. He is known as Mr Tourism in Tasmania for his very passionate promotion of Freycinet Peninsula and Cradle Mountain. He is also doing a great job as deputy chair of our tourism committee. The carbon tax has become a $115 million a year leg-rope on our great tourism industry, an industry that is one of our great strengths. The fact is that many of the 512,000 jobs that were lost in small business over the six years of Labor administration were in the tourism industry. They stand culpable because this was a time of great growth in the tourism industry in the region. Many jobs were trashed unnecessarily in the tourism industry.                 Look at what else happened in the region. Under Labor, between 2007 and 2013, international visitors increased by 16 per cent. Now, you will take credit for that, but the fact of the matter is that for Singapore, geographically one of our great competitors, they went up 51 per cent. This was at a time when the middle class had been growing exponentially in the region and tourism had been growing - and we lost out. In fact, we lost jobs in the tourism sector. Labor's carbon tax and tourism taxes such as the 45 per cent increase in passenger movement charges, increased tourism visa charges of over 50 per cent and reduced funding for Tourism Australia all combined to give us that pathetic result and to see the job losses in our region.                 The carbon tax caused all this damage because it is a tax that our international competitors do not have to pay. This is what they do not understand on the other side. It pushed up the price of local holidays relative to all of our competitors. It is a simple proposition. Think about it. It is why you should be supporting the removal of the carbon tax. As the middle class in the region grows from 600 million to three billion over the next 20 to 30 years, we need to get our tourism businesses in the best possible competitive position. Scrapping the carbon tax is a very big contribution: $115 million a year taken off the competitive disadvantage imposed by those opposite. If the Labor Party were serious they would get rid of this tax.

  If the honourable member wants to quote people, let me quote a few people. John Brogden, CEO of the Financial Services Council, said:                 These changes do not change the substance or the intent of FoFA. The fundamental reforms and increased professionalism of financial advisers remain. However, these small changes ensure FoFA works as it was intended - to improve the quality and quantity of financial advice.                 This is the industry organisation, the Financial Services Council, being supportive of these sorts of initiatives. Stephen Munchenberg of the Australian Bankers' Association said these amendments are 'sensible' and claimed opponents had been circulating disinformation about their impact.                  I think the shadow Treasurer should be honest with the Australian people. We have no plans to water down the quality of financial advice. We intend to get rid of some of the red tape so that the industry operates more efficiently and more smoothly, but the reality is that under this government there will be reputable financial advice available to those who need it and hopefully in a more accessible form.

  It is good to see the Leader of the Opposition back. Bill, there's been quite an audition going on while you've been away!                     I thank the member for Ryan for her question. As she knows, at the last election we took a promise to the young people of Australian universities, the undergraduates, that we would implement a scholarship program to give them an opportunity to live and study and work in countries in our region. This was a practical way of finding expression for the Abbott government's foreign policy of deeper engagement in our region. I can confirm to the member that we have successfully implemented a pilot program and that 1,340 undergraduates - young Australians between the ages of 18 and 28 - have now been awarded grants and scholarships to study at four locations in the region: Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Japan.                 Recently, in the presence of the Governor-General, who is patron of the new Colombo Plan, we awarded 40 scholarships that are longer term - six-month or 12-month scholarships - for young Australians to live, study and work at universities in the region. The member for Ryan will be pleased to know that four students from the University of Queensland were awarded scholarships. The member for Kingsford Smith was there on behalf of the opposition. Five students from the University of New South Wales were awarded scholarships. The member for Fraser would be pleased that the Yudhoyono Fellow, young student Emma Roberts, from ANU, has been awarded a scholarship. She speaks perfect Bahasa; she spoke to the audience that evening. She will make a fine ambassador for Australia in Indonesia.                 Thirty-eight universities have now taken part in the New Colombo Plan and it has been warmly received not only by businesses and the university sector but by leaders in our region. I was personally delighted when Japanese Prime Minister Abe mentioned the New Colombo Plan as an evidence of our growing people-to-people links when he made his address to the joint sitting here last week.                 In 2015 this program will be rolled out across the region. China, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Philippines and other countries are coming on board. It has been embraced by the university sector. Universities Australia, the peak body, said:                 Our universities have been delighted to get behind this unique program because of the exciting opportunity it represents, not just for their brightest students but for those who embody the spirit of the Plan in celebrating Australia's commitment to the region _                 The program has the potential to transform, not just the educational experience and global outlook of our students, but for Australian-Indonesia-Pacific relations _                 And in a mark of what I think is the coalition government's soft-power diplomacy, Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa has offered to take Australian New Colombo Plan scholars in the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

  We must deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. It is as simple as that. We must deal with Labor's debt and deficit disaster. When members opposite were in government they gave us the six biggest deficits in Australia's history. They gave us debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see - $123 billion in prospective deficits over four years, debt peaking at $667 billion.                     As a result of this budget we get back to balance within four years and we reduce Labor's peak debt by almost $300 billion.                     Members opposite could come up with an alternative, but of course they do not. The problem with members opposite -                      is that they were incompetent in government and irresponsible in opposition. The one thing about this Labor Party is that they were wreckers in government and now they are trying to wreck government, and this is why it is so important that the budget be supported.

  Well, it is indeed the world's biggest carbon tax -                      but it is loved by members opposite.                     But it is rightly opposed by the member for Wannon. It is a very important question from the member for Wannon, because the Portland aluminium smelter is in his electorate. The whole point of the carbon tax is to reduce Australia's aluminium production by 61 per cent.                   The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     It is in the Labor Party's own figures that they published in government. Aluminium production in this country comes down by 60 per cent.                     Scrapping the carbon tax will give the aluminium industry a fighting chance. It will give the iron and steel industry a fighting chance of survival in this country, and that is what we want to do. We want to give the decent workers and the honest businesses of this country the best possible chance to flourish, and that is exactly what scrapping the carbon tax does. Scrapping the carbon tax removes a nine per cent impost on power prices. It removes a $9 billion a year handbrake on our economy. Scrapping the carbon tax removes -                      a $550 a year hit on the budget of the average Australian family. The member for Wannon asked about the cost of living. The best thing you can do to improve Australians' cost of living is to scrap the carbon tax and to scrap it now, because that will save the average household $550 a year.                     Scrapping the carbon tax will reduce prices. As the Chairman of the ACCC has said, 'What went up will come down when you take away the carbon tax.' Let me repeat that. The Chairman of the ACCC said, 'What went up will come down when you take away the carbon tax.' The Energy Supply Association of Australia said, 'Savings from the removal of the carbon tax will be fully passed through to gas and electricity consumers once the Australian parliament repeals the legislation.' So that is our challenge - to repeal this legislation, to get prices down, to save Australian families $550 a year on average.                  But there is a very clear difference in this parliament. The government wants to save the households of Australia $550 a year. The Labor Party wants to add $550 a year to their costs. Even if the carbon tax goes in this parliament, elect that mob and it comes straight back in, because Labor loves taxes.

  Yet again, the premise of the Leader of the Opposition's question is simply false. No Labor budget provided the $80 billion for schools and hospitals that the Leader of the Opposition now claims.                     There were pie-in-the-sky promises, absolutely undeliverable pie-in-the-sky promises from the members opposite, but the $80 billion that the Leader of the Opposition refers to never appeared in any Labor budget. How can you cut something that never existed? Let me make it absolutely crystal clear: public hospital funding goes up nine per cent this year, nine per cent next year, nine per cent the year after that and six per cent in the final year of the budget. Schools funding goes up eight per cent this year, eight per cent next year, eight per cent the year after that and six per cent in the final year of the budget. We are increasing funding on schools and hospitals. The difference between the government and the opposition is that under this government spending is sustainable. Under the members opposite, spending was completely out of control. That is why we have the debt and deficit disaster that this government is now fixing.

  I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her question. On each occasion the member for Macquarie has gone to the polls she has promised the Australian people that we would get on with the job of fixing the budget, and we are. We are getting on with the job of fixing the mess that was left to us by the Australian Labor Party - $123 billion of deficits and $667 billion of debt. The thing is that once upon a time the Labor Party believed in that as well. The Labor Party once believed that we had to ensure that the budget gets back to surplus. At this very dispatch box in 2012 the member for Lilley, who is obviously in a witness protection program this week, said:                 We will be back in the black by 2012-13, on time, as promised.                 He went on to say:                 The alternative  -  meandering back to surplus  -  would compound the pressures in our economy and push up the cost of living for pensioners and working people.                 Under Labor they did not meander back to surplus, they went AWOL. They absolutely disappeared when it came to a surplus. They promised a surplus and then claimed they were delivering a surplus, but they went missing. They never delivered a surplus. Now is the time to fix the budget. It must be done now. If we want jobs, if we want prosperity, if we want to be competitive in the days, months and years ahead, now is the time to start fixing the budget. We must do so. And there are a hell of a lot of early warning devices out there - the governor of the Reserve Bank said, 'Now is the time to fix the budget.' The Secretary of the Treasury said, 'Now is the time to fix the budget.' Even Dr John Edwards, a former advisor to Paul Keating, said, 'Now is the time to fix the budget.' After our government was elected, Paul Keating said, 'Now is the time to fix the budget.' Bob Hawke said, 'Now is the time to fix the budget.' The Labor Party used to say, 'Now is the time to fix the budget.' But they are now opposing everything we are doing. The weird thing is that they are opposing everything that they were going to do.                     That is why we have introduced the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill. We are asking the Labor Party not just to support our promises to fix the budget; we are also asking them to support their own promises to fix the budget. All we are doing is asking them to keep their promises. All we are asking them to do is to stay true to their own budget of last year. If we all work together we can ensure there are more jobs for Australians and a more prosperous economy.

  The government does believe there should be a modest co-payment on visits to GPs. That has been absolutely crystal clear for some time now. Former Prime Minister Hawke was the father of the Medicare co-payment; the member for Jagajaga was the mother of the Medicare co-payment; the member for Fraser is the son of the Medicare co-payment.                     If I have transgressed, then I withdraw and I apologise. But the only political party that has actually introduced a co-payment in this country is, in fact, the Labor Party. They introduced a co-payment because they wanted to make Medicare sustainable. That is why they introduced a co-payment; that is why the Labor's Assistant Treasurer says, 'But there is a better way of operating a health system.' Let me repeat that:                  But there is a better way of operating a health system and the change should hardly hurt at all. _ the ideal model involves a small co-payment - not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc.                  This hardly radical idea - this idea which is enshrined in precedent from the Hawke Labor government - is something that this government does support. I say to members opposite: if it is right and proper to have a modest co-payment on the PBS, how can it be wrong and improper to have a modest co-payment on Medicare? I say again: this government is determined to put the budget on a sound footing; this government is determined to put the economy on a sound footing; and, yes, this government is determined to put Medicare on a sound footing. And we will.

  I thank the honourable member for the question. There are many changes we would like to make to the taxation system, and there is one before the Senate at the very moment - and that is to get rid of the carbon tax. There is another tax that we want to abolish - the mining tax. We want to simplify the taxation system, and that is why prior to the last election we undertook to provide a taxation white paper and to take the recommendations of the taxation white paper to the Australian people at the next election. The fundamental point is that if you are to undertake the sorts of reforms that the honourable member believes to be worthy, such as abolishing provisional tax, you need to have money in the bank. You need to have the financial capacity to deliver that sort of reform. When you are running significant deficits, you cannot do anything to undermine your revenue base.                 This is why we need to pull back on the wasteful expenditure that was the legacy of the last Labor government. That is why we cannot proceed with taxes like the mining tax, which has raised three per cent of the revenue Labor claimed, but still proceeds, sir, with all the expenditure against the tax that has raised no money. That leaves the budget worse off - not just today, not just tomorrow, but well into the future. If you are going to undertake significant tax reform, you can best do it when you are not relying on a clutch of new taxes to increase the revenue base, but rather you can look to compensate people for the transition to a new revenue system that does simplify the taxation system overall and makes us a more competitive nation. But I would say through you, Madam Speaker, to the member for Fairfax and all members of this parliament: we need to be in a position where we can simplify the taxation system, deliver fairer and simpler taxes and deliver reduced taxes - which is exactly what the coalition promised in the budget and which it will do through its taxation reform paper. At the end of the day, you are absolutely right - the low-tax parties are the coalition parties. The high-tax party is the Labor Party, and that is why I expect the support of Palmer United in getting rid of the carbon tax package and getting rid of the mining tax package.

  I thank the honourable member for Bonner for his question. All members of the coalition, and I believe the member for Fairfax, want to get rid of the carbon tax. Today is rather auspicious; it is a significant day; today is the first anniversary of the Townsville termination by the terrible trio. The terrible trio - the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the member for McMahon and the butler - stood at Townsville and said, 'We are terminating the carbon tax.' Old Alfred the butler was there saying, 'Go on, Batman, go ahead and do it! Terminate it, Batman.' And they did.                  They said they were terminating the carbon tax one year ago today. It is the first anniversary. I expect there will be a little cake going over to the Leader of the Opposition with one little candle lit on it. He will blow it out all by himself. He will say: 'Don't worry, we have terminated the carbon tax.' But they have not. They are now the strongest advocates for the carbon tax. They are chasing the Greens around the table, saying, 'No, no, we are in favour of the carbon tax. No, we're in favour of the carbon tax.' They are defending the carbon tax because it is their creation. Despite telling the Australian people that they were going to get rid of it, they actually want to keep it. They have not just declared they want to keep it; they have voted three times in the parliament to keep the carbon tax.                 We believe in a stronger economy. We believe in more jobs. We believe in Australia being more competitive when it comes to dealing, trading, with the rest of the world. We also believe that, when you have smaller government, you have a larger country. When you have smaller government, you have a bigger country and a bigger economy. The way to do that on this occasion is to get rid of the carbon tax. That is exactly what we are doing. Of course, there are some people in the Labor Party who still believe that you should get rid of the carbon tax. It was not so long ago that the member for McMahon said, 'The reason you get rid of the carbon tax is to provide real costs of living relief to families.' That is why he went to Townsville to terminate the carbon tax a year ago: because, in the words of the member for McMahon, the best way to help families with relief from the cost-of-living pressures is to terminate the carbon tax. Well, I say to the Labor Party: only we are prepared to terminate the carbon tax. Only we are prepared to do the things that give cost relief to everyday Australian families, and it is now time for the Labor Party to be honest with itself and honest with the Australian people.

  I can guarantee to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this government will tackle Labor's debt and deficit disaster. We were left with a legacy of debt projected to reach $667 billion on top of the six biggest deficits in our history from six Labor budgets.                     We were left with a legacy of four further deficits, totalling $123 billion.                     The difficulty that this government is wrestling with is that we inherited the worst fiscal legacy in our history, thanks to members opposite, thanks to the government in which the Leader of the Opposition was  a very senior member. He was the king maker and king breaker, the queen maker and queen breaker, in the former government. Thanks to the work of that government, we were headed for 10 consecutive budget deficits. And never before in Australia's history have there been 10 consecutive budget deficits. Even recovering from the depths of the 1990-91 recession -                      we had only seven consecutive budget deficits. So, members opposite, when they were in government, gave us the six worst budget deficits in history and projected another four budget deficits - debt and deficit stretching out as far as the eye can see. And they did this to us at a time of continued economic growth, with the biggest terms of trade in our history. That is a sign of the irresponsibility of members opposite when it comes to money and fiscal policy. They gave us the worst fiscal position in our history at a time of the best terms of trade in our history. So, there is a very clear lesson here: you just cannot trust the Labor Party with the economy of our country.

  I am delighted to take this question from the member for Forde - not just because he campaigned for lower electricity prices at the last election and not just because he and his wife, Judi, have been tremendously successful small business people but, in particular, because the member for Forde was the man who beat Peter Beattie! However, that is probably the reason we have him - the one sitting over there - as the Leader of the Opposition.                 But the question asked was, who is standing in the way of removing the carbon tax and lowering electricity prices? And, lo and behold, it is the same Leader of the Opposition. Right at this moment his senators are on strike. They are doing what he knows best; he has called them out on strike. There is a picket of the Senate voting box. We are going through this agonising process of speech after speech, repetition after repetition, of senators from the ALP, under instructions from the Leader of the Opposition, not to allow the carbon tax to be repealed.                     We will be keep going. Let me say this to the Leader of the Opposition: we will keep going, for as long as it takes this parliament, until the carbon tax is repealed. His senators are doing everything they can to avoid a vote, to avoid the decision, to avoid the pledge that, as the Treasurer says, was made exactly a year ago today. But in the meantime it is costing Australian businesses real money.                 The case of Teys was raised by the member for Forde. Teys is one of Australia's most successful and largest meat processors. It has a carbon tax bill of approximately $5 million a year in direct costs, in electricity costs, in gas costs, in water costs and in refrigerant costs. That can all end today. It can end immediately. For it to end, however, the Leader of the Opposition has to call his senators back to work, allow them to vote and allow them to make the decision the Australian people expect - and allow them to make the decision they campaigned for at the last election.                  We have done a little bit more research and, lo and behold, we found a fact sheet put out by the member for McMahon a year ago today. What does that fact sheet show? For a small business, it shows a $9,000 saving. If they use 500 megawatts of electricity each year, they could save $9,000 a year. For synthetic greenhouse gases and refrigerants, there would be a 75 per cent reduction in costs - real savings. The only people standing -

  The once proud Labor Party is reduced to this pathetic spectacle of scare after scare after scare. Really and truly, it is pathetic to see the party of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating reduced to this - a party which was, along with John Howard and Peter Costello, very significantly responsible for building the prosperity of this country.                   The member for Perth then left the chamber.                     After 25 years of economic reform, after 25 years of good government, we then had six years from members opposite. They were wreckers in government and now they want to wreck government. That is what we get from the Labor Party. On the question raised by the member for Scullin: every year, under this coalition, pensions will go up. Every six months, every year, pensions will go up. They will go up this March. They will go up this September. They will go up next March and they will go up next September. They will go up the March after that and they will go up the September after that.                     The shadow minister opposite says that they will not go up as much. What is he saying they will not go up as much for when the member for Scullin was asking about cuts to the pension? They are just telling lies - and they cannot decide which lie they are telling us today.                     That particular recommendation was ruled out the day the report was released.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. For cities like Darwin, which is in her electorate, transport costs are very substantial. It adds to their cost of living and of course makes it difficult for products from the Northern Territory to get to other parts of the country. A year ago, Labor announced their Townsville termination. Only a few days later members opposite were circulating newsletters to their electorates promising that, under Labor, there would be no carbon tax - faithfully promising there would be no carbon tax. They have now had three opportunities in this place to deliver on that promise and they have welshed. They have walked away. Labor wants to keep the carbon tax.                 We know they have form in this regard. It is not the first time they have promised to get rid of a carbon tax. In 2010, there was going to be no carbon tax under the government that the then Prime Minister led. In 2013, there was the Townsville termination. If, at the next election in 2016, they perchance talk about there being no carbon tax under Labor, they have form. Everyone knows that if Labor is returned to office the world's biggest carbon tax will be back - except it will be bigger and more comprehensive, because Labor has promised to extend the carbon tax to transport fuel. If they were in office today, that would already be in place. Labor would be imposing a transport fuel carbon tax. That would have a particular impact on the Northern Territory because of the very large distances that are involved in doing business in the Territory.                  The Australian Trucking Association has estimated that the carbon tax on the trucking sector would have cost $510 million in 2014-15 alone - and their estimates were higher and higher for each year after that. Labor intends to put up this cost. The biggest carbon tax in the world will get even bigger. We also know that the carbon tax has imposed costs on other parts of the transport sector. For example, the impact of the carbon tax on Australian airlines has been of the order of $200 million in the first year - and again it gets higher and higher every year.                  Labor promised in 2010 that there would be no carbon tax. In 2013, they again promised that there would be no carbon tax. In 2016, they will probably promise it again, but it will be just as untruthful and Australians will be burdened by the world's biggest tax - except it will be even bigger and even nastier to Australian consumers.

  It is a big week for the member for Corio: two questions in two days. It took him 200 days to get here, but I welcome him back to the parliament. It is nice to see you here.                  On this matter, as the member opposite would know, the Australian Navy, with the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, forms part of Border Protection Command. The comments I made yesterday were of a general nature and relating to the performance of those men and women who serve in the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Royal Australian Navy. Members opposite should be aware of those things. I am not surprised that the member for Corio needs to come up to speed on this.                  I can assure the member of this: any person who is in the care and protection of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service will be in good care, and they are in good care, because I have great faith in the men and women of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service as I have great faith in the men and women of the Australian Navy -                      I am answering your question.                     I again refer the member to my earlier comments on this matter. In this very answer I have outlined the role of the Australian Navy and Customs and Border Protection Service and how they are involved in Border Protection Command. I have no intention in this place of going beyond the statements that have been made to the court - and these matters are before the court. I will not be doing that. I am surprised that those opposite would be puzzled or would need affirmation that any person who was in the care of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service would not be well dealt with.                     No, I am not surprised, because in the other place one of the Labor senators, Senator Conroy, felt fit to attack Lieutenant General Angus Campbell. They felt fit to try and give oxygen to the most outrageous claims I can recall that were levelled against the Australian Navy in the burnt hands fiasco, which they were embarrassed to have to walk away from as they stood aside those allegations. Here is last year's failure!                     I am not surprised the Manager of Opposition Business would be sensitively coming to the despatch box. I remind the House that last July, when he was minister, 4,338 people turned up on 48 illegal boats on his watch. It was the worst record of any immigration minister on our borders in our history. That is your record. The record of the member for McMahon, who sits opposite, is almost 25,000 arrivals on his watch. What a failure! What a hopeless failure! Here he comes again, last year's failure.                     The record of those opposite, when it comes to border protection, shows they are a field of dandelions -                      so easily blown away by the slightest breeze. They are a swarm of jellyfish. You would not be able to find a backbone amongst any of them, whether it is the member for McMahon, the member for Watson, the member for Gorton or the member for Corio. What a bunch of jellyfish you are!

  I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He asks me about the effect of the abolition of the carbon tax on jobs growth. I can tell him that when the carbon tax is abolished - we hope that will be today or, at the latest, tomorrow - it will remove a $7 billion a year handbrake on the Australian economy, a handbrake that Labor wants to keep on the Australian economy. I can tell the member for Hebert that it is estimated that by 2050 the abolition of the carbon tax will lead to the cumulative economic output of the country increasing by $1.3 trillion. If the carbon tax remains, that cumulative impact will not occur. That is what Labor wants to happen. They want to keep that handbrake on the Australian economy.                 With economic growth comes jobs growth. Without economic growth, it is not possible for the jobs market to grow. On this side of the House, the coalition recognises that if we want the economy to grow, if we want Australian families to have jobs, and to have better and better jobs into the future, we must abolish the carbon tax. I am pleased the Palmer United Party and other crossbenchers see it that way too. Without a carbon tax, real wages are estimated to increase by 2020 by 0.7 per cent. That is 0.7 per cent that households will gain in extra spending so that they can decide the priorities for their spending, rather than Labor and the Greens deciding the priorities for Australian families. On this side of the House, we want to expand freedom. We want to give families more opportunities to make their own decisions. On the other side of the House, they think big government knows best. They think individuals and Australians do not know best.                  If Labor is re-elected at the next election, as sure as night follows day, as sure as God made little green apples and as sure as I am standing here, Labor will reintroduce the carbon tax. At the next election in 2016, it will be another referendum for the Australian people on the carbon tax. What Labor has done is ensure that at the next election the coalition will be explaining to the Australian people that, if you vote Liberal or National, there will not be a carbon tax reintroduced. If you vote Labor at the next election, Labor will reintroduce the carbon tax, and that handbrake on the economy will be back, that reduction of real wages will be back, the job losses that have come since the carbon tax was introduced, like at Penrice Soda in my great state of South Australia from that job-destroying carbon tax, will be back. So, at the next election, Australians can decide: do they want the job-destroying carbon tax, or do they want the freedom, the extra finances and the support the economy gets by the abolition of the carbon tax?

  I have no doubt that there are some doctors who do not like the GP co-payment, just as there are some pharmacists who I am sure do not like the PBS co-payment that members opposite support. I accept that there are some doctors who do not support the position that the government has; on the other hand, there are many doctors who do support the position that the government has. In fact, the AMA's position is that it is not against a co-payment in principle. The position of the Australian Medical Association is that it is not against a co-payment in principle. We are happy to keep talking with the AMA about how this modest co-payment is best introduced. We do support a modest co-payment, like Bob Hawke, like the member for Fraser and not too much like but a little like, perhaps, the member for Jagajaga. We think that a co-payment does make sense, and it is very important to keep Medicare sustainable.

  I thank the member for Longman for his question and recognise that he keeps in close contact with both the childcare providers and the parents in his electorate. He knows the strains that they are facing in providing a high quality childcare product for families under the cost increases that were left to them by the Labor government. Let's not forget that under the previous minister, the member for Adelaide, fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent. The member for Adelaide at one stage said that fees would go up by 57c a week and then amended that to $8 a week. But, in fact, the 53 per cent under Labor's six years in government is a shocking legacy to have left people with. Labor's own regulatory authority said that a 75-place centre would face increases of $140,000 a year, just in the admin costs alone.                  As if the red tape were not bad enough, we have the carbon tax on top of that. One childcare provider in Queensland told me recently it would add about $1,000 a centre. That is not an inconsiderable amount. Centres are paralysed by the red tape that they are operating under. Many of them are small businesses and many of them know the difficulties of managing their balance sheets when they have this impost on top of everything else. Who can forget Earth Hour, when one of Labor's regulatory authorities marked a centre down for turning out the lights! They get hit when they turn the lights off, and they get hit when they turn the lights on because of the carbon tax impost on their electricity bill. We understand that children need to be in air conditioned comfort - we recognise that. Whether you are in the member for Longman's electorate in Queensland where the temperature is 35 degrees, or you are in Tasmania where it is minus 3Â½ degrees, cooling and heating adds considerably to the cost of providing high quality child care for the nation's children.                 Labor is no longer in government but parents and childcare centres are still paying the price for the carbon tax. Let us come back to the small family businesses that we are talking about. Labor does not care about balance sheets. Remember that the balance sheet when they came into government showed $45 billion in net assets; when they left government there was $162 billion of net debt - a $206 billion deterioration in the nation's balance sheet over six years in government. They do not care about the balance sheets of Australian families or the difficulties that centres are operating under or the pressures that everybody faces. It is time to scrap the carbon tax, stop this silly filibuster in the Senate and remember, front and centre, that we in the government have families and small businesses at the heart of what we do.

  As the shadow minister well knows, there is no compulsion on any doctor to charge the co-payment.                     The issue of nursing homes is one that the government is continuing to discuss with the Australian Medical Association, as you would expect. I do make this fundamental point: Bob Hawke introduced a co-payment, Labor's shadow Treasurer supports a co-payment and the member for Jagajaga kind of half supported a co-payment. We think that a modest co-payment makes as much sense for Medicare as it does for the PBS, and that is why this government supports it.                     I have.

  I thank the member for Petriefor his question. I can confirm for the member for Petrie, and for all honourable members in this place, that, yes, the energy supplement will be kept. It will be retained. Indeed, all current recipients of the energy supplement will continue to be paid that supplement. That is up to $361 for single pensioners per year and, for pensioner couples, up to $546 per year. This was a commitment that the coalition took to the last election to assist with cost-of-living pressures for Australians. All income support recipients - pensioners, both age pensioners and disability pensioners, and recipients of family tax benefits - will keep the energy supplement.                    This means that some 17,000 pensioners in the electorate of the member for Petrie will continue to receive the energy supplement. Not only will they receive the energy supplement but also they will have a twice-yearly increase in their pension and they will continue to receive the pension supplement. The 17,000 pensioners living in Redcliffe or Clontarf or surrounding areas such as Griffin in the electorate of the member for Petrie will continue to receive the energy supplement. It is not only the 17,000 pensioners in the honourable member's electorate who will benefit - some 12,500 recipients of family tax benefit part A will also continue to receive the energy supplement. And it is not just in the member for Petrie's electorate - it is in the electorates of every member in this place. Right around Australia millions of people will continue to receive the energy supplement; indeed, anybody currently receiving it will continue to receive it in the future.                 The honourable member for Petrie also asked me about the coalition's commitment to scrap the carbon tax. Of course we are committed to scrapping the carbon tax because scrapping the carbon tax means a reduction, on average, of $550 for households around Australia on top of the energy supplement, which will continue to be paid to current recipients. The Labor Party said they were going to scrap the carbon tax but they are filibustering in the Senate to avoid scrapping the carbon tax. We on this side of the House believe that we should do what we said and scrap the carbon tax. Why doesn't the Labor Party get on board and do likewise?

  Madam Speaker, I say to the lady in question: first of all, we are not watering down protections and, second, these problems took place when the former government was in office.                     These problems took place under the protections put in place by the former government -                      I fear that the shadow Treasurer is not wishing to protect the lady in question; he is just wishing to score cheap political points, Madam Speaker.                     Madam Speaker, none of us want to see vulnerable -                      Madam Speaker, none of us want to see vulnerable people ripped off by unscrupulous advisers. None of us want to see that. Every single member of this parliament wants to see a good and effective system of regulation in place; we all want to see an effective system of safeguards in place. It is a question of getting the balance right. And I say, of the changes that the government has put in place, that they do not withdraw the best interests tests, they do not introduce commissions, but they seek to ensure that people of modest incomes have access to the best professional advice - that is what they seek to do. And I am confident that the kinds of activities that the shadow minister referred to will be just as much prescribed by the system that we have put in as they were under the system put in by members opposite.

He is out there, amongst the 12,000 small businesses that he has in his electorate and amongst the workers that he represents in that electorate. And I know that he feels for small business because, unlike those people over there on that side, his family actually run a small business. They know what a business is all about. Of course, that small business is suffering under the weight of the carbon tax, and while those over on that side want to see the average worker in Australia pay a tax on their cold beer, the member for Reid is actually working with this government to make sure that that tax is removed. He knows that small business and businesses in general are the ones who create the jobs for Australians - the ones who get behind the young people of Australia who want to get an apprenticeship, get a skill, get a trade and go out there and contribute to the economy.                 This week we have delivered on our promise to help apprentices with their cost-of-living pressures. Can I thank member for Cunningham who - unlike many opposite - has actually demonstrated that where there is good policy, even where it needs a tweak - and she was very consultative in providing that tweak, she and those in the other house will support good policy. And this is good policy: providing apprentices in training with an $8,000-loan, then a further $6,000, a further $4,000 and a further $2,000 - interest-free. We are giving people the assistance they need to ensure that they are able to complete their training. We are also giving them an understanding of the responsibility of money, but we are saying this is the most generous way to assist young people in particular but all apprentices and those on the National Skills Needs List in getting their skills.                 This is a policy that will deliver outcomes, unlike the previous policy from the Labor Party, which saw the Tools For Your Trade money sprayed out across the community, whether an apprentice needed it or not. This is a well-targeted scheme that will make sure that apprentices have the ability to finish their skills and contribute to the community. This is our government getting on with the job, and this is a policy that will deliver for apprentices.

  All of the assertions contained in the Leader of the Opposition's question are false. We are not cutting schools and hospitals. We are not ripping off families. We are not imposing taxes in the way that the Leader of the Opposition suggests. We are addressing the debt and deficit disaster that we inherited from members opposite. Members opposite are in denial about the fiscal catastrophe that they created. They are absolutely in denial about the disaster that they left as their legacy. They accepted, in government, that they needed to move back to surplus. Why can't they accept now that it is necessary to move back to surplus?                     There were the tax cuts that they abandoned in government and now are voting in favour of. There were the spending cuts that they proposed in government and now are opposing. There was the carbon tax that they said they had terminated in government and are now supporting. They just do not know -                      where they stand. They do not know what they believe in.                     The embarrassment for members opposite is that they are the heirs and successors of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating - two prime ministers that members on this side often disagreed with but could always respect. We might have disagreed with much of what they said, but we could always respect what they did, because, whatever else they were, they were not wreckers. That is the problem with members opposite. The current crop of Labor members in parliament were wreckers in government and now just want to wreck government. That is the problem. This government has been given by the people of Australia a heavy responsibility.                     We were elected to fix the mess that Labor created. That is what we were elected to do. No-one ever said that it would be easy. In fact, fixing Labor's debt and deficit disaster is obviously going to be difficult, but this government is up to the task, and we will not let the people of Australia down. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  I do thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it gives me an opportunity to say that I am proud of this Treasurer. The government is proud of this Treasurer and, frankly, the country should be pleased and grateful that at last we have a Treasurer who is serious about delivering a debt and deficit repair job that so completely eluded members opposite when they were in government.                  No-one said that it would be easy to cure the debt and deficit disaster that this government has inherited. No-one said it was going to be easy to deal with the decade of debt and deficit that members opposite gave to this country, but I am proud and honoured to have as my colleague the member for North Sydney, the Treasurer of Australia, who has done so much already to restore this country to economic health. What the Australian people understand is that governments, like families and like businesses, cannot continue to live beyond their means. The Australian people understand that members opposite ran up the six biggest deficits in our history when they were in government. They left this government a legacy of $123 billion in prospective deficits. They gave every Australian man, woman and child a prospective debt of $25,000. That is what the people of Australia understand. They know that the rescue package is being put into place by this government, by this Prime Minister and, above all else, by this Treasurer. Thank you, Joe Hockey.

  I thank the member for Bennelong for his question. As everyone in this House should know, this government went to the election promising to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia, and at the very heart of our plan for a strong and prosperous economy is scrapping the carbon tax. The carbon tax is gone. This destructive, useless tax that damaged businesses, that damaged jobs and that damaged families' cost of living and this useless destructive tax that did not actually help the environment is finally gone. Four years after the former Prime Minister said that there would be 'no carbon tax under the government I lead', 3Â½ years after the former Prime Minister gave us this toxic tax -                      the carbon tax is finally gone. And with the carbon tax has gone a nine per cent impost on power prices, a $9 billion-a-year handbrake on our economy and a $550-a-year on the average household's cost of living. This has gone, thanks to this government. And I want to thank the Minister for the Environment and the Leader of the Government in the Senate for the work they did to bring about this good day for Australian families and this good day for Australian workers and businesses.                   The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     The carbon tax is gone, but it is not forgotten. The carbon tax is unloved by the Australian people, but it is still loved by members opposite, still loved by the Leader of the Opposition -                      who just this morning was saying on national radio, 'There will be a carbon tax under a government I lead if I ever get a chance.' The only way to keep the carbon tax out is to keep Labor out, because Labor is in love with tax. Labor is particularly in love with the carbon tax. Before the election this government made a series of commitments to the Australian people: we would scrap the carbon tax, we would build the roads of the 21st century -                      we would get the budget back under control and we would stop the boats. And every day this government is working calmly, purposefully and methodically -                      to honour our commitments to the Australian people.

  I really appreciate that question. I do so because obviously it is starting to dawn on the Labor Party that they have to have an alternative to their approach. And the alternative is the embarrassment associated with them voting against their own savings from their last budget. Labor cannot even keep their promises from before the election, so how would you expect them to keep their promises now?                     But one promise we can be absolutely sure of is that they will bring back the carbon tax; we can be absolutely sure of that. And I say to the member for McMahon: on paid parental leave, we believe, for a whole lot of reasons, that women should have the same pay as men. We believe that a mother and her family should not be financially penalised for having a child. We believe that it is a workplace entitlement. We believe that small business should have the very same opportunity as large business -                      and as the public sector to pay their employees the same amount of money when it comes to paid parental leave. We believe that women should not be financially penalised for having a child.                     Secondly, the Labor Party made a huge number of announcements in relation to taxation savings in the last budget, and when we came in to government the Treasury advised us that they could not be legislated. And why? Because Labor was so incompetent at drafting taxation policy that they were undeliverable policy announcements. Look no further than the mining tax, which under Labor had five different drafts and then, at the end of the day, raised just three per cent of what it promised.                 So, Labor is a complete fraud when it comes to taxation policy. They do not know how to write it, and when they introduce the taxes all they do is harm the Australian economy. And the third key thing about Labor that the Australian people ought to understand is that you can never trust what Labor says; you can only look at what they do. And when it comes to Labor, they will promise to have surpluses -                      They will promise to fix the debt and deficit, but the fact is that they do everything they possibly can to ensure that the budget is worse off, and they do everything they possibly can to ensure that at the end of the day every Australian pays for the incompetence of bad Labor governments.

  I thank the honourable member for his question, because today is a great day for Australians. This burden of the carbon tax -                      has been lifted from their shoulders. They have had to wait nine long months since giving a government the mandate to get rid of this carbon tax for it to actually happen, because Labor has resisted it to the end. Labor has resisted it even though they promised in Townsville before the election that they would get rid of the carbon tax. Labor is a friend of the carbon tax and will stay that way well and truly into the future. They have declared that. If they promise at the next election that they are going to get rid of it, that promise will be just as empty as the promises in 2010 and 2013.                 But at last it has happened: Australian householders will have the burden of a $550-a-year cost lifted from their bills. The $9 billion hit on Australian jobs will be gone. These are the sorts of things that make a real difference to our economy. Our power bills go down, our business becomes more competitive, and we are able to supply products more efficiently and more competitively to the rest of the world. This is going to deliver real benefits to the Australian economy and to Australian consumers. And I congratulate the mayor of Brisbane, Australia's biggest local authority, which has been amongst the first off the block to make the commitment that they will reduce rates -                      as a result of the abolition of the carbon tax - reduced rates. The next rate bill that the people of Brisbane receive -                      will include a $36 refund. The people of Brisbane will receive a $36 refund because the carbon tax is gone. Their costs will be lower. The cost of disposing of garbage will be lower and they are passing on that benefit to the Brisbane ratepayers.                 Other local authorities, I hope, will take the lead. Other businesses also are obligated to take the lead, and this government, as promised in the election, has committed extra resources to the ACCC to make sure that these benefits are in fact passed on. The men and women of Australia know they voted for this tax to be eliminated, they wanted it to happen and now this government has delivered.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. I note that her concern for better connectivity in rural Australia is shared by all of my colleagues here, but it is not shared by the men and women on the opposition benches. For the six years of Labor government, not one cent of Commonwealth money was spent on rectifying or addressing mobile phone black spots in regional Australia. Tens of billions of dollars were committed to the NBN. Yet they knew - as we all know - that when you are out of the big cities the biggest telecommunications issue is invariably black spots for mobile telephony, wireless broadband and wireless voice services. That is the biggest issue.                 Under the Howard government, over $100 million was spent on dealing with those black spots and, under the Abbott government, $100 million has been committed over the next four years to address those black spots. The honourable member has nominated a number of black spots in her electorate. I note that my parliamentary secretary, Paul Fletcher, has gone the length and the breadth of the country. He has been to 50 public meetings in 32 electorates to hear from people about mobile phone black spots. The wide, open spaces of Sydney's North Shore cannot constrain him! He has gone all over the countryside and he has found out that there are many, many deficiencies in our mobile coverage.                 I am not sure that I would be as confident as the honourable member is that Thailand and Bhutan have 100 per cent mobile coverage. I am sure there are a few black spots there too. But, nonetheless, while we do have very good mobile coverage overall in Australia, there are many areas where it is not good and we are addressing them. This is what we are doing: we are spending $100 million over four years. We have a process underway which will shortly be released for consultation with the industry and then, very soon after that, made public. It will be a fully transparent, competitive process.                 We are looking, naturally, for the mobile network operators to make contributions to these new towers. We expect that we can fund between 250 and 300 of them. We are delighted by the interest being shown by the government of Victoria, which is promising to commit $40 million - and that should become part of the co-funding with us - and the government of Western Australia, which has committed $45 million. We are also looking forward to support from local government, whether it is in cash or in kind, such as providing land and access. This is a serious commitment to addressing the biggest telecommunications deficiency in regional Australia and it stands in marked contrast to the six years of neglect by Labor.

  I thank the honourable member for Forrest for her question. It is a hugely important question, because abolishing the carbon tax is part of our Economic Action Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy and help create more jobs. We can do that by getting rid of taxes like the carbon tax and the mining tax and by allowing our nation to be more competitive when in head-to-head challenges with economies that do not have a carbon tax or a mining tax. According to Treasury analysis, as a result of the abolition of the carbon tax, the Australian economy will be larger and inflation will be lower. Ultimately, that means that more jobs will be created. The abolition of the carbon tax will save the Australian economy $11 million a day, it will lift a $9 billion yearly burden off the shoulders of everyday Australians and it will on average benefit every household by around $550 this year alone - $550 per household as a result of getting rid of the carbon tax.                 The Labor Party, or at least some of them, should be celebrating the abolition of the carbon tax, because just over a year ago they promised the Australian people that if the Labor Party were re-elected they would terminate the carbon tax. But, within their nature, they do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha. They do not know what their position is, but what we know is that today the Leader of the Opposition has pledged to reintroduce the carbon tax. Today the Leader of the Opposition has pledged that, should you vote for the Labor Party at the next election, you will get another carbon tax. Whatever it may be called, the Australian people will get another carbon tax that will increase the cost of living for everyday Australians - because that is what it was designed to do.                  The carbon tax was designed to increase the cost of everything in the economy that uses energy. Australia is not only one of the world's leading exporters of energy; it obviously also consumes energy. As a result of getting rid of this tax on energy, our economy will be stronger, our population will be wealthier and there will be more job opportunities. The only problem is - the only threat is - that if anyone ever votes for the Labor Party again, we will see the carbon tax back again.

  I simply point out to the member for Charlton that, under the modelling the former government produced for its carbon-tax-cum-emissions-trading-scheme, our iron and steel production was forecast to reduce by 20 per cent.                     I simply remind the member that the modelling the former government produced for its carbon-tax-cum-emissions-trading scheme showed that it would reduce Australia's iron and steel production by some 20 per cent and reduce Australia's aluminium production by some 60 per cent. Cities like Whyalla, dependent upon these industries, were in big trouble - but now they are not, because the carbon tax is gone. I am looking forward to visiting the people of Whyalla and reassuring them that at last they have a government that is on their side.

  I say to the member for Cowan that as part of our economic action strategy of getting rid of the carbon tax and fixing the budget - as a result of those initiatives and many more - we can build a stronger more robust economy where more jobs are created and every household has the opportunity to enjoy greater prosperity.                 In the interim, the best way to do that is to pass the budget. Why pass the budget? Because it is a credible plan that has been laid down to start the repair job on the horrible legacy of Labor - $123 billion in deficits, $667 billion of debt, and rising unemployment in an environment where you have falling terms of trade. I am not the only one saying this. We have had the Governor of the Reserve Bank saying 'Get on with it.' The Secretary of the Treasury is saying, 'Get on with it.' Moody's credit rating is saying, 'Get on with it.' The Parliamentary Budget Officer is saying, 'Get on with it.' Then there are John Edwards from the RBA, and Angel Gurria from the OECD. Even Wayne Swan, who described the budget position as 'ruinous' said that you have to have budget repair.                 The starting point for budget repair must be for the Labor Party to stand by its own promises to implement savings from the last budget. The Labor Party was so concerned about the state of the budget last year that they introduced a whole lot of savings measures. Even today, the member for McMahon had the chutzpah to stand up here and say, 'Back us on our former savings measures.' The only problem is that Labor is not backing their former savings measures.                 This morning we saw the Leader of the Opposition on the AM program. When Chris Uhlmann was speaking to him it was like listening to Clarke and Dawe. Chris Uhlmann asked:                 _ why won't you even back your own cuts?                 Bill Shorten replied:                 Chris, we're the Labor Party.                 Oh, I understand now! He won't back his own policies, because he is in the Labor Party. Chris Uhlmann then asked:                 _ you're now not even agreeing to cuts that you proposed yourself _ . Why's that?                 Bill Shorten replied:                 Well, Chris, first of all, the world has changed a lot in the last 12 months.                 Chris Uhlmann then asked:                 _ why won't you back the cuts that you proposed yourself?                 To which Bill Shorten replied:                 _ how can we agree to what this rotten Government is doing?                 It is your government that proposed the cuts. How can anyone have sense like this. Bill Shorten was asked how you fix the budget. He said:                 Well, the budget task is always to make sure you've got a proper balance between expenditure and revenue _                 Well done! An economic genius - a budget idiot!

  I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that contrary to his assertions there are no cuts of the nature that he suggests. None whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition should stop scaring vulnerable people.                     As for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, it will be delivered by this government. It will be delivered competently and sustainably. That is more than anyone ever could have said about anything done by members opposite, because everything that members opposite touched they destroyed. They could not help themselves.                   The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                     They were incompetent in government and they are irresponsible in opposition. They were wreckers in government, and now they just want to wreck everything. That is what they do. They just want to wreck everything. Frankly, the members opposite should have a good, long, hard look at themselves. They should have a chat to Bob Hawke and Paul Keating and ask themselves how decent, responsible Labor people should behave. That is what they should do.                     But the Prime Minister just misled the House.

  I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. He knows, as do other members on this side of the House, that the coalition is taking strong and effective action on climate change. We are delivering on our target to reduce emissions through our Direct Action plan.                   The member for Scullin then left the chamber.                     We are working constructively with others to secure a new global climate agreement, in 2015. If measured against the same benchmarks, our target of five per cent reduction in emissions on 2000 levels is a comparable commitment across a range of measures to the United States and Canada and Korea and our other major trading partners. In fact Australia's commitment means that we will have the highest emissions reduction per capita in the world. Australia and the United States also have comparable policy approaches on carbon emissions. Just as we have rejected a tax on carbon, the United States Climate Action Plan, like our Direct Action Plan, does not include a carbon price, nor emissions trading, nor a carbon tax. Likewise, G20 members including Argentina, Brazil -                      Canada, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey do not have nor plan to introduce an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax. In fact there is no arrangement anywhere in the world which mirrored the economy-wide fixed carbon tax imposed by the Labor government. Until it was repealed today, the carbon tax was a fixed $25.40 per tonne. Even the European Union's emissions trading scheme was only $8 a tonne. Labor's carbon tax was a $7.6 billion hit on the economy in its first year and it did virtually nothing to reduce global greenhouse emissions.                 The repeal of the carbon tax today will be a relief to many businesses. I quote from Tourism Accommodation Australia, which has a number of small businesses in its membership. It spoke of profit reductions of up to 12 per cent attributable to increased costs related to the carbon tax. We know that Labor's tax was actually designed to drive up prices and make Australia less competitive. Its own report warned that some regions of Australia would be vulnerable to large-scale loss of livelihood as a result of the implementation of a carbon price. That is not even code. That meant massive job losses attributable to the carbon tax.                  This government will take a responsible approach to the issue so that we play our part in protecting the environment without unnecessary and punitive taxes which were so out of step with the rest of the world. Every time energy prices went up under Labor's tax, it increased pressure on our small businesses. That has now gone. We have repealed the tax. We are in line with the rest of the world.

  For the benefit of the member who asked the question and for the benefit of the carer she has been talking to, I want to reassure her, the House and the Australian people that there are no cuts to the carer payment, the carer allowance or the carer supplement in the budget. There are no cuts to those payments in the budget.                     The only cut that has been proposed to carers in recent times was back in 2008, when members opposite attempted to scrap the carer bonus altogether. The only cut that has been proposed to carers in recent times was by the Labor Party back in 2008, when they attempted to abolish the carer payment, and it did not happen, because the coalition successfully opposed it.                  I just say again to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - who really should be better than this, who really should be above scaring vulnerable people - yes, we have had to make a range of difficult decisions, but we have only made these difficult decisions because someone had to clean up Labor's mess. Given that Labor was incapable of cleaning up its own mess, the people of Australia voted for the coalition to do the job that Labor was incapable of. And we will do this job. We will do it in a competent, trustworthy way and in a way which is as compassionate as it can be under the circumstances in which we find ourselves.

  I am very pleased to get this question from the member for Dobell today, because today is a great day for Australian families and Australian businesses because the carbon tax has finally been abolished. It has taken the government a great struggle because of the opposition of the Leader of the Opposition to listening to the Australian public. The message from the Australian public at last year's election was that they wanted the carbon tax gone. Since the Copenhagen conference, since the collapse of those talks, every reputable published opinion poll has indicated that the Australian people do not support the job-destroying, price-increasing carbon tax.                  If that were not enough, in the election last year the Australian public voted in a referendum to abolish the carbon tax. At the Griffith by-election they sent the message to the Labor Party again that they wanted the carbon tax gone by swinging to the coalition - the best swing to a government since 1984 in a by-election in an opposition seat.                     In the Western Australian Senate by-election, when Labor and the Greens thought they would do well, their vote went backwards. In Western Australia they voted again to abolish the carbon tax.                     So, time and again, the Australian public have indicated that they want the carbon tax scrapped, and today the Senate scrapped the carbon tax.                  But someone is not listening, and that is the Leader of the Opposition. He refuses to listen to the Australian public. I can tell Bill we will hang this around his neck like a rotten, stinking carcass right through to election day at the end of 2016. You have given the coalition a whole new lease of life, Bill, because we can now tell the Australian public with great confidence that if they vote Labor at the next election the carbon tax will be reintroduced - the job-destroying, price-rising carbon tax that cost Julia Gillard her prime ministership, Kevin Rudd his prime ministership the first time and arguably the second time, and it is going to cost you the prime ministership of Australia. I will tell you who is pleased about that: Chris Bowen, sitting right behind you, member for Maribyrnong. He is waiting for you to fall over on the carbon tax, just like your predecessors. And I am looking forward to that day.                 Â

  I trust that the member who asked the question was honest with the employer that he was in contact with. If he was being as honest as members of parliament should be with their constituents, he would have said: 'Sure, the Tools For Your Trade payment is going, but the trade support loans are coming.' The trade support loan is four times the size of the Tools For Your Trade grant. That means there is four times as much support available to apprentices from this government than was available from members opposite - a pretty good deal for the apprentices of Australia, including the apprentices the member asked me about.

  I can inform the House that the carbon tax is gone. I want to thank the member for Gilmore because, like every member on this side of the House, she campaigned on a plan to heal the nation's economy and on a pledge to repeal the carbon tax. She and every member of this House have delivered what they planned, what they promised and what they pledged to the Australian people. It is a lesson that the other side might take to heart. It means immediate benefits for business. What have we already heard from business today?                     Let me turn to what the National Farmers' Federation has already said:                 Australian agriculture is breathing a sigh of relief now the tax has finally been abolished.                 _Â Â Â _Â Â Â _                 Carbon tax flow-on costs hit Australian farmers every time they paid for essential electricity, fertiliser, chemical and fuel supplies.                 It is not just the NFF saying this sort of thing; it is the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Petroleum and Production Exploration Association, the Cement Industry Federation and the Australian Retailers Association.                 But it is not just business that benefits - Australian households are also going to benefit from the abolition of a tax which does not do the job. That is the saddest part - as the opposite know, it was a tax that singularly failed to reduce emissions. What do we know there will be for householders? There will not just be a $550 on-average reduction. The electricity providers are already making it clear that the cost of electricity will be reduced. Origin has said today that the electricity price will come down. The Electricity Retailers Association has said that the electricity price will come down.                 Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition has guaranteed that, under a government that he leads, the electricity price will go back up again. Let us be clear. When they seek to return a carbon tax dressed up as an ETS, the price will not just come back to where it is now. Under their modelling, it will go up to $38. This is what the budget said just a year ago - that the carbon tax, as a floating price, would climb to $38.                 Let me compare what occurred under those opposite with what AGL has already said today. Electricity price reductions will be backdated to 1 July 2014. I will finish with their final words to Australian households: 'You don't need to do anything - we will make sure you receive all your savings.'

  Labor's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme tax has not stopped people from getting the drugs they need.                     Let me get this right: first of all the member for Ballarat is against a modest co-payment on Medicare, and now, judging by her outburst, she is against a PBS co-payment. Just how irresponsible can Labor be?                   The member for Lalor then left the chamber.                     Just what kind of deficit do they want us to skyrocket towards when they are against all spending cuts, and now they want to abolish the PBS co-payment as well as oppose a modest co-payment on Medicare? It is really and truly about time members opposite explained themselves.

  It is great to get a question from the member for Leichhardt, and what a great treat it was to be with him in his electorate talking to many small businesses, which left us with the very clear message that we needed to axe the carbon tax. And today is that historic day. We have got rid of the carbon tax, and that will be greeted with great joy by the small business community of Australia and in the member for Leichhardt's electorate. They made it clear that this is the action they wanted to see from this government.                 It has had an impact on employment; it has made the cost of doing business more expensive than it needs to be. It made a difficult economic climate, created under Labor, that saw 519,000 jobs lost in small business even more difficult than it needed to be, and yet today we have seen this parliament repeal that tax. And it is great news for those small businesses. We have seen the Queensland regulators talk about an eight to 10 per cent reduction in energy costs; we have heard about the 8Â½ per cent reduction in power costs for the typical household in Queensland. All of this is good news: improved prospects for expenditure for households, reduced costs of doing business for those Queensland entities and households on average $550 better off.                 And we are already hearing the small business community celebrate the repeal of the carbon tax, whether it be the independent supermarkets or whether it be the independent fuel retailers. Rick Cairney from Business SA said, 'The tax was introduced two years ago and should never have been introduced as it has achieved nothing but higher power bills and damage to Australia's international competitiveness.' Mark Stone from VECCI, the small business advocates in Victoria, has also welcomed the repeal of the carbon tax. He has pointed out that the carbon tax has adversely impacted on productivity and competitiveness, that the tax has been a burden. It has reduced small business profitability, suppressed employment and added to already difficult trading conditions.                 This is a great day for the small businessmen and women of our country - they risk much; many mortgage their houses to have go at creating opportunities and wealth for others - and it is a great day for households and consumers ensuring that those carbon tax repeal savings get passed through. And Rod Sims, the ACCC Chairman, said:                 _ what went up will clearly come down when you take away the carbon price.                 There is a positive legal obligation on electricity, natural gas and synthetic greenhouse gas suppliers to pass on those savings from abolishing the carbon tax.                 Consumers will also get an estimate of the savings from network electricity and gas retailers as a result of the abolition of the carbon tax. We know there is greater transparency with estimates being provided by electricity producers and retailers, and natural gas suppliers, to their customers about what that saving should be and then a requirement to substantiate those savings to the ACCC. This is a great day for small business, a great day for consumers and I want to add my thanks not only to the Minister for the Environment but also to the ACCC staff and the Treasury staff who worked very hard to make sure these savings are passed through. It is a great day with the repeal of the carbon tax.

  As a result of this government's budget, there will continue to be a strong and generous social safety net. For instance, a single-income family with three dependents, one aged under six and two aged between six and 13, earning $60,000 in 2016-17, after this government's budget, will receive $17,920 in government payments. The same family earning $70,000 will receive $15,970 in government payments. So this is a government that is more than ready to sustain and support a generous social security system. But the only way we can support a generous social security system is to get Labor's debt and deficit disaster under control. It is the only way. The only way that we can continue to support a generous social security system is by getting the budget back under control.                 We need to pay social security benefits out of revenue and not out of borrowings, and that is what Labor do not understand. Labor think you can keep borrowing money to pay out. We think that what needs to happen is that the revenue the government receives has got to cover the payments the government makes. It is a very simple equation. If you cannot raise the money, you cannot spend the money. We understand that, members opposite do not, which is why members opposite just cannot be trusted with the budget. They have proved that over six years. They just cannot be trusted with the economy and that means they just cannot be trusted in government.

  I thank the member for Murray for her question, because the member for Corio has clearly running out of puff this week - two questions was far too much for him.                 Resolve is important when it comes to dealing with these questions and the same resolve we have put on the borders is the same resolve the Minister for the Environment has shown in seeing the end of the carbon tax. There is no carbon tax under the government this Prime Minister leads. That is not a promise; that is an absolute fact. Well done to the Minister for the Environment and the Prime Minister. What we need, though, is resolution in all of these policies - the right policies in competent hands and the right resolve to back up those policies. This government on our borders will never, ever give an inch to people smugglers anywhere, any time. You will not find this government going straight to the option of the water taxi. But on that side, that was the practice every single day they were in government when these issues were presented.                 The Australian people can now that we will exhaust any and every option to ensure that people-smuggling ventures are not successful into this country, and for almost seven months that has been the record of this government. Labor's failure has been one of policy when they were in government, has been one of competence when they were in government, but most of all it has been in resolve. They were weak in government and they are proving to be even weaker in opposition when it comes to our borders.                 We have the shadow minister now abandoning the enhanced screening policy. It was implemented on 33 occasions by those opposite when they were in government and they said quite plainly that it meets our international obligations. In addition to that, those opposite want to wind up the water taxi again. The first option, as soon as the whistle blows from the people smugglers, the member for Corio, if he were the minister, he would have the water taxi out there in a heartbeat. That is not what this government is going to do. It is not what this government has ever done. We will never give an inch to those people smugglers.                 I referred to those opposite yesterday in this House as a swarm of jellyfish, a bloom of jellyfish. What we will get from them is the jellyfish solution if they ever get back into government. But it will not be a jellyfish with a sting; it will be a jellyfish that has no spine, it will be a jellyfish that will just be taken away by every single current would take them in whatever direction they may be taken on. But not this government. Whether we win every battle or not when it comes to the people smugglers, our campaign against the people smugglers is succeeding, will succeed and will continue to succeed under the policies of this government.
