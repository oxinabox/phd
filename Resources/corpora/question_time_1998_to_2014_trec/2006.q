     I refer to his statement to the parliament on 25 March 2003 when he said:.
    .
    .
     the oil for food program has been immorally and shamefully rorted by Saddam Hussein, who has used the proceeds of it to acquire his weapons capacity .
    .
    .
    In the middle of the Iraq war, with Australian troops in the field, why did the Prime Minister turn a blind eye to multiple warnings that Australia was the biggest contributor to this immoral and shameful rort, including Canadian government warnings in December 1999, warnings conveyed through the United Nations in January 2000 and warnings repeated by the UN in March 2000, which were all to the effect that Australia's own AWB was rorting the oil for food programs to the financial benefit of Saddam Hussein?
     There were a few others as well.

     Deputy Prime Minister, how could DFAT have written back to the AWB just three days later formally advising them that this would not contravene sanctions against Iraq, without getting a written legal opinion, without to this day being able to track down the legal officer in the department who is responsible for consulting with them on this matter and without even bothering to consult the UN, despite your statement today that it was the UN and not the government that had the power to approve contract arrangements with Iraq?

     Given that this statement by Mr Rogers was made more than three weeks ago, the Volcker inquiry has been ongoing for about two years and that the contract changes that we are talking about were at the very beginning of what was to become a five-year long $300 million scandal, how on earth can you stand up in the parliament today and evade answering the question?
     Will you report back to parliament by the end of the day on the question I just asked?

    .

     the Iraqis add bogus additional charges like 'inland transportation' when the goods arrive at ports, or buy goods at inflated prices, often 10 percent or more over the necessary price.

     Prime Minister, given that another grant from the Namoi Valley structural adjustment program given to some Namoi Valley ground water irrigators in the Carrol area near Gunnedah has not been subject to taxation, even though both adjustment programs are to alleviate the same problem and assist irrigators to adjust to reductions in ground water allocations, and given the confused position that many irrigators and their accountants find themselves in, could you please explain and release for public scrutiny the methodology used to establish the different taxation regimes for these two structural adjustment programs?
     -  - This is a serious question.

     Is the Prime Minister aware that Mr Brendan Stewart, the AWB chairman, told Mr Volcker in a letter dated 20 September last year that:AWB did not make or conceal any illicit payments to the former Iraqi regime.
    And elsewhere:For example, it is obvious from your latest report that the committee is concerned about the use of fees for fictitious trucking services paid to alleged transport companies.
     AWB played no part in this.
     We did not sit within this category.
    Given these statements and many others that I could have read out by Mr Stewart, which have now been shown to be demonstrably false, why did the Prime Minister yesterday invite Mr Stewart to join the delegation to Iraq?

     It goes further to the letter from which I quoted, where Mr Stewart, on behalf of AWB, says:AWB did not use or make payments to a fictitious transport company.
     As far as AWB knew, the inland transportation component of its UN approved contracts was legitimate.
    Given that this letter was copied to you, Prime Minister - even though you seem to think you have no knowledge of it - and that the materials in it are so demonstrably false in terms of everything that has been presented to the Cole commission and to Volcker's own inquiries, is there no other person in the grain business capable of conducting this foray to Iraq effectively other than Mr Stewart, who is so deeply compromised by these things?

     There were no alarm bells.
    ' Why did the Prime Minister make that statement when his government received this cable dated 13 January 2000 which contained the following warnings from the UN office for the Iraq program: first, the Iraqis were demanding a surcharge of $US14 per metric tonne for wheat, which would be paid outside the oil for food program; second, the funds were to provided into a bank account in Jordan; third, the system was designed to provide illegal revenue for Iraq in US dollars; fourth, the UN believed the company involved in the scheme was owned by the son of Saddam Hussein; and, fifth, the AWB had concluded contracts of a similar nature to this with the Iraqi regime?

     Deputy Prime Minister, how much other money did Mr Flugge have access to?
     Given that DFAT indicated that the 2003-04 AusAID budget allocated $4 million to revitalising the agricultural sector and quick impact activities, can the minister outline to parliament how much of this $4 million was at the discretion of his National Party mate Mr Flugge?

     Why did the minister mislead parliament by using the excuse that he had not been briefed on the name of the Jordanian trucking company when it has now been revealed that for six years he had known about the fact that a Jordanian company owned by Saddam Hussein's regime had in fact been the subject of formal UN warnings concerning that company's dealing with the AWB?

     have proposals to do so because they've worked pretty well .

    Isn't it the case that the government's legislation which takes effect from today breaks that promise and reduces the 20 allowable matters to five so-called minimum standards which do not include overtime, penalty rates, shift allowances, leave loadings or casual loadings - those which make ordinary Australian workers capable of sustaining their mortgages?
     Don't ABS statistics show that, as a consequence, an average Australian employee who works overtime is now at risk of losing $233 a month in penalty rates alone?

     Prime Minister, isn't Justice Giudice right that all Australian employees have to look forward to from today is a reduction in the minimum wage in real terms?

    When the minister's office received the 23 June 2003 cable warning him that all contracts - not some contracts but all contracts - had included a kickback of between 10 per cent and 19 per cent, why did the minister fail to act and allow the AWB to continue to fund this extraordinary corruption scandal through corrupt contracts with Iraq for a further 16 months?

     Can the minister confirm whether either he or his officials organised for Mr Lindberg and other senior AWB officials to meet with Mr Volcker and his staff in New York in September-October 2005, immediately prior to the publication of the report?

     In 2002 he forecast six per cent export growth when exports in fact fell, again by 0.
    8 per cent.

     I refer to his evidence to the Cole inquiry that he did not have a 'specific recollection' of receiving or reading the critical warning cable of 13 January 2000, and further that he did not 'have a recollection six years back of precisely that'.
     Why did the minister claim in parliament on 28 February to in fact have had very specific knowledge that of course he would have read this cable?
     And he then went on to say:Obviously, this happened six years ago, but I have had the opportunity during the last few weeks to examine all of this material again very carefully, which is why I know so much about it today, 28 February 2006.
     These are cables from early 2000, but I do know a lot about them and I have examined this material very carefully.
    Isn't it the case that in February, before he was hauled before the Cole inquiry, the minister was happy to boast to parliament about his detailed knowledge of this cabled warning but then suddenly developed an acute case of amnesia when he was required to repeat the same on oath to the Cole inquiry?

    ' In light of the government's own published draft, showing Australia is self-sufficient to date in oil but will have to import 60 per cent of its requirements in 2012, could the Treasurer designate some Treasury officials to look at following America's mandated five per cent ethanol and devise an action plan to deliver Brazilian prices, currently 68c a litre, in contrast to Australia's, now $1.

     Acting Prime Minister, given that this precedent is critical in terms of natural resource policy, where entitlements are removed or reduced for the environmental and/or public good, will the government now act to correct the anomaly in the tax act so that the full amount of compensation for the loss of a capital asset will flow on to benefit not only those in receipt of the payment but also the communities which support them?

     Wasn't Senator Boswell, the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, closer to the truth when he said: 'Everyone is supporting Mark; well, nearly everyone.
     Bruce Scott's not'?
     Deputy Prime Minister, isn't the real truth that the whole Queensland National Party - A Minister can only be questioned on the following matters, for which he or she is responsible or officially connected:(i) public affairs;(ii) administration; or(iii) proceedings pending in the House.
    None of those things relates to the nature of the question being asked by the Leader of the Opposition.
     He is out of order.
     - At least the honourable member has made the case for this being persisted with.
     Quite clearly these are matters for which the minister is responsible.
     They are matters that have been dealt with in this House.
     - Deputy Prime Minister, how can you persist as Minister for Trade when the real truth is that the whole Queensland National Party has walked out and the Deputy Prime Minister is as irrelevant in his party as the Nationals are in the bush?
    _ Speakers have ruled out of order questions or parts of questions to Ministers which concern, for example: -  statements, activities, actions _ of the Minister's own party or of its conferences, officials, representatives or candidates _Quite clearly, it is out of order.

     I refer the Prime Minister to Freehills, the government's law firm of choice, which helped draft the government's industrial relations changes.
     Is the Prime Minister aware that, in a presentation in February this year, Freehills concludes that the average annual wage increase between June 2004 and June 2005 for employees on AWAs was 2.
    5 per cent - the same as the inflation rate?

    5 per cent; in agreements generally, four per cent; and, in union collective agreements, 4.

    ' I also refer to comments made by the chair of the low pay commission, Professor Ian Harper, on 31 May when he said that the government's legislation 'pushes' the low pay commission to reduce the value of the minimum wage in real terms.
     Will the Prime Minister guarantee Archbishop Pell that the minimum wage will not be reduced in real terms?

     Treasurer, while you were being warmed by Mr Latham's diaries, did you also have the chance to read Laurie Oakes in the Bulletin magazine yesterday, where Mr Oakes recalled your interview about the government's industrial relations changes on radio 2GB with Alan Jones last week, and which contained the following analysis of your performance?
     Treasurer, did you read this:By refusing to deal squarely with the questions Jones raised, by attempting to use the 'confuse and stupefy' technique, Costello came off sounding not only devious but also out of touch and even a bit thick.
    Treasurer, do you agree with Laurie Oakes?

     Why has the Howard government made it so much more expensive for young people to go to university and turned 300,000 young Australians away from TAFE at a time when the Australian economy needs 20,000 scientists and engineers and 100,000 extra tradespeople?

     Minister, does your reference to a smoking gun - in your own language, in this, your own department's record of conversation - refer to the AWB's prior knowledge of its corrupt payments to Saddam Hussein's regime, or are you referring to the government's knowledge of the 21 cables you received as warnings about this, the worst corruption scandal in Australia's history?

      - It seems they are having difficulty hearing me, Mr Speaker, which is fair enough.
     Is the Prime Minister aware that, yesterday, radio commentator Alan Jones said the following about the sale of Medibank Private:So surely, if the thing is to be sold, its members are morally entitled to the assets of the fund.
    _            _            _Worse, if you are a member _ and you think you own it, you are now going to be asked to pay for a slice of it when it's sold.
    That's _ financially unjust _Prime Minister, is Alan Jones right?

     the case made by the government was that Iraq possessed WMD in large quantities and posed a grave and unacceptable threat to the region and the world, particularly as there was a danger that Iraq's WMD might be passed to terrorist organisations.
    This is not the picture that emerges from an examination of all the assessments provided to the Committee by Australia's two analytical agencies.
    Does he also recollect from the Jull committee the following finding to which I was a signatory:Other significant intelligence not covered in the government presentations included an assessment in October 2002 that Iraq was only likely to use its WMD if the regimes survival was at stake and the view of the Joint Intelligence Committee of the UK, available at the beginning of February 2003, that war would increase the risk of terrorism and the passing of Iraq's WMD to terrorists.
    Is it not a fact, Minister, that you exaggerated the intelligence available to you to send us to war in a failed effort and that, as a result of what you have done, we now face a growing terrorist threat?

     As an expression of our commitment to the Kyoto outcome, the Howard Government ensured that Australia was among the first nations to sign the Protocol.

     the Kyoto agreement permitting Australia an 8% increase in emissions of 6 greenhouse gases by 2012 over 1990 levels will preserve the interests of farmers, miners, manufacturing industry and the economy in general.

     Does the Prime Minister agree with comments by former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, made in the Boyer lectures, that a lasting legacy of the economic management in the early 1990s was that 'Australia had an inflation rate that was in line with world's best practice; we had returned to being a low-inflation country'?
     Prime Minister, hasn't the government's failure to address skills shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks resulted in core inflation now rising above world's best practice, with real implications for the cost of living for Australia's working families?

     Kyoto provides a model for international partnership on climate change, and we should build on it.

     Is the Prime Minister aware that yesterday Senator Vanstone greeted a report on the wrongful detention of Australian kids with the claim: 'It was a good day for the government'?

    30 Report last night Senator Vanstone dodged responsibility for mismanagement of the Immigration portfolio no less than six times by blaming previous governments, ministers and the media?

     At this time when we are all looking forward to spending time with our families, how is it, Prime Minister, that as the party for family values you have brought in new industrial relations legislation which makes it harder and harder for families during the festive season to spend time with each other?
