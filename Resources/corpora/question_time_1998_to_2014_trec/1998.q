     I refer to the opinion last November of Mr Ian Callinan QC, as he then was, on the Hindmarsh Island matter, which he now acknowledges - as he did in fact last December - was an opinion requested by the responsible Minister and not a submission made directly to the Senate committee.
     Will the Attorney confirm that he, the Attorney, knew that the Callinan opinion was of this character, and therefore critically relevant to the disqualification issue, before Justice Callinan decided on 5 February that he would not disqualify himself from hearing the case?

     Prime Minister, with five million Australians waking up today to the news that their health insurance premiums will increase by up to $200 and with 700 people a day abandoning private health insurance as their tax rebate is swallowed up by premium increases, do you now admit that your health insurance tax rebates have failed dismally?
     If your Medicare levy surcharge has failed to force high income earners into private health insurance, why will your latest plan to force middle income earners into insurance be any more successful?

     Minister, do you recall claiming last month that you had never predicted that health insurance fund membership would increase?
     Minister, are you aware of the Prime Minister's claims that the reason your tax rebates and Medicare levy surcharge failed to stem the decline in health fund membership was because your policy was not introduced five years ago?
     Minister, how therefore do you explain your signature on the 1996 health portfolio budget statements which state, in the forward estimates, that they are based on the assumption that coverage would increase from 32 per cent to 34 per cent?
     Minister, how do you also explain your own press release on budget night, which claims that the Medicare levy surcharge would increase fund membership by another 1.

     A member of this parliament should be able to put it.
    We are alleging that it is a web of deceit.

     Firstly, Senator Parer still holds $2 million worth of shares in Queensland Coal Mine Management; secondly, he still holds his personal shares - 44 - in QCMM (ESP); and, thirdly, he cannot divest to his family.
     Does not the device of moving control of the shares to his family only represent a parking of the benefit until such time in the future when he regains control, as well as the continuing capital accrual in the shares?
     Prime Minister, why do you and Senator Parer continue to mock your code?

     Prime Minister, part of your code reads:Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.
     The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
    Does this still apply?

     My question to the Prime Minister goes to his non-answer to my previous question.
     Prime Minister, do you recall telling Paul Lyneham on Nightline :The guidelines say that you've got to get rid of shares in companies that are operating in the areas of your responsibility.
    Does he recall telling John Stanley on 2UE:.
     .
     .

     this is an unreasonable, unreal standard.
     Now I do not think it is .

     It follows the answer he has just given.
     Treasurer, is it not a fact that these are the best job vacancy figures only since February 1996, as opposed to what you actually happen to be saying.
     - Isn't it a fact that since you came to power there has been job vacancy growth of 18 per cent in the last two years as compared to job vacancy growth of 40 per cent in the two years prior to when you came into office?
     Isn't it also a fact that the other figures out today show a decline in weekly overtime hours per employee of some 2.
    4 per cent in the quarter for an annual decline of 7.
    3 per cent?
     That indicates something about where this economy may be going.
     Instead of boasting bogusly, Treasurer, start dealing with some real figures.

     What action will the government take to ensure that those many Australians who own Telstra shares, but who may not be aware that they will be exposed to the new anti-avoidance provisions when they divest themselves of shares, are made aware of this new proposal?

     Is it the same small business survey which shows that restoring consumer confidence is vitally or very important, to the tune of 85 per cent, but only 46 per cent describe the GST as vitally or very important?
     - Is it the same small business survey which shows that, while 89 per cent of proprietors believe that improved waterfront efficiency will have a major impact on the economy, 58 per cent said they believe the federal government has handled the dispute badly -  - and only 30 per cent thought they had handled it well?
     - Prime Minister, when are you going to restore consumer confidence by taking off consumers the threat of a GST, get your act together and produce some decent reform on the waterfront -  - in the way that the public expects?

     Given that your task force on tax reform has obeyed the Treasurer and made no recommendations, how will this influence your imminent taxation policy?
     Isn't this a similar exercise in futility as when the backbench child support committee, which actually made recommendations, was also ignored and in fact misrepresented in the party room by the Minister for Social Security?
     What is the point of inviting backbench input into policy when it is routinely ignored by you and your inner circle?

     Does the Prime Minister recall saying yesterday that there will be no more closures of post offices or mail centres in rural Australia?
     Why should Australians living in rural and regional areas believe this promise when you said before the last election that you would never ever introduce a GST, that it was `vamoose' and `kaput'?
     Given that the National Competition Council report on post services will result in the closure of many post offices and mail centres, will you now ditch this report?
     If not, why should anyone believe you when you say that their services are safe?

     Prime Minister, why do you want to tax Australian 	 families with a hidden GST every time they need a routine household service?
     How will you compensate them when they have got to pay an extra 10 per cent when the toilet blocks up, when the TV breaks down, when the washing machine blows up and when the car needs a service?
     Prime Minister, what if those bills come in the same month as the phone bill, the electricity bill, the gas bill, the rates, the car insurance and registration and the household insurance?
     Isn't your GST going to cost Australian families hundreds of dollars a year just for basic household services?

    8 to 63.
    2, it is amazing what figures you can produce.
     -  - My question is directed to the Prime Minister: do you recall saying on 16 April 1997:What I am announcing this morning is a very, very clear message to the people of Australia that until this matter is cleared up, we are not going to accept Senator Colston's vote.
    And do you recall saying on 6 May 1997:We won't accept his vote.
     Now, if that means the government has a tougher time getting legislation through the Senate, so be it.
    Why have you broken your promise regarding not accepting Senator Colston's vote and why did you not inform the voters before the election of your intentions regarding Senator Colston's vote?

     Prime Minister, is it not the case that the household expenditure survey documents that the Treasurer released yesterday understate the real impact of the GST on pensioners and self-funded retirees because they do not take into account different savings rates - a factor pointed out by Dr Neil Warren this morning?
     Dr Warren is a person that you, Prime Minister, have described as Australia's pre-eminent indirect tax expert.
     Is it not also the case that the household expenditure survey documents confirm that the real impact of the GST on pensioners will be up to 30 per cent higher than the government has let on - not 1.
    9 per cent, as released in your package, but 2.
    5 per cent?

     Minister, doesn't this show how unnecessarily complex your GST is?
     - How do you expect - no sales tax on Panadeine -  -  - No sales tax on Panadeine - absolutely none.
