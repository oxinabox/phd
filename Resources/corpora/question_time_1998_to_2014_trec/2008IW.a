My Department has been undertaking an audit of Commonwealth laws to identify provisions that discriminate against people in same-sex relationships (taking account of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report Same-Sex: Same Entitlements). The focus of the Commission's report was on financial and work-related legislation that discriminates against same-sex couples and their children. The Department's audit covered other areas of life in Australia.The audit confirmed the findings of the Commission's report and has identified federal legislation in these areas that discriminate against same-sex couples and their children. Areas of discrimination include taxation, social security, superannuation, workplace laws and education assistance. I am consulting with my Department and relevant Ministers about the implementation of these reforms, including timeframes.</DOC>

All agencies subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) are required to report procurement contracts awarded on AusTender (the Government's tender and procurement reporting system) where the contract value is $10,000 or more.Of the 99 FMA Act agencies which were required to gazette their contract details, 97 agencies have complied with the new reporting requirements, including reporting consultancy status, that took effect on 1 July 2007. The remaining agencies, the Department of Defence and the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO), have yet to fully transition to the new reporting requirements.All contract details reported on AusTender are publicly available at www.tenders.gov.au. As at 5 May 2008, the 97 agencies which have so far reported on AusTender, entered into 543 consultancies, comprising a total amount of $50,656,114, for the period identified. Individual details for these consultancies can be found on AusTender under the Reports menu. The reports can be extracted on a whole of government or individual agency basis.The Department of Defence has informed me that for Defence and DMO, the total number and value of consultancies entered into for the period identified is 203 at $17,198,630. Of these amounts, Defence let 168 contracts with a value of $14,038,241 and DMO 35 contracts valued at $3,160,389. Defence will also subject these amounts to further quality assurance as part of Defence's annual reporting obligations.While AusTender contains details of contracts valued at $10,000 or more, I consider that it would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for agencies to provide details of all consultancies valued at less than $10,000.</DOC>

Support for Australia's National Bowel Cancer Screening Program will be considered in the negotiation of the next National Healthcare Agreement. The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed on 26 March 2006 that the new health care agreement would be signed in December 2008 with a commencement date for the new funding arrangements of 1 July 2009.In the 2008-09 Budget, the Government committed funding of $87.4 million over the next 3 years to continue the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program for 55 and 65 year olds and extend it to 50 year olds. The National Bowel Cancer Screening Program will be implemented by the Government, in partnership with state and territory governments, from 1 July 2008 and will offer testing to people turning 50, 55 or 65 years of age between 2008 and 2010. Up to 2.5 million people will receive an invitation to participate in the program.This program includes funding to establish a national framework for ongoing implementation of the program, including a structure for workforce planning, training and support; and ensuring sufficient coordination services and quality assurance mechanisms are in place. The Government will further support the states and territories, through the next Australian Health Care Agreements, to provide follow up services for participants with a positive result.This commitment is an important step towards screening all people aged 50 years and above every two years.</DOC>

The majority of all medical and allied health requests for treatment, including dental treatment, are provided to the veteran community on presentation of their Gold and White Repatriation Health Card to their treating provider.  The vast majority of health services do not require prior approval by my Department.My Department has consolidated all medical and allied health treatment telephone and processing work into the Adelaide office.  I am advised that there were delays in processing some requests for approval of dental treatment by the Medical and Allied Health section following the finalisation of this consolidation initiative in December 2007.The logistics of consolidating these services for the whole of Australia into a single location initially caused some delays in processing requests.  The causes of these delays have been addressed and approval processes are now more efficient. Although the majority of dental treatment requests for Gold and White Card holders do not require prior approval, the procedures that do are often complex and/or extensive.  Approval of these requests may take some time to process as my Department relies on gathering a range of advice from contracted clinical experts and outside treating clinicians to ensure a safe outcome.  The time taken to complete this process may be extended if my Department has not received all the clinical information required.  These processes continue to be reviewed and improved.and (c) Appropriate dental treatment for veterans is a high priority of my Department.  The operational changes made during the last twelve months will significantly streamline dental approvals for our veterans and ensure consistent, high quality services to providers and veterans regardless of where they live. </DOC>

I am informed by my Department that it is not aware of any difficulties being experienced by veterans, their families, or providers in seeking case information from the Adelaide branch of the Medical and Allied Health section.In November 2007, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) introduced a single toll-free number to contact the Medical and Allied Health section. Veterans and their treating doctors have access to skilled staff on this number from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm, Monday to Friday, when calling from any State or Territory of Australia. Where family members have a legal power of attorney, they too can make use of this service.Currently, the staff answer some 3,500 to 4,000 calls per week from veterans and providers. Except during peak periods and other unforseen circumstances, calls should be answered, on average, in under one minute.As with all programs within DVA, performance is regularly monitored.</DOC>

The following table derived from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's (AIHW) annual publication, Child Protection Australia provides data for the number of Indigenous children aged 0-17 years in out-of-home care by state and territory at 30 June for the past eleven years. There is no published national data for children in out- of-home care prior to 1997.
 Figures for Indigenous children in out-of-home care across Australian jurisdictions at 30 June for the eleven years from 1997-2007
 Victoria was unable to disaggregate Indigenous children and other children in the 1999 reporting periodAs each jurisdiction operates under separate child protection legislation, this data must be read with caution. Also, data taken at a point in time (30 June) each year in eight different jurisdictions with different legislation, policy and practices, subject to review and modification over time, should be interpreted with caution.The AIHW, which is the main source of statistics on out-of-home care in Australian states and territories, does not include information on restorations to families or subsequent removals from those families.</DOC>

There are currently no plans to close any DSTO facilities, but there are plans to upgrade facilities in Melbourne, Edinburgh, Sydney and Scottsdale.Melbourne  -  DSTO plans to upgrade its facilities at Fishermans Bend in a staged manner with Stage 3 being completed in 2016. This will provide a number of new laboratories and the upgrading of existing laboratories and office accomodation to meet current and future demands. This is further augmented by a series of physical, passive defence measures to ensure these upgrades are appropriately protected.Edinburgh  -  DSTO plans to update its facilities at Edinburgh in a staged manner with Stage 1 being completed in 2016. DSTO's two highest priorities for this site (secure communications and training facilities) are currently being progressed at an estimated cost of $25m.Sydney  -  DSTO is developing a new waterfront facility at HMAS Penguin as part of the Penguin Redevelopment Project.Scottsdale  -  DSTO is upgrading the Manufacturing Facility at Scottsdale.Melbourne  -  $130m.Edinburgh  -  Project planning for remaining requirements has not commenced, the cost is not yet known.Sydney  -  $3m.Scottsdale  -  $3.5m.None.None.Melbourne  -  Stage 3 upgrades will provide additional research capability for DSTO Fishermans Bend staff particularly in the areas of Human Protection and Performance, Air Vehicles and Maritime Platforms Divisions.Edinburgh  -  A secure communications project will provide DSTO with appropriate accommodation for its Corporate Information Services staff and IT infrastructure, who presently occupy a WWII ammunition storage facility. A training facility project will provide DSTO with the capability to conduct in-house training as well as accommodate highly secure and sensitive events with coalition partners in an appropriately classified facility.Sydney  -  This facility replaces the Pyrmont waterfront facility due to lease expiry.Scottsdale  -  The manufacturing facility will be upgraded.Modernising and adapting its facilities to support the changing demands of its scientific work will have a beneficial impact on DSTO's ability to fulfil its obligations.</DOC>

The running costs of Caring for our Country are no higher, and are indeed, similar to the combined running costs of the previous natural resource management programs. There will be some costs related to implementing the new program arrangements but these will be more than offset by the efficiencies gained in streamlining the administrative processes and integrating the previous four natural resource management programs into one program to be delivered through a single program delivery arrangement.The limited amount of stationery and promotional material that is held for the existing natural resource management programs will be used, if possible, or recycled. As it is, existing stocks of stationery and promotional material are meagre because the 2007-08 financial year is the final year for both the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Landcare Program; the Environmental Stewardship Program had not yet begun; and Working on Country has produced limited promotional material as it targets a very specific stakeholder group.</DOC>

I can advise the honourable member that in the last 5 years the Australian Government has made available just under $24.5million to Anglican and Catholic places of worship for restoration and/or conservation works. Approximately $500 000 of this amount was granted under the National Heritage Investment Initiative, with the remainder being provided through special appropriations by the former Government. While additional funding has been provided for these purposes in the preceding 10 years, this funding came from a range of programs and details are difficult to readily access.</DOC>

There are currently around 277,000 holders of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card.The total in benefits for a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holder may vary due to a range of factors. These include the number of prescription medicines or Medicare services they require and whether they have a home internet connection for Telephone Allowance purposes. Some State and Territory Governments and third party concession providers may offer additional concessions to these card holders.The Australian Government's main purpose in issuing concession cards is to provide access to concession rate Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescription medicines and certain Medicare services, at a cheaper rate. Holders of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card can receive Seniors Concession Allowance of $500 a year and Telephone Allowance of $88 a year, plus a further $44 a year if they have a home internet connection.</DOC>

In respect of the report, 'Child mums in cycle of neglect', by Paul Toohey in The Australian on 29 February 2008, I have read the report. Australian Government legislation has ensured that in making bail and sentencing decisions under Northern Territory law, the seriousness of criminal behaviour cannot be lessened or aggravated because of customary law or cultural practice. The Government supports the Northern Territory Emergency Response and has established an independent Review Board to examine whether measures will deliver the intended results, whether any unintended consequences have emerged and whether other measures should be developed. Measures under the NTER include increased policing to improve community safety and law enforcement, child health checks, child protection workers to establish mobile child protection teams, and recruitment of Aboriginal family and community workers. There are also targeted initiatives such as Core of Life's Pregnancy, Birth, Breastfeeding and Early Parenting Program which aims to reduce teenage pregnancy and has proven to be successful in achieving this in other locations. It is an educational and peer mentoring model delivered in a culturally specific way to NT communities identified in need of this program. Funding for this program has been continued in 2008 - 09.The Government is developing a national child protection framework, driven by consultation with appropriate stakeholders including state and territory governments, peak organisations and non government organisations working with children, families and out-of-home care systems. The framework will be practical, action focused and based on partnership with state and territory governments and the non-government sector. Responses to Indigenous children will be informed by evidence of what worked in the NTER and in other interventions, both in Australia and internationally. An Indigenous 'expert committee' comprised of Indigenous service providers, academics and peak organisations is also being consulted. Existing measures under the framework include the National Indigenous Violence and Child Abuse Intelligence taskforce. Its work includes improving national coordination in the collection and sharing of information and intelligence; and conducting research on identification of good practice in preventing, detecting and responding to child abuse in Indigenous communities.</DOC>

and (b) A $1 million funding boost to cut assessment waiting times in New South Wales was announced on 17 March 2008.This funding included $250,000 for a mobile Rapid Response Team pilot in far northern New South Wales and northern Sydney. Additional funding for assessors was also directed to the following ACATs across New South Wales to increase the number and timeliness of assessments: Blacktown; Camperdown; Dubbo; Eurobodalla; Hunter Rural; Hunter Urban; Illawarra/Shoalhaven; Northern Tablelands; Richmond Valley; Sutherland; Tweed Valley; Waverley; Westmead/Auburn; and Wingecarribee.NSW Health refers to the Rapid Response Team as Mobile Assessment Support. A Mobile Assessment Support Team (MAST) has been established to operate in the Northern Sydney Central Coast area, and MAST Clinical and Administrative Support has been provided in far northern New South Wales.The number of assessors on the Mobile Assessment Support Teams and additional assessors within the ACATs to which additional funding was provided is not known at this time. NSW Health will be providing a report to the Department of Health and Ageing in September 2008.The latest published waiting time data for an ACAT assessment is at the state/territory level in the 2005-06 ACAP Minimum Data Set Report available at: www.health.gov.au/acats. (b) The Department of Health and Ageing does not have data on how many elderly people are currently waiting for an assessment. (c) The Department of Health and Ageing does not keep a list of vacant aged care beds and unused Community Care Packages.ACATs should respond to referrals in a timely and efficient manner by allocating a priority category at the time of referral. The priority categories are:1.     Within 48 hours: refers to a client who, based on information available at referral, requires an immediate response. An urgent assessment is required if the person's safety is at risk or there is a high likelihood that the person will be hospitalised or required to leave their current residence because they are unable to care for themselves, or their carer is unavailable. This may be due to a crisis in the home involving either the client or the carer or sudden change in the client's or carer's medical, physical, cognitive or psychological status.2.     Between 3 and 14 days: where available information at referral indicates that the client is not at immediate risk of harm.3.     More than 14 days: where the referral information indicates that the client has sufficient support available at present, but requires an assessment in anticipation of their future care requirements.Within 48 hours: refers to a client who, based on information available at referral, requires an immediate response.

In December 2004 the then Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) released a payment of $52,867 to Murawina in line with the payment schedule under the 2004-05 Child Care Services Support Program Funding Agreement between FaHCSIA and Murawina.As the payment was released under the existing operational funding agreement, the service was legally entitled to use the money for any purpose specified in that funding agreement, including wages. FaHCSIA did not have the legal right to insist the money be paid to workers.No, the money is not unaccounted for. The NSW Office of Fair Trading advised FaHCSIA in 2005 that the money had been spent by the Cooperative for purposes allowable under the operational funding agreement.Not applicable.</DOC>

I am advised that operational funding agreements between the Murawina Mt Druitt Cooperative Limited and the then Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) was the basis for managing all accountability issues, including probity and governance requirements and conditions in relation to funding allocated under the Child Care Services Support Program.Under the terms of the funding agreements, the Centre was required to comply with the provisions of all relevant statutes, regulations, by-laws, and requirements of any Commonwealth, State, Territory, or Local Authority. The Centre was also required to provide annual financial audited reports and annual project reports to the then FaHCSIA. The Child Care Services Support Program of the then FaHCSIA monitored compliance with funding agreements through program management arrangements. This was through service visits, telephone, email contact and assessment of submitted reports on financial and service progress.I am advised that matters in relation to the funding agreements were followed up by FaHCSIA officers through what were the normal program/contract management arrangements. The then FaHCSIA sought legal advice through the Australian Government Solicitor about the funding agreement for Murawina Mt Druitt Cooperative Ltd prior to the termination of the agreement. The Australian Federal Police were not contacted during the life of the funding agreement. I am advised that, to the extent that there was non-adherence with the conditions of the funding agreement, this was in relation to accountability reporting requirements, and there was no information or evidence to indicate that a course of action such as advising the Australian Federal Police was required.I am advised that the last audited statements received by the then FaHCSIA were for the financial year ending 30 June 2004. These statements were received in September 2005.The 2004/05 audited statements were not received following the termination of the final funding agreement between the then FaHCSIA and Murawina Mt Druitt Cooperative Ltd, in March 2005.</DOC>

The then Department of Families, Community Service and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA), under Minister Patterson, terminated the funding agreement on 7 March 2005. I am advised that this was due to Murawina Mt Druitt Cooperative Ltd breaching it obligations under clause 7.3(b) of the funding agreement by failing to prepare and give the then FaHCSIA an annual financial acquittal report for the 2003-2004 financial year by 30 November 2004, and not rectifying the omission or breach after receiving 14 days notice from the then FaHCSIA to do so.The Official Liquidator for Murawina Mt Druitt Cooperative (in liquidation) owes the Commonwealth monies.Yes. The Commonwealth is a secured creditor in respect of $97, 758 being amounts paid to the liquidator for property preservation costs and is listed as an unsecured creditor for an amount that is still being negotiated.</DOC>

No. The Commonwealth Government does not have routine access to information relating to coronial inquiries of state and territory Coroners' offices. This information may be obtained from individual state and territory Coroners' offices.Since January 2005, the Therapeutic Goods Administration received 32 reports of deaths associated with these medicines, through the Adverse Drug Reactions reporting scheme. However, these data should be interpreted with extreme caution. Reporting is voluntary and the fact that 'death' is recorded as an outcome in the Adverse Drug Reactions database does not indicate a causal link between the medicine and the fatal outcome. Causality assessment is a complex process involving careful consideration of all available evidence on a case-by-case basis.</DOC>

The running costs of Caring for our Country are no higher, and are indeed, similar to the combined running costs of the previous natural resource management programs. There will be some costs related to implementing the new program arrangements but these will be more than offset by the efficiencies gained in streamlining the administrative processes and integrating the previous four natural resource management programs into one program to be delivered through a single program delivery arrangement.The limited amount of stationery and promotional material that is held for the existing natural resource management programs will be used, if possible, or recycled. As it is, existing stocks of stationery and promotional material are meagre because 2007 was the final year for both the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Landcare Program; the Environmental Stewardship Program had not yet begun; and Working on Country has produced limited promotional material as it targets a very specific stakeholder group.</DOC>

The Council of Australian Governments Agenda has already agreed a set of outcomes and reform directions. In schooling they focus on six key areas: (1) improving teacher quality and school leadership; (2) setting high standards and expectations; (3) boosting parental engagement; (4) greater accountability and better directed resources; (5) creating modern world-class learning environments, including in information and communication technologies; and (6) raising attainment levels in low socio-economic status communities.(2 to 3) The 2008-09 Budget measure, Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform, will introduce conditions on the receipt of income support payments whereby parents are obliged to ensure their children of compulsory school age are enrolled in school as well as take reasonable action to ensure children attend school regularly. The measure will initially be implemented in selected locations, including six sites in the NT, namely Hermannsburg, Katherine, Katherine town camps, Wallace Rockhole, Wadeye and Tiwi Islands, and two metropolitan locations outside of the NT. One of these will be in the suburb of Cannington in Perth, Western Australia. The other has yet to be decided.For enrolment, parents will be required to inform Centrelink directly of the school at which their child is enrolled. For attendance, school authorities will be able to notify Centrelink where parents have not taken reasonable action to ensure their children attend school regularly. Centrelink will then notify parents of the consequences for non-compliance. Parents who persist in failing to meet their obligations without a reasonable excuse may have their income support payments suspended until they comply.Before suspension is imposed, Centrelink will actively work with parents to assist them comply with their requirements and to determine whether parents have a reasonable excuse for their incapacity to comply. Once parents demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to ensure their children are attending school, income support payments will be restored with back payment.</DOC>

Under the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act, provision was made to record takeaway alcohol sales in excess of 1350mls of liquor.After its commencement a submission was received from representative bodies for licensees proposing a $100 measure as a clear and concise way for licensees and their staff to comply with their legal obligations under the Act. Prior to the introduction of the $100 threshold, licensees were required to calculate the alcohol content of each liquor item purchased to determine whether or not the 1350mls pure alcohol limit had been exceeded.That case was accepted by the previous Government and the $100 limit was set for recording purposes.The NT Government also collates data on wholesale liquor sales throughout the Northern Territory and this information is published on its web site.YesYes. All NT Licensing inspectors undertake compliance checks to ensure licensed premises are collecting this information in accordance with the requirements of the Act. Checks of the $100 register are a routine part of licensing checks at takeaway premises. From January to 9 May, 68 takeaway premises checks were undertaken (some covert) in Southern Region and 90 takeaway licence inspections in Northern Region. Except for covert checks, these included $100 register data.The Australian Government also provided funding for 8 out of 12 additional Licensing Inspectors in the NT. Six of these positions became effective on 6 January, with a further two remote positions (Tennant Creek and Katherine) commencing in April due to difficulties associated with recruitment to remote localities.The primary objective of the positions is to provide liquor regulatory and compliance services to targeted rural and remote areas, with a particular focus on the prescribed areas of the NTNER Act. In line with the funding agreement, the inspectors are expected to regularly visit NTER prescribed communities.The $100 register data is automatically included in the liquor permit system that operates in East Arnhem land, while a photo identification system operating in the Katherine region and Nhulunbuy is being programmed to produce an automated report on sales of $100 and over.It is hoped that alcohol measures under the NTNER Act 2007 will add to inroads being made in supply reduction through the introduction of Liquor Supply plans. For instance, in Alice Springs there has been a 10.2% reduction in pure alcohol sales in the first 12 months after the plan's introduction on 1 October 2006.Where recorded data indicates purchased alcohol is to be consumed in a prescribed area, such information is utilised to inform any investigations into offences.My Department (FaHCSIA) is also currently working with Police and Licensing to examine the potential for the $100 register data to provide an ongoing basis of intelligence for surveillance in relation to alcohol purchases and potential breaches of the NTNER Act.The $100 measure will be part of the NTER measures looked at under the Review.</DOC>

In November 2006, the assessment report of the Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) titled 'Peritonectomy: Assessment for Nationally Funded Centre Status  -  a report by the Medical Services Advisory Committee to the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council' was completed and provided to the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council (AHMAC) for consideration.This was in response to AHMAC's request of June 2005 for advice from MSAC on the suitability of the technique of peritonectomy for support under the Nationally Funded Centre (NFC) program. The assessment in particular considered the suitability of the peritonectomy service at St George Hospital in Kogarah, NSW, as a potential provider of the service as an NFC.MSAC considered that evidence for the effectiveness of peritonectomy in the treatment of pseudomyxoma and peritoneal mesothelioma was weak, and recommended that one centre undertake research and evaluation to determine the effectiveness of this service in the long term.The report is available on the MSAC website at www.msac.gov.au.Based on advice received from the NFC Reference Group, AHMAC confirmed at its 13 June 2007 meeting that NFC status would not be conferred for this procedure. This decision was conveyed to the St George Hospital in October 2007.Since 1998, the Commonwealth has broadbanded its NFC contributions through the Australian Health Care Agreements (AHCAs). The Commonwealth and the States and Territories are currently working together to develop new national health care agreements. These are expected to be signed by December 2008 and commence in July 2009. Clarification of the respective roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States and Territories is part of this process. Therefore it is not possible to comment on whether a nationally funded centre for peritoneal cancer is likely to be funded at this time.</DOC>

The Welfare to Work Contact Model, in its trial form, ceased operating from 30 June 2008. Participants in the pilot who wish to continue with increased reporting will be given the option to continue.The highest level of participation in the Contact Model was in March 2007 where approximately 95,000 job seekers had been converted from standard reporting to the Contact Model arrangements. Due to a range of factors, including differing target job seeker groups participating in the pilot, employment outcomes varied.Please see answer to question (4).An evaluation of the Contact Model was completed in late 2007. The evaluation compared the difference between outcomes achieved at Contact Model sites with outcomes from similar Centrelink sites that did not operate the Contact Model.The evaluation identified some outcomes from the engagement of job seekers via the Contact Model; the results of the trial produced mixed outcomes.</DOC>

Details of breaches prior to this period are contained in archived paper files and are not readily available. Were Defence to expend the time or the resources required to provide similar data from 1996-2006, this would delay approval of export permission and exports from Australia.Prosecutions for breaches of Regulation 13E of the Customs Act 1901 are undertaken by the Australian Customs Service. Customs has prosecuted two cases for defence-related goods.The first offence took place on 13 February 2003 and the hearing was held on 7 February 2006. The defendants were found guilty and fined $13,000 and the goods forfeited to the Crown.The second offence took place on or about 1 March 2003 and the hearing was held on 30 May 2006. The defendant was found guilty of five charges but successfully appealed four of the five charges.The goods involved in both prosecutions mentioned above were military items.

Cabinet documents are required to be destroyed by vacating ministers' staff in accordance with the provisions of the Protective Security Manual.Yes.I am advised that immediately following the 2007 election, the Cabinet Secretariat wrote to all outgoing ministers and parliamentary secretaries advising that all Cabinet documents were to be destroyed and providing guidance on the appropriate procedures for destroying any hardcopy Cabinet documents. Assurances were also requested to be provided to the Secretariat once destruction had occurred. The Cabinet Secretariat subsequently followed-up with phone calls to all ministers' and parliamentary secretaries' offices. The Cabinet Secretariat received written and/or verbal confirmation from 90 per cent of all outgoing ministers and parliamentary secretaries that they no longer held any documents.I am advised that, to the best of its knowledge, the Cabinet Secretariat is confident that ministers and parliamentary secretaries followed correct procedures and destroyed all Cabinet documents allocated to them.</DOC>

Consultation with industry by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) has identified that most flour mills in Australia will require an upgrade to equipment in order to implement mandatory fortification of flour for making bread with folic acid.Yes.FSANZ is currently consulting with flour millers and fortification experts internationally to further examine the ranges of folic acid in flour being achieved and the equipment and processes used, in order to minimize the impact of this initiative on the flour milling industry.The Australia New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council has also taken steps to address the issues about compliance and enforcement of the folic acid Standard. The Implementation Sub-Committee has established a working group to develop a compliance and enforcement model for folic acid fortification that can be adopted by industry and jurisdictional enforcement agencies.The compliance and enforcement model will consider the compliance of industry with the specified range of folic acid and assist with the implementation of the Standard. FSANZ is currently developing an Industry User Guide to assist industry, expected to be released later in 2008.FSANZ consulted and engaged with industry at all stages in the development of the mandatory folic acid fortification Standard. FSANZ will continue to work with industry to help address the implementation issues around this new Standard.</DOC>

The primary focus of the Bringing Nurses Back into the Workforce program is to address the nursing shortage in our hospitals and there are no plans to expand this into the community setting. Government funding currently provides support for nurses in community settings, including re-entry and education and training programs and scholarships.In addition to the increased services to the hospital system, the Government is investing in strengthening community health services through:a range of commitments such as GP super clinics and support for Nurses in General Practice; andthe development of a National Primary Health Care Strategy to support the community health workforce in the medium term by promoting evidence-based management of chronic disease. This strategy will focus on:supporting patients with chronic disease to manage their condition;supporting the role GPs play in the health care team;addressing the growing need for access to other health professionals including practice nurses and allied health professionals like physiotherapists and dieticians; andencouraging a greater focus on multidisciplinary team-based care.These initiatives will provide support for the community nursing sector.The Australian Government recognises and values the vital work that nurses undertake in every sector of our health care system.I am pleased to advise that Ms Rosemary Bryant was appointed to the position of Commonwealth Chief Nurse and Midwifery Officer (CCNMO) on 22 June 2008. The role of CCNMO was established to build and strengthen nursing leadership nationally and provide a national perspective and strategic, collaborative approach on nursing workforce planning, strategy and education.Nursing education and training is an area of significant investment by the Australian Government, a recognition that reflects the important contribution nurses make to the Australian health care system. The Australian Government has committed funding for an additional 1,170 ongoing university nursing places per year.The Australian Government plans to develop a national maternity services plan to ensure national coordination of maternity services. The first step in developing this plan is to undertake the Maternity Services Review, which will consider a range of issues relevant to the full range of maternity services, including the important role of midwives.The work of the National Health and Hospital Reform Commission (NHHRC) and the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) will inform development of further strategies to build an effective and sustainable workforce for the future.</DOC>

In cases of child neglect, the Western Australian Department for Child Protection will be able to request compulsory income management of parents in receipt of welfare payments in the Kimberley and Cannington areas of Western Australia from September 2008.The Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform measure will commence from the start of the 2009 school year. Income management or 'quarantining of payments' will not be used as part of this measure. The Government proposes to legislate to provide for income support payments to be temporarily suspended until parents make adequate effort to enrol their children in school and ensure they attend.Operation of the Cape York measure will commence early in the 2008/09 financial year, subject to the finalisation of details with the Queensland government.Under the Cape York measure individuals may approach the Families Responsibilities Commission to be voluntarily income managed. These referrals may be made from the commencement of this measure.Voluntary Income Management is expected to be activated in conjunction with the Child Protection measure in the Kimberley and Cannington areas of Western Australia only.</DOC>

Aurora Australis will conduct the annual logistic resupply of the Japanese Antarctic station Syowa and in transit, will conduct some marine science on behalf of the Japanese Institute of Polar Research.The conduct of marine science on this voyage will not compromise the integrity of Australia's efforts to protect whales. No whaling related research will be conducted during the voyage. The Japanese Institute of Polar Research is unrelated to the Institute for Cetacean Research (that conducts Japan's whaling operations), and the research that is being conducted accords with Australia's own Antarctic research efforts.</DOC>

The Australian Government has sought clarification from authorities in Indonesia concerning recent reports of changes to Indonesia's policy on public announcement of human cases of H5N1 avian influenza.  The Government understands that Indonesia has continued to report cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) since the reported policy change.The WHO is the appropriate body to provide comment on compliance with the International Health Regulations.  WHO Assistant Director-General David Heymann has stated that Indonesia has told WHO that it will continue to report avian influenza cases in accordance with the International Health Regulations.The Australian Government has sought clarification on this issue from Indonesian authorities.</DOC>

There is no protocol, agreement or arrangement between the Australian and United States governments that governs the operations of the United States Secret Service personnel who accompany the United States President, Vice President and/or Cabinet members during visits to Australia.The Australian Government has a longstanding policy of not permitting the importation and carriage of weapons by foreign security personnel. Foreign governments may formally seek exemptions to this policy, and the Australian Government considers any such request on a case by case basis. Consistently with this policy, specific security arrangements are not discussed publicly.There are no specific arrangements in place concerning civil and criminal liability in relation to actions by United States Secret Service agents in Australia.

No. Defence has been unable to substantiate this purpose due to the unavailability of records for that period. The site on Allara Street was empty prior to the commencement of construction of the depot in the late 1960s.  The depot was purpose built for the Army Reserve, specifically the 3rd Battalion, The Royal New South Wales Regiment and the Australian National University Company of the Sydney University Regiment.  There were no other users of this site between 1968 and 1972.</DOC>

This question is best directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, I am advised that at the time the Government became aware of Mr Habib's possible detention in Pakistan in early October 2001, representations were made on a number of occasions to Pakistani officials in Islamabad, seeking confirmation of Mr Habib's detention and seeking consular access. Consular access was denied by Pakistan. Notwithstanding that the Australian Government formed a view in mid to late November that Mr Habib was most likely in Egypt, the Australian Embassy continued to make representations to Pakistani officials seeking information on Mr Habib until mid January 2002. (b) This question is best directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, I am advised that the Department became aware in November 2001 that Mr Habib was no longer in Pakistan and that he may have been transferred to Egypt. Between November 2001 and April 2002, the Australian Embassy in Cairo made representations to the Egyptian Government on a number of occasions, including at the highest levels, seeking confirmation of Mr Habib's detention in Egypt and seeking consular access to him. However, the Government of Egypt has never officially confirmed that it held Mr Habib in its custody.. (c) I am advised that Australian authorities were notified on 16 April 2002 that Mr Habib was in United States custody.Yes. As stated in response to question number 196 taken on notice by ASIO during an Estimates hearing of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee on 15 February 2005:'ASIO received notification on 6 October 2001 that an Australian man had been taken into custody by Pakistani authorities. On 8 October 2001 it was confirmed that the man was Mamdouh Habib.'Yes. I am advised that upon notification of Mr Habib's apprehension in Pakistan, the AFP commenced an investigation with a view to determining whether Mr Habib had breached any Australian laws. As with all investigations, the AFP communicated with relevant partner agencies as required. I am advised that ASIO had discussions with Pakistani officials concerning Mr Habib on a number of occasions from around late October 2001. It is not appropriate to comment further.Yes. I am advised that Mr Habib was interviewed by ASIO on 24 October 2001 and by ASIO and AFP officers on 26 and 29 October 2001.Please see answer to question 3.I am advised that the Department has no record of how it became aware that Mr Habib may have been in Egypt.The former Director-General of ASIO, in testimony before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee on 15 February 2005, said:'We formed a view in mid to late November that he (Mr Habib) was most likely in Egypt, and that was the basis of the Foreign Affairs' representation to the Egyptian authorities for consular        access to him. We established to our satisfaction that he was definitely there in February 2002.'The AFP has previously stated, in response to question 232 taken on notice  during an Estimates hearing of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee on 15 February 2005 that:'The AFP became aware on 19 November that Mr Habib was no longer in Pakistan and was most likely to be in Egypt.'However, the Government of Egypt has never officially confirmed that it held Mr Habib in its custody, despite numerous representations by the Australian Government, including at the highest levels.I am advised that the Australian Government made representations to the Egyptian Government on a number of occasions to seek confirmation of Mr Habib's detention and seek access to him. Mr Habib's detention was never confirmed and therefore no Australian government officer had contact with Mr Habib in Egypt.The Australian Government made representations to the Egyptian Government on a number of occasions to seek confirmation of Mr Habib's detention and seek access to him. Mr Habib's detention was never confirmed.Please see answer to question 8.I am advised that no explanation was given.I am advised that the Department was not involved in making specific inquiries in respect of allegations that Mr Habib was subjected to torture or inhumane treatment while he was detained abroad. I note that the welfare of Australian citizens abroad is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as part of its consular assistance role. I therefore refer you to the response provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to question 169 addressed to him in writing by you on 25 June 2008. The Minister's response is as follows:'I am advised that the Australian officials who visited Mr Habib on 24, 26 and 29 October 2001 reported that they saw no evidence to indicate he was maltreated. In light of the allegations made by Mr Habib on television on 13 February 2005, the Department requested the Australian Embassy in Islamabad to make representations to the Pakistani Government to investigate Mr Habib's claims. In response, Pakistani authorities advised that an investigation into allegations of mistreatment of Mr Habib had been completed and no evidence of torture or humiliation had been found.I am advised that in light of the allegations made by Mr Habib on television on 13 February 2005, the Department requested the Australian Embassy in Cairo to make representations to the Egyptian Government to investigate Mr Habib's claims. In response, Egyptian authorities reiterated earlier advice that no evidence had been found of Mr Habib's alleged detention and torture in Egypt.I am advised that at the request of the Australian Government, there have been two investigations into Mr Habib's treatment while in US custody. On 23 August 2004, the United States Department of Defense advised Australia's Ambassador to the United States that an examination of medical records and other documents concerning the detention of Mr Habib had revealed no information to support the allegations of abuse. Similarly, on 15 July 2005, US authorities advised Australia's ambassador to the United States that the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) had undertaken a separate and comprehensive investigation into the allegations that Mr Habib had been abused. The NCIS advised that it undertook an exhaustive review of all records found pertaining to the detention of Mr Habib, and that Navy investigators interviewed Department of Defense, military and medical personnel, other United States Government personnel, federal law enforcement personnel and other detainees. The NCIS investigation found no information to substantiate or corroborate the allegations of abuse. These findings are consistent with reports by Australian officials who regularly visited Mr Habib at Guantanamo Bay. Australian officials visited Mr Habib on 11 occasions in Guantanamo Bay. On each occasion, his welfare was assessed. No evidence of maltreatment or abuse was found.The Department also inquired about the US Department of Justice report released in May 2008 which in part referred to the conditions of Mr Habib's interrogation at Guantanamo Bay in 2004. The Department is seeking from US authorities further details of these incidents and clarification of this report.'</DOC>

and (2) I am advised that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade became aware, through law enforcement and security channels, of the possible detention of Mr Habib by Pakistani authorities in early October 2001. The Australian Embassy in Islamabad made representations on a number of occasions to Pakistani officials seeking confirmation of Mr Habib's detention and consular access to him. Consular access was denied by Pakistan. Australian security officials, however, visited Mr Habib on 24, 26 and 29 October 2001 in Pakistan. Australian law enforcement officials were also present at the meetings of 26 and 29 October 2001.and (4) I am advised that the Department has no record of how it became aware that Mr Habib may have been in Egypt.

Any act by a public official (or other person acting in an official capacity) specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering for particular purposes is torture under international law. Australian agencies do not practise extended sleep deprivation, exposure to extreme cold for extended periods or immobilising a person and pouring water on his or her face to simulate drowning, and the Australian Government does not condone these practices.The use of such techniques has been the subject of media and other speculation for some time. The Government is aware of public statements by United States Government officials relating to the use of various interrogation techniques.I am advised that it is not possible to specify exactly when the Attorney-General's Department or portfolio agencies first became aware of the United States Government's practice of  'extraordinary rendition' of persons suspected of terrorist activities. I am advised that the Department is aware of a United States State Department report 'Patterns of Global Terrorism' 1998 which refers to the extradition and rendition of terrorists to the United States,</DOC>

Yes, I visited the site on 3 March 2008.This question should be directed to the Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government.During my visit to Gympie, Kandanga, the site of the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam and environs on 3 March 2008 I met with representatives from a number of groups who oppose the proposed dam. Consistent with the requirements of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, I will ensure that I have all the information I need before me to make a fully informed decision, including both the public comments in response to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement ('EIS') and the response of the proponent to those comments.During the visit to the project site a light afternoon tea was provided by Queensland Water Infrastructure, proponents of Traveston Crossing Dam. The representatives of the community groups also provided refreshments for my staff and I during our meeting later that afternoon.I do not agree that my acceptance of light refreshments, whether provided by the proponent or the community groups, will create the perception suggested in the question. My decision on the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam will be evidence-based and according to law.</DOC>

I am aware that the Queensland Treasurer, Mr Andrew Fraser, on 13 May 2008, referred to a $500 million investment for the proposed Traveston Crossing Dam. This was in relation to a question without notice from a Queensland Opposition Member of Parliament regarding the Queensland Opposition's plan to climate proof south-east Queensland's water supplies, including scrapping the Traveston Crossing Dam proposal.The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was received by my Department on 18 October 2007, and was subsequently open for public comments until 14 January 2008. The Supplementary Report to the EIS, which will take the public comments into account, is still being finalised by the proponent. My decision-making role under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 commences upon receipt of the Queensland Coordinator-General's Assessment Report which follows the finalisation of the Supplementary Report.The EPBC Act precludes the commencement of an action before the assessment process is complete and a decision made on the proposal.Construction of the Traveston Crossing Dam has not commenced. I am aware that various investigative geotechnical and other works have been undertaken by the proponent to inform the environmental impact assessment process and other design related aspects of the proposal. My Department was notified of these activities, however such works are not considered part of the action referred for the purposes of assessment and approval under the EPBC Act, which is the construction and operation of the Traveston Crossing Dam. Accordingly, the question of halting the project until it is appropriate to proceed does not arise.</DOC>

The Australian Government appreciates that the broadcasting industry is facing a new, digital era. The digital environment is a complex one and the transition of television from the analog to the digital environment presents a number of challenges, one being the retransmission 'black spot' sites across Australia.The Government is currently examining options for maximising viewer access to digital television services where the signals provided by broadcasters prove to be deficient.The costs and technical aspects of conversion are also being investigated and the Government will consider all facets, including any possible assistance programs, in the decision making process.On 18 December 2007, the Minister announced the establishment of the Digital Switchover Taskforce, which will oversee the major tasks, processes and timeframes necessary to drive digital television take-up and achieve digital switchover throughout Australia by 31 December 2013.Information in relation to the switchover timetable and related issues, such as the conversion of 'black spot' television transmitters to digital, will be made available publicly once all issues and factors have been addressed as outlined above to ensure a smooth transition from analog to a digital environment for viewers.</DOC>

The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations periodically conducts net impact studies to complement the performance data it reports through other mechanisms, such as the Star Ratings and Labour Market Assistance Outcomes reports. The most recent publicly available study, A Net Impact Study of Job Network Programmes and Work for the Dole 2006, was published in April 2006.Net impacts can be measured in terms of both employment and off-benefit outcomes. Employment net impacts, as in Table 1 below, measure the proportion of job seekers who were in employment following their participation in assistance compared to a control group of similar job seekers who were not assisted through the program, the difference in outcomes achieved being the net impacts of the various types of assistance. The off-benefit net impacts (also see Table 1) use the same methodology, and assess movements off activity-tested (that is Newstart Allowance and Youth Allowance (other)) income support types. For the 2006 study, the net impacts at the three month point were not assessed. The employment net impacts were assessed twelve months after commencement in assistance. The off-benefit net impacts were measured six and twelve months after commencement in assistance.

South Road between Sir Donald Bradman Drive and the entrance to the Southern Expressway is not on the AusLink National Network as declared under Part 2 of the AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005. The Government will add this section of road to the National Network in accordance with its election commitment., (4) and (5) Specific funding arrangements for the Australian Government's land transport investment program for 2009 - 10 to 2013 - 14 are the subject of negotiations between the Australian Government and state and territory governments. However, the Government provided $12.6 million in 2008 - 09 to start planning on the South Road upgrade, as part of our $500 million commitment to this project.</DOC>

The 2008-09 Budget measure, Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform, will introduce conditions on the receipt of income support payments whereby parents are obliged to ensure their children of compulsory school age are enrolled in school as well as take reasonable action to ensure children attend school regularly. The measure will initially be implemented in selected locations, including six sites in the NT, namely Hermannsburg, Katherine, Katherine town camps, Wallace Rockhole, Wadeye and Tiwi Islands, and two metropolitan locations outside of the NT. One of these is Cannington WA and the other is being finalised.For enrolment, parents will be required to inform Centrelink directly of the school at which their child is enrolled. For attendance, state school authorities will be able to notify Centrelink where parents have not taken reasonable action to ensure their children attend school regularly. Centrelink will then notify parents of the consequences for non-compliance. Parents who persist in failing to meet their obligations without a reasonable excuse may have their income support payments suspended until they comply.Before suspension is imposed, Centrelink will actively work with parents to assist them comply with their requirements and to determine whether parents have a reasonable excuse for their incapacity to comply. Once parents demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to ensure their children are attending school, income support payments will be restored with back payment.As part of its commitment to improve child welfare the Commonwealth Government is developing a National Child Protection Framework which will include practical measures such as quarantining welfare payments in cases of child neglect to ensure they are spent in the best interests of children. As part of the Framework, the Government will progressively enable state and territory child welfare authorities to notify Centrelink to income manage parents' income support and family assistance payments where this will help ensure payments are used to benefit children rather than fuel harmful behaviours.Under income management part of a person's income support and family payments are managed through Centrelink to ensure that income is directed towards priority needs including food, clothing, housing education and medical expenses.The Commonwealth and Western Australian Governments are working in partnership to implement the early roll out of the Child Protection measure in that state from July 2008. The initial roll out will take place in selected areas, the Kimberley region of northern WA and the Cannington District in metropolitan Perth.Both the Australian and WA Governments recognise the importance of this measure and are sensitive of their responsibility to ensure that the approach taken in implementation is right, with the relevant support systems in place and tested appropriately.</DOC>

At the end of May 2008, there were around 85,000 Family tax Benefit recipients who were paid fortnightly who also had a reportable fringe benefit . Around 4,200 of these recipients had an adjustable taxable income of less then $40,000.The number of Family Tax Benefit recipients who are employees of charitable organisations is not known. Centrelink does not collect information on a person's type of employment as it is not necessary for assessing their eligibility for Family Tax Benefit.In the 2005-06 tax year, around 100,000 employees in the not-for-profit sector received some portion of their remuneration in the form of fringe benefit. That number is about one-seventh of the total population receiving fringe benefits. Its is only the number of those employees who have children and receive Family Tax Benefit who would have affected by a change to the treatment of reportable fringe benefits.This information is not publicly available and falls outside the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs portfolio responsibility.The Government's 2008-09 Budget did not change the treatment of reportable fringe benefits in determining income for Family Tax Benefit purposes. The change in the treatment of reportable fringe benefits was announced as part of the previous Government's Child Support Reforms and was included in the 2006-07 Budget.On 19 June 2008, the Government announced its decision to reverse those changes so that employees in the charitable and not-for-profit sector will not suffer a loss of family tax or child care benefits after 1 July 2008 if their circumstances have not otherwise changed. Legislation has been passed by the Parliament to restore the use of the net value of reportable fringe benefits in the income definition for family assistance from 1 July 2008.The treatment of fringe benefits is a complex issue, with flow on effects to employees beyond the not-for-profit sector receiving family assistance. The broader policy issues will be considered as part of the comprehensive review of Australia's Future Tax System being led by Treasury Secretary, Dr Ken Henry.</DOC>

Yes.The Australian and Western Australian Governments are working in partnership to implement income management in selected areas of Western Australia, including the Kimberley area and the Cannington region in Perth. From September 2008, the Western Australian Department for Child Protection will be able to notify Centrelink to apply income management where it has been assessed that children are being neglected and where poor use of available financial resources wholly or partially contributes to that neglect.In addition, the Governments have committed to implementing a trial in the Cannington region in Perth linking school enrolment and attendance with welfare payments. Parents receiving income support will be required to inform Centrelink of where their children are enrolled and to take reasonable measures to ensure their children attend school regularly. Parents who fail to enrol their child or take reasonable measures to get their children to school may have their income support payments suspended until the problem is resolved. If parents have met their responsibilities within a 13 week period, full back pay of their suspended payments will be provided. This initiative will also be trialled in six communities in the Northern Territory and an additional metropolitan site which will be announced in the future.In comparison to Indigenous people in remote areas, those in urban areas have much greater access to programs and services.The Government is committed to closing the gap between Indigenous and non Indigenous Australians regardless of where they live. We are working with the States and Territories to develop new approaches and to ensure that non-remote Indigenous people benefit from services designed for all Australians. As part of the reform of Specific Purpose Payments we will leverage better outcomes for Indigenous people in remote, regional and urban areas.</DOC>

and (2) The Australian Government is working with the States and Territories to determine how best to partner to deliver the 260 centres on the ground. In some cases, the relevant State may choose to provide the land, such as a school site, and manage the construction process, in which case the Australian Government will partner with the State for the delivery of that centre. In some cases, Local Government may also contribute. In other cases, including where the Australian Government is partnering with the relevant State, non-government partners will be sought via a competitive process.Selection criteria relating to the other Early Learning and Care Centres have not been finalised. For probity reasons all information relating to a tender process must be made available to all potential applicants at the same time. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to provide the details of specific criteria ahead of any future tender process.The Australian Government has traditionally delivered a wide range of programs offering support for the establishment and ongoing sustainability of child care services to address areas of market failure.</DOC>

The Traveston Crossing Dam proposal is being assessed in accordance with the bilateral agreement between the Australian and Queensland Governments. Assessments are conducted pursuant to this agreement to reduce duplication between state and federal assessment processes. All assessments must meet the standards outlined in the agreement, relevant Queensland legislation and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The decision-making processes under the EPBC Act are fully independent and following the receipt of the assessment report from Queensland I can request any additional information that I require.Consistent with the requirements of the EPBC Act, I will ensure that I have all the information I need before me to make a fully informed decision. My Department has commissioned a number of independent experts to review the hydrological modelling and the impacts on threatened species such as the Australian Lungfish and Mary River Turtle. In addition to those reports my decision will also be informed by relevant information from a wide range of sources, including public comments on the draft Environmental Impact Statement and the response of the proponent to those comments.</DOC>

$7.5 million is available for the Environmental Stewardship Program in 2008-09.No. Proposals for 2008-09 have been received and are currently being assessed.The breakdown of funding for each of the regional natural resource management or catchment management bodies in (a) 2007-08; and (b) 2008-09 is in Table 1 below.The Australian Government does not directly employ Landcare and Natural Resource Managers or staff at natural resource management bodies through Caring for our Country. The Government therefore does not have access to specific data on the number of people employed as (a) Landcare and Natural Resource Managers; and (b) staff at regional natural resource or catchment management bodies. The Australian Government has, however, carried out a survey on the number of full time equivalent positions employed by all regional Natural Resource Management bodies in response to a request by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. The survey data showed that on 20 November 2007 a total of 1,891.32 full time equivalent positions were employed and on 7 May 2008 a total of 1,882.58 full time equivalent positions were employed. This information was provided by state and regional organisations and cannot be verified by the Australian Government.The Australian Government is not the only source of funds used to employ Landcare and Natural Resource Managers and staff at regional natural resource or catchment management bodies and variations in employment numbers is a combination of a range of factors including variations in funding from all sources.As at 8 September 2008 the total amount expended on Caring for our Country advertising, including the Working on Country program, Open Grants, Community Coastcare, National Reserve System and the Environmental Stewardship Program, is $173,799.44. This includes 225 radio spot advertisements placed across the country and 60 advertisements in the print media in several national, regional and indigenous newspapers. Advertisements were placed in all capital city and major rural newspapers in all states and territories and the following towns specifically for the Environmental Stewardship Program target area: Blayney, Wagga Wagga, Boorowa, Cootamundra, Cowra, Crookwell, Forbes, Goulburn, Grenfell, Molong, Hay, Orange, Temora, West Wyalong, Yass, Young, Bungendore, Gundagai, Harden, Narrandera, Braidwood, Cooma, Condobolin, Parkes, Nyngan, Griffith, Junee, Queanbeyan, Leeton, Tumut, Orange.

The Improving School Enrolment and Attendance through Welfare Reform Measure will be trialled in six locations in the Northern Territory  -  Hermannsburg, Wallace Rockhole, Katherine, Katherine Town Camps, Wadeye and Tiwi Islands. In addition, there are two metropolitan locations, one in the Cannington area of Western Australia and one other yet to be announced.It is intended that from the first term of 2009 all parents receiving income support within the selected locations will be required to provide details of their child's school enrolment to Centrelink. Parents who are doing the right thing and have their children enrolled in school will not need to do anything further. Parents who fail to provide enrolment information to Centrelink without a reasonable excuse will have their income support payments temporarily suspended. As soon as these parents enrol their child or provide enrolment information their payments will be reinstated with back pay, if the requirement is met within a 13 week time period.Parents receiving income support will also be expected to take reasonable steps to ensure their children are regularly attending school. In instances where a child is not attending regularly, the relevant state, territory or independent education authority can inform Centrelink. Parents will be required to show they are working with the school and their child to try to improve the child's school attendance. If they cannot demonstrate this, they may have their income support payments temporarily suspended until action is taken. However suspension is not the first step; it is the last step. Families will be offered support from schools and from Centrelink social workers before any consideration is given to suspension. It is important to note that where a child has unsatisfactory school attendance despite the best efforts of their parents no penalty will be imposed on parents.Consistent with their current responsibilities, education authorities/schools determine which children are not attending regularly. Under the measure, education authorities/schools may choose to inform Centrelink of those parents in receipt of income support whose children are not attending regularly and who may benefit from a Centrelink intervention. Education authorities/schools will subsequently determine whether there has been a satisfactory improvement in attendance. Guidelines for determining reasonable action by parents to ensure their children attend school will be negotiated between the Commonwealth and state education authorities/non-government schools in the formulation of bilateral agreements.Implementation of the measure has commenced and includes development of the legislation, system changes, an evaluation methodology and policy documentation. Parents living in trial locations will not be subject to the measure until the beginning of the 2009 school year.</DOC>

Under their existing funding arrangements with the Department, Industry Skills Councils are required to provide an Environmental Scan to the National Quality Council once every 12 months.The Environmental Scan provides information about skill shortages and training gaps based on the day-to-day interaction of the Industry Skills Councils with employers, unions, regulators and other stakeholders in their industry sectors. The Scan also provides a stocktake of physical changes made to the endorsed components of Training Packages over the preceding 12 months to reflect industry's emerging needs and address identified skill shortages and gaps.Over the next three years, Industry Skills Councils will be resourced by the Commonwealth to work with enterprises to identify their skill needs and appropriate training solutions. Information gathered through this role will see the Environmental Scans become increasingly rich with real-time data to gauge the magnitude of issues, and in doing so, become a valuable direction-setting document for the national training system.</DOC>

Yes, there were some changes to staffing arrangements in my Department's Perth Office in the past 12 months. Some functions necessitated an increase in staff, others a decrease. Overall there has been a decrease in the number of staff in WA over the past 12 months.There has been an increase in the number of staff in the Perth office assigned to deal with over the counter enquiries.Quality of service remains of the utmost importance and priority to my Department. The reduction in overall staffing has resulted from a process of national reorganisation to make the best use of available resources. This process of consolidation commenced almost two years ago and continues under this Government. These changes will not impact on clients or the levels of service they currently receive.My priority is the quality of service my Department provides to the veteran community and its ongoing commitment to meet the service standards articulated in its service charter. A copy of my Department's Service Charter is available on the Department's internet site at www.dva.gov.au/media/publicat/2006/service_charter/index.htm.</DOC>

Staff from the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) and the ADF are currently participating in an overseas study tour as part of the course curriculum of the Executive Masters in Complex Project Management.The tour departed on Friday 19 September 2008 and is scheduled to return on Sunday 5 October 2008.Defence staff comprises 14 civilians from the DMO and two ADF (Army) members.Students will travel to the UK and USA visiting; the London Olympic Delivery Authority and Olympic Site;Mary McKinley, Vice President of the International Project Management Association;Michael Jackson, British Systems Scientist and Professor of Management Systems;BAE Systems Submarine Solutions (Astute Project);National Defence University Industrial College of the Armed Forces; Micron Technology Inc; andThe Joint Strike Fighter project at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company.$3,726 per person.Estimated at $3,948 per person.Estimated at $910 per person.The study tour is a requisite component of the Masters course and counts towards one full unit of study. Students of the Queensland University of Technology are required to participate in the activity to ensure that they meet the university's requirements to graduate with this degree. The study tour will consolidate learning from the first half of the course and form the basis of several critical pieces of assessment on their return.The study tour forms a critical component of a broader learning strategy to incorporate a strong practical and experiential element within the program. 'Implementation of Complex Projects' is an important unit of study on the program, putting into practice the academic theory that students have studied to date. To fully appreciate the challenges and complexities of project management at this level, it is essential that students directly engage with international project managers of these complex projects. This will enable them to understand and appreciate the strategies (successful or otherwise) these individuals implement in managing these projects.As the majority of Defence's most complex projects form part of a global supply chain it is important for our future project managers to appreciate the challenges this presents in addition to developing an understanding of how these challenges might best be managed in an environment characterised by uncertainty and high levels of scrutiny. Experiential learning in this style is an essential element to successful adult learning and development and has been proven to enhance knowledge retention and subsequent successful application.The Masters course has been developed with the Competency Standard for Complex Project Managers as the underpinning knowledge of the course content. View 8 of the Standard refers to 'Culture and Being Human' and is based around the importance of Complex Project Managers having a sound appreciation of the cultural nuances that can impact international projects. Experiencing this first hand on the study tour fulfils the requirement that students be exposed to this as part of their ongoing understanding of the underpinning knowledge in the Standard.No.</DOC>

This represents 0.2 per cent of the 13 253 current DEN uncapped clients at that date.94.6 per cent of the workers who entered the DEN capped stream between 01/01/06 and 31/12/06 with their employment in jeopardy, retained their employment for at least six months. It is not possible to provide comparable information for the DEN uncapped stream, due to the small number of employment in jeopardy clients who had entered the program by the end of December 2007.</DOC>

This work forms a consistent basis for decisions about skill shortages across geographic areas, and the methodology has been assessed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as being appropriate for its purpose.The setting of future priorities for the Productivity Places Program is currently being considered by Skills Australia, in consultation with industry through Industry Skills Councils, which now have an expanded role in providing advice on skills and training needs of business.</DOC>

The Government has established Infrastructure Australia (IA), an independent statutory advisory council, to provide advice to the Australian Government about infrastructure gaps and bottlenecks that hinder economic growth and prosperity. IA will also identify investment priorities, and propose policy and regulatory reforms necessary to deliver timely and coordinated national infrastructure investment or improve the efficient utilisation of existing infrastructure.To meet its goal of facilitating public discussion about how the planning, investment in and use of nationally significant infrastructure can be improved, IA has called for submissions from industry and the community. As part of this process, IA has released two discussion papers on Australia's Future Requirements and on Public Private Partnerships. The papers are available on the IA website &lt;www.infrastructureaustralia.gov.au&gt;. Submissions are due to Infrastructure Australia no later than 15 October 2008, for consideration in the development of the National Public Private Partnership Guidelines and National Infrastructure Audit.I would encourage you and your constituents to make submissions as part of this process.</DOC>

The Northern Territory Government is eligible to claim Wage Assistance for former CDEP participants who are employed either on an ongoing full-time or part-time (of at least 15 hours per week) basis under a normal employer-employee relationship.Wage Assistance is not payable where the placement is supported by another Commonwealth, State or Territory wage subsidy program. However, where a placement is funded under the Structured Training and Employment Projects (STEP) program, Wage Assistance can be claimed by an employer where the STEP agreement does not have a wage subsidy component.The information provided refers to the current Indigenous Employment Program.

The Corporations Act 2001 regulates companies operating in Australia to protect the integrity of the market, facilitate commerce and industry, and maintain investor confidence.  Australia's corporate governance framework, including the rules on shareholder engagement and participation, is well regarded internationally.The Corporations Act 2001 contains a range of duties setting out certain minimum obligations and responsibilities that directors of Australian companies must fulfil.  Directors face penalties of $200,000 for civil contraventions of these provisions, and can be disqualified from managing corporations.  Criminal contraventions face maximum fines of $220,000, or imprisonment for 5 years, or both.Through Chapter 5C of the Corporations Act 2001 regulation is also in place to protect investors in managed investment schemes such as the Wellington Premium Income Fund (PIF) (formerly known as the Octaviar Premium Income Fund).  The PIF was required to be registered with ASIC in accordance with Part 5C.1.  To obtain registration, the PIF was required to have: a responsible entity (RE) that was a public company holding an Australian financial services licence authorising it to operate the scheme (Part 5C.2); a legally binding constitution compliant with Part 5C.3; and a compliance plan dealing with matters prescribed in Part 5C.4.  Members of the PIF have the right to: remove and replace the responsible entity; veto certain financial benefits to the RE or related parties out of scheme property; and direct the responsible entity to wind up the scheme.  Members who suffer loss or damage as a result of a contravention of the Corporations Act 2001 by the RE, or its agents, may bring a civil action against the RE.Under the terms of Part 7.9 of the Corporations Act 2001, information concerning the PIF was required to be disclosed to all investors in a product disclosure statement.</DOC>

to (d) - A series of round tables are currently being held in states and territories associated with the mid term evaluation of the National Action Plan to Build on Social Cohesion, Harmony and Security (NAP). The budget for these consultations is $10,000 and they will be completed by June 2009.Research activities currently being scoped for 2008-09 have a budget of $500,000. Most will be completed in the next twelve months.

and (2) The Government's preferred approach outlined in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Green Paper is that owners of eligible Australian forests who opt into the scheme would be able to generate carbon pollution permits. One permit would be issued for every tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestered. Permits could then be sold to liable entities to help meet their scheme obligations or to parties outside the scheme who wish to voluntarily surrender the permits.The Government is currently consulting with stakeholders on design details for coverage of reforestation under the Scheme. The Government will outline its decisions on scheme design in a White Paper to be released in late 2008.Forest owners that opt into the scheme would receive permits for net sequestration that is counted towards Australia's international climate change commitments. Forest owners would also be required to surrender permits for net emissions from the forest, should emissions exceed sequestration. Under this approach the financial benefits for forest owners will be dependent on factors including forestry activity type, changes in the carbon price and final scheme design details.and (6) To be included under the scheme a forest must be established after 1 January 1990 on previously cleared land as defined for the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Scheme permits will only be issued for sequestration that occurs after scheme commencement.The Government's preferred position is that the scheme would be designed to link with international markets and schemes, with restrictions only introduced to ensure 1) the stability and ongoing credibility of the scheme; 2) the environmental integrity and effectiveness of the scheme; and 3) the scheme's consistency with international objectives and obligations. In relation to emission reductions from international forestry projects the Government proposes that at this time the scheme only accept 'removal units' issued by another Kyoto party.The Australian Government's voluntary Greenhouse Friendly initiative currently approves abatement projects, including forestry offsets. The rules applying to carbon sequestered in forests under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will not be the same as those that apply under Greenhouse Friendly.The Government's preferred position is that the scheme regulator issue only one type of domestic permit, referred to as a carbon pollution permit. Permits issued for reforestation will be the same as the permits held by other scheme participants. Each permit will have a unique identification number.The Government's preferred position in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Green Paper is that up to around 30 per cent of Australian carbon pollution permits would be freely allocated to emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) activities. At the outset of the scheme, agricultural emissions are proposed to be excluded from scheme coverage.This would mean that free allocation at the beginning of the scheme would require up to around 20 per cent of total permits inclusive of any emissions.The Government has not proposed separate allocations to individual groups but eligibility for EITE assistance will be determined by the emission intensity of an activity rather than the industry.The proposed 30 per cent of freely allocated permits is to be applied to the economy as a whole. It is not proposed that this is divided on an industry basis.Final discussions on the EITE thresholds and the rates of assistance will be based on further information provided through the Green Paper consultation process to ensure that the total quantum of assistance is limited to around 30 per cent of permits (inclusive of agricultural emissions). This is to ensure an equitable scheme by:sharing the burden of any emissions reduction effort between EITE industries and other areas of the economy; andreflecting the need to use scheme revenue to assist households and other businesses.Eligibility for EITE assistance is proposed to be based on the industry-wide emission intensity of an activity or process being above a threshold of about 1,500 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 e) per million dollars of revenue.Initial assistance is proposed to cover around 90 per cent of emissions for EITE activities that have emissions intensities above 2,000 tonnes CO2 e per million dollars of revenue and around 60 per cent of emissions for EITE activities that have emissions intensities between 1,500 and 2,000 tonnes CO2 e per million dollars of revenue.</DOC>

Accurate participation numbers are calculated through the acquittal forms collected at the completion of each term. At this stage only data for the conclusion of Term 1 2008 is available. During Term 1 2008, 148 898 children participated within the Active After - schools Communities (AASC) program, averaging 47 children per site. As there are 3 192 sites participating in Term 3 2008, it is anticipated that 150 000 children would participate during Term 3 2008.There are over 3,000 Schools &amp; Outside School Hours Care services (OSCHCS) that participate in the Active After Schools Program. A list of the number of Schools &amp; OSHCS by electorate participating during Term 3 2008 is at the end of this answer.See answer to (b).In Term 4 2008, there are currently 3 150 sites accepted within the program. This leaves a vacancy of 100 sites nationally. This number fluctuates regularly, particularly at the end of the year, as sites review their commitment to the program and/or have any change of staff/ownership.and (ii) See the summary table at the end of this answer for a list of the number of Schools and OSHCS within the AASC program and also on the pending list.2008 Selection of Sites:All schools and OSHCS participating within the program during Term 3 2007, were invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) for their involvement in 2008. These forms were collated and assessed against the program criteria, and where schools/OSHCS met the criteria were offered a place in 2008. Only those schools/OSHCS that returned an EOI were considered for involvement in 2008.After the completion of this first round of EOIs, vacancies were then identified within the various regions. Invitations were then sent out to every school and OSHCS within each region that had a vacancy. All EOIs submitted during this stage were equally assessed against one another, and the successful sites notified of their selection. All other sites were placed on a pending list.2009 Selection of Sites:Postcards have been sent to every primary school and Child Care Benefit approved out of school hours care service nationwide, inviting them to express interest in participating in the program in 2009. The database of mailing details was supplied by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.All schools and OSHCS currently participating within the program are guaranteed places in 2009, should they wish to continue their involvement. They are required to indicate their intent by notifying their respective Regional Coordinator, prior to the relevant closing date within their state. They are not required to resubmit a full EOI.Any site currently on the pending list, has been contacted and requested to confirm their intent to be considered for vacancies that may arise during 2009.All new expressions of interest received, will be equally assessed against those sites on the pending list, to fill vacancies within the respective regions.

TILA funding in 2008-09 year remained unchanged from the previous year at $2.56 million.The total number of young people who were assisted by the TILA program in 2007-08 year was 1,504.The funding of a single national TILA provider is expected to increase the take-up rate for the Allowance. In line with the terms of their funding agreement, the contracted service provider is required to promote the program widely and develop an enhanced data collection system. Since signing the contract in 2007, Southern Youth &amp; Family Services has already introduced a number of improvements, including:working with key stakeholders to increase awareness and proper use of the program;developing a website advertising the program (www.tila.org.au); andstreamlining the approval processes (including modifications to the application form).</DOC>

Yes, I am seeking to identify opportunities for better integration of policy and program settings across the Government.Yes, I am seeking to monitor the impact of these policies and programs on young people.We have established the Australian Government Office for Youth (the Office) as a dedicated unit within the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) that reports to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon Julia Gillard MP and me.The Office has commenced work on scoping, negotiating and establishing formal processes to monitor the impact of Australian Government policies and programs on young people. To ensure the Government's investment in young people is evidence-based, strategic, coherent and effective, the Office will identify areas and interventions the evidence indicates will deliver the greatest results.  Evidence and research will be sourced from various academic institutions and government agencies including, for example, the Australian Clearing House for Youth Studies, Australian Bureau of Statistics, and National Youth Affairs Research Scheme.Formal processes to support the work that the Office will undertake across the whole of government on youth issues and policy development will be determined on a case by case basis. The Office has already worked and will continue to work closely with those agencies with the greatest involvement in youth affairs for example the Department of Health and Ageing, the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy.</DOC>

YouthLinx funding in 2007-08 has not changed from the previous year.The difference from the 2007 estimates to 2007 Est Actuals and 2008 Estimates is as follows:48,441 and 50,0003,359 and 3,50019,891 and 20,000
 
The increase was derived from the actual figures that were provided through an enhanced reporting process which commenced in 2007. The 2006/07 FaHCSIA Annual Report (the Department which previously administered the YouthLinx program) notes that their PBS Estimates were not reflective of the current environment and that the estimate would be revised in the future.(c)   State and territory offices were consulted in 2007 regarding the enhanced reporting process. As stated in (b), the increased estimates are more reflective of actual engagements.(d)   I am due to visit a range of YouthLinx services prior to the end of the year.(e)   As stated in (b), the increased estimates are more reflective of actual engagements. Therefore, operating under the same level of funding, the Department will continue to working closely with service providers to ensure the ongoing delivery of the YouthLinx Program.</DOC>

Professor Scott Holmes was issued with a Kevlar vest, or 'flak jacket', and a Kevlar helmet for the visit. This is standard-issue equipment to any person travelling to Iraq or Afghanistan to protect against small arms fire and fragmentation injuries.Professor Holmes was a member of my travelling party. We made an unscheduled trip from Turkey, where I was an official guest at the Anzac Day ceremonies, through a country in the Gulf to Afghanistan before returning via a country in the Gulf to Australia.In the event of Professor Holmes being injured or killed on the trip, he would have been afforded the same treatment and care as any other member of my travelling party. The aeromedical evacuation system would have been activated to transfer Professor Holmes to the nearest medical facility and he would have been evacuated in accordance with current Australian Defence Force and International Security Assistance Force evacuation procedures.It is not possible to answer this hypothetical question, given that any issue of potential compensation or liability would have depended on the specific circumstances and details. It is not the case, however, that the Australian Government would necessarily have been liable had some incident occurred.</DOC>

Better Connections workshops were held over three years commencing on 1 July 2005 and concluding on 30 June 2008. There is no commitment to continue the Better Connections Workshops.The objective of the workshops was to improve labour market effectiveness by addressing local labour supply and skill shortage issues, increasing labour market participation, particularly of disadvantaged target groups and reducing unemployment.Better Connections Workshops were not targeted to any specific disadvantaged groups, the workshops aimed to improve the employment outcomes for all unemployed including disadvantaged groups, in the local labour market.Better Connections Workshops were a necessary part of the existing employment services system to enhance links between employment service providers and local industry.From 1 July 2009, employment service providers in the new employment services will be required to have better connections with other employment services agencies and other government services. Employer Brokers will also assist employment service providers to have stronger linkages with employers, employer groups and industry associations in areas of skills and labour growth. Therefore, there is no requirement to continue the Better Connections Workshops.</DOC>

Naltrexone implants are unapproved and unregistered therapeutic goods. As part of the registration process, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will consider the safety, efficacy and quality of naltrexone implants. To inform this process the TGA will consider the results of a range of naltrexone implant trials, including a clinical trial and associated research into the use of naltrexone implants, manufactured by Dr O'Neil's Go Medical Pty Ltd, carried out by the University of Western Australia. This trial was funded by the Australian Government through the National Health and Medical Research Council.Should naltrexone implants be approved and registered as a therapeutic good, they will be eligible for prescription in Australia.The Department of Health and Ageing separately provides funding of $618 180 to Dr O'Neil's Fresh Start Recovery Program under the Non Government Organisation Treatment Grants Program (NGOTGP) for the period 2008/09 2010/11. The purpose of this funding is to employ a counsellor, occupational therapist, social worker and psychologist to support the recovery of clients post detoxification, by providing a range of services including professional counselling, education and training, and information and referral to other services that will offer support to the client's re-entry into the community.The Fresh Start Recovery Program also receives a further $160 000 under the Australian Government's Amphetamine Type Stimulants (ATS) Grants Program to June 2009. This funding is for the development and implementation of staff training to better equip the program to meet the needs of ATS users.Neither of these grants provides funding for the use of naltrexone implants.</DOC>

I am aware of the article by Lenore Taylor and the report prepared by Port Jackson Partners for the Business Council of Australia. The Government is committed to addressing the competitive challenges facing business, particularly emissions intensive trade exposed (EITE) industries, once the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is introduced in 2010. We recognise the need to assess the impact of the introduction of a carbon price, particularly if it is ahead of effective international action. For this reason, the Government has signalled its willingness to provide transitional assistance to EITE industries that will be most affected by the introduction of a carbon constraint.Following the release of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Green Paper in July 2008, my Cabinet colleagues and I have been holding discussions with business representatives on how the Scheme may impact on business profitability and trade. These consultations are still proceeding and are an essential part of the process leading to the release of a White Paper later this year.</DOC>

This definition was based on the Study of Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Australian Nuclear Test Participants concluded by the University of Sydney's Scientific Advisory Committee.The definition of a nuclear test participant and the radii contained in the description of a nuclear test area, were made with regard to the findings of the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests in Australia, Dosimetry and Mortality and Cancer Incidence Study 2006, The Report of the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia (The McClelland Report) and other related research.In each of the locations (including that for the Monte Bello Islands) the radii definition is based on the distance between the explosion point and the furthest possible point of contamination. Maximum fallout contamination levels were recorded after each test, based on a number of different factors. The definitions of possibly contaminated radii that appear in the description of a nuclear test area are based on the most generous upper limit of these scientific boundaries. They are designed to include all personnel in the area who may have been exposed.In the case of the Monte Bello Island tests, the evidence obtained and opinion provided by the Committee pointed to a 10 kilometre radius for maximum fallout contamination in the water environment of those particular tests.The requirement for naval ships to withdraw a minimum of 10 miles at the time of the actual test explosion is explained in the McLelland Report under 5.5 'Safety of Servicemen'.The report states:'It should be noted that the Hurricane Trial Order No. 161 specified that all ships were to be withdrawn a distance of at least 10 miles from Ground Zero at H-Hour _ no Royal Australian Navy vessel was close enough to the blast to have been in any danger. Nor it seems were any of the ships in the path of the fallout from the blast. The ships were located at the time of firing so that the personnel on board were not in danger and that any exposure suffered must have occurred during the recovery and post firing phases of the operation.'The decision to withdraw to the 10 mile limit was a precautionary measure, whereas the 10km radius is based on scientific analysis of the site following the explosion. The distinction must also be made that the minimum distance of 10 miles is equal to 16 kilometres. Therefore the ships involved in Operation Hurricane were required to pull back six kilometres further than the Committee concluded was the applicable radius for exposure risk.Based on this evidence and the recommendations of the committee, the 10 kilometre radius is considered appropriate.</DOC>

The decision to close the Merbein facility was made by CSIRO in light of its science investment process, broad direction setting, and in view of its overall budget, which is made up of both Australian Government appropriation and industry funding for specific projects.While the site is being closed, most staff are being offered transfers to Adelaide where they will continue work on issues relating to wine grapes. The process of closure will be staged over approximately 30 months to allow for the completion of existing projects.Although the Merbein site is to close, CSIRO will retain activities in the Sunraysia district through continued use of a leased site at Koorlong. At that site CSIRO will continue work on wine grapes as well as completing existing projects on dried and table grapes. Horticulturists in the area will also benefit from other research conducted by CSIRO, particularly in relation to improving soil and agricultural productivity.CSIRO is assisting horticulturists meet the challenges of climate change through two major initiatives: the Climate Adaptation Flagship and the Agricultural Sustainability Initiative (ASI). The Climate Adaptation Flagship aims to deliver the best available scientific information and expertise to support Australia's efforts to adapt to climate change today in a practical and effective way. The Flagship's research is led by some of Australia's pre-eminent climate scientists, and will add significant value to how we adapt.ASI will help horticulturalists by seeking to increase the economic value to Australia from agricultural landscapes, reduce the ecological footprint of Australian agriculture and increase the resilience of Australian rural and regional communities.Since CSIRO's intention to close Merbein was announced in May 2008, senior staff in CSIRO have held several meetings with industry representatives to discuss the future of the site and related research matters. In early August CSIRO agreed to receive and review any proposition provided by the industry and/or the local community on the understanding that any such proposition would need to be received by late September 2008 and address directly the funding problem that the Merbein laboratory faces. As at 13 October no proposal had been received by CSIRO.</DOC>

 10 per cent to 30 per cent for automotive parts; 30 per cent to 100 per cent for passenger motor vehicles; 5 per cent to 40 per cent for textiles; 5 per cent to 50 per cent for clothing; and 5 per cent to 50 per cent for footwear.AANZFTA will provide for the elimination of a very high percentage of tariffs in ASEAN countries, generally in the range of 90 per cent to 99 per cent of all tariff lines. Detailed information on outcomes, including for particular countries and sectors, cannot be released until the Agreement has been signed. However, significant liberalisation will occur in both the automotive and TCF sectors.The more open trading environment provided as a result of the FTA, together with the regional rules of origin which will govern trade under the Agreement, should encourage greater use of regional supply chains that should support higher productivity and greater innovation. Australia's automotive sector already has a strong export profile and AANZFTA will provide new opportunities for the industry.Opportunities also exist for the TCF industry through reductions in tariffs in ASEAN countries. Australia's TCF industry has undergone substantial restructuring in recent years and there should be opportunities for it to gain greater access to ASEAN markets for its distinctive and innovative products, such as technical textiles. The recently released 'Building Innovative Capacity: Review of the Australian Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries' report underscores that the industry's future health lies in focussing on innovation and high quality textiles in a global market marked by diminishing levels of tariff protection.</DOC>

The Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme panel of Home Loan Providers comprises the National Australia Bank, the Australian Defence Credit Union and the Defence Force Credit Union. The providers advise that, while there is some exposure as a result of the financial turmoil in the United States, such exposure is limited. Much of this exposure has taken the form of increased fundraising costs, and is being experienced by most, if not all, financial institutions in Australia.Defence administers the scheme and mortgage arrangements are between the member and the chosen provider. Defence is not in a position to protect the mortgages and deposits held by Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel. The risk to the mortgages and deposits of ADF personnel is consistent with the wider Australia community.The providers have reaffirmed that their balance sheet position is sound. Furthermore, as the providers are authorised deposit taking institutions regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, stringent operational controls are in place to ensure the protection of depositor funds, including those of ADF personnel.During the scheme's tender evaluation, an independent financial viability assessment was carried out on each of the three providers. All tenderers were considered to be financially viable for the purposes of the tender.The performance of the providers is regularly monitored by Defence to ensure they effectively manage the delivery of services to ADF personnel.</DOC>

The Australian Government is committed to establishing a flexible and responsive national training system that is meeting the needs of students and industry as its central priority.Commonwealth funding for the state and territories' core VET delivery is assured, the focus of the new arrangements for 2009 - 2012 is a change from burdensome prescriptions over how the States should deliver services, to a more hands-off, flexible approach underpinned by outcomes-based public accountability.TAFE is, and will remain, the responsibility of state and territory governments under the Commonwealth-State agreements and they are expected to maintain provisions to ensure the quality and equity of their training, including for rural and regional areas.Through the Productivity Places Program the Commonwealth has invested an additional $2 billion in training, with more than 700 000 places created over the five years. Given the central role of TAFE in the training sector, it is expected that many of these places will be delivered by TAFE. As at 20 October 2008, 41 TAFEs around Australia (10 in Queensland, 10 in New South Wales, one in South Australia, one in Tasmania, 14 in Victoria and five in Western Australia) have been contracted to provide training under the Productivity Places Program.Approximately two-thirds of TAFE institutes have tendered to deliver training under the Productivity Places Program.Costing for the additional training places are clearly outlined in the Request to Participate. Listed below is the maximum amount of funding that the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will make available for training courses under each qualification level.Certificate II$2 500Certificate III$5 000Certificate IV$5 000Diploma$10 000The initial phase of the program has allocated funding on the basis of the cost of a qualification identified in a training provider's expression of interest to the department. The funding provided for the Productivity Places Program is additional to existing state and territory funding.As at 7 November 2008, 517 Registered Training Organisations have been contracted to deliver training in regional and rural Labour Market Regions (LMRs).Registered Training Organisations in Regional &amp; Remote* Labour Market Regions as at 7 November 2008Labour Market RegionNumber of RTOsACT29AdelaideBrisbane/SE QldRest of WA2Hunter/North Coast96Illawarra40NT19PerthCentral/North Queensland57Southern Queensland36Riverina21SA Country16SydneyTasmania40Eastern Victoria50MelbourneWestern Victoria68South West WA12Rest of NSW31Total517* Regional and remote areas excludes main cities, but includes Labour Market Regions of the ACT (including Canberra), Northern Territory (including Darwin), and Tasmania (including Hobart)</DOC>

Before the commencement on 17 February 2008 of certain changes to the permit system under the Northern Territory National Emergency Response legislation there was a legal requirement to obtain a permit to enter Hermannsburg. However, the community at Hermannsburg has had an informal arrangement that allowed members of the public to visit the community store, art centre and heritage precinct without needing a permit. Under the current legislation permits are not required to enter and remain on common areas of the community. Common areas is defined by subsection 70F(20) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Upon passage and commencement of the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Emergency Response Consolidation) Bill 2008 it would again be a matter for the community, through traditional owners and Land Councils, to decide on the public access arrangements for Hermannsburg.The Aboriginal Land Act (Northern Territory) has a mechanism under section 11 that provides for Aboriginal land, including communities such as Hermannsburg, to be declared an open area or a road to be declared open. The mechanism allows for the Administrator of the Northern Territory, on the request of a Land Council, to declare a town open:11. Open areasThe Administrator may, on the recommendation of a Land Council, declare by notice in the Gazette, an area of Aboriginal land or a road to be an open area or open road, as the case may be.Where a declaration is made under subsection (1), a person may enter and remain on the area of Aboriginal land, or use the road, described in the notice without obtaining a permit.In addition, subsection 5(8) of the Aboriginal Land Act (Northern Territory) allows for the temporary waiving of permit requirements:5. Issue of PermitsNotwithstanding the provisions of section 4, the Aboriginal Land Council for the area in which an area of Aboriginal land is situated or the traditional Aboriginal owners of an area of Aboriginal land may, by notice published in a newspaper or broadcast over a radio station, waive the requirement for a permit to enter the Aboriginal land or use a road bordered by that Aboriginal land specified by the Land Council or the traditional Aboriginal owners in the notice for the period or periods specified in that notice and the requirements of section 4 shall not apply over that area, or in respect of that road, for that period or those periods.</DOC>
