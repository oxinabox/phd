 - I very warmly welcome the question. As I said this morning, one has to distinguish between payments and reporting. In relation to quarterly payments, the system of quarterly payments has to continue, obviously, otherwise you would not have money for the states. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition then went out and endorsed the system of quarterly payments. He said, `They would be paying quarterly' - and we agree with that - `they could do it on the basis of the average established in one of those payments, the final of those payments.' What he seemed to be saying is that you pay quarterly. His idea was that you would just take off last year's return. There is only one problem: there is no last year's return on GST, a point that was made to him by John Laws. John Laws said, `Is Peter Costello misleading the people by saying there are no past estimates for them to work on?' The Leader of the Opposition made this statement, basically conceding that I was again right on that point - that there are no past estimates. He said this: `The past estimates will be created by the next BAS statement. You will actually have a year's worth of BASs.' You will not have a year's worth of BASs by the next statement because the next statement is due in April but you will have it by June. So he got that wrong. He said that you will have a year's worth of BASs by the next statement, by June. Essentially, what he is saying is that it has to be done quarterly and, what is more, in the first year - the transitional year - you cannot go off a previous year's statement, so you will actually have to do at least four quarterly returns in the transitional year. That is the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. I thought that it was more revealing for this point. I want to explain, when you take a policy-lazy position, the trouble that you get yourself into. Suppose next year that you were to take your quarterly payments off this year's return; suppose next year, in the financial year 2001-02, you were to take your payments off the returns that have to be done this year. It would only work on the basis that the GST base was the same. If you had a rolled-back GST in 2001-02, how could you use the quarterly payments on 2000-01? You would be paying on the current base in respect of a whole new rolled-back GST. The one thing you cannot do in 2001-02 is use this year's return whilst rolling back your base.  - The one thing you could not do in a subsequent year is take the returns off this year if you were using a different base because you would be collecting GST on this base which would not be the base in the year of assessment and payment. I do not think he has actually thought for a moment about his roll-back. Since 16 July, he has been promising roll-back. He has not thought about it for one moment and his statement today illustrates how lazy he has been because he is now promising to collect instalments out of an unchanged GST base. - That is what he is promising to do. The government has made the situation entirely clear: the quarterly payments will be continuing. After the first year has been completed - after having the year of experience, which you actually agree with - we will be ensuring that in future years the system is simplified, with all of those transitional matters which are taken out of it. We have already commenced consultation in relation to that. It will be substantially simplified once we have gone through the transitional period -  - which you actually support and say has to be done. And, Mr Speaker, I can assure the small business community of Australia, which has performed magnificently with now over one million returns in, that where those matters can be simplified they most certainly will be simplified, consistent with a quarterly payment period which even the opposition has now brought itself out to support.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. I am pleased to confirm to the House that last week I announced on behalf of the government a group of measures, worth almost $3 billion over a period of five years, which represents the largest commitment ever made by any Australian government to science and innovation. These initiatives are, of course, underpinned by a strong economy: no initiative in an area like this can hope to work effectively unless it is underpinned by a strong economy. One of the things that this government set out to do on election was to create very strong economic conditions and we have been successful in doing that over the last five years. The reforms that we have implemented have given us high growth, higher productivity and low inflation.I want to record my thanks to the members of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, particularly the Chief Scientist, Robin Batterham, and also the many other representatives of the academic and scientific community who sit on that council. It has been the source of very regular advice to me on matters relating to science, education and innovation. The aims of our strategy are to strengthen our research base, accelerate commercial applications and develop and retain Australian skills. The measures I announced included a doubling, through the addition of $736 million to the Australian Research Grants program, $246 million to upgrade university infrastructure, $176 million to create two centres of excellence - one in information and communications technology, another in biotechnology - major changes to the R&amp;D concessions, including the introduction of a premium rate for additional research and development of 175 per cent, and, very importantly, an increase by no less than 80 per cent in the volume of money from the federal government going to the collaborative research programs. This represents an additional $227 million. We are doubling the very successful COMET program. We are putting in another $100 million for innovation access programs and $151 million for 21,000 equivalent full-time student places with priority in ICT, maths and science. We are also introducing a loans scheme for postgraduate students which, it is calculated, over the years of the program will benefit something like 240,000 postgraduate students within Australia. That initiative in particular has been widely acclaimed, as indeed have all the other measures, by the universities of Australia and by Australia's scientific community. I am very pleased to note that, in the lead-up to the making of the statement and in the news reporting that has followed, there has been a very justified and welcome focus on the scientific achievements of Australians. It is worth recording in the wake of this statement that, of the Nobel peace prizes that have been won by Australians, only one - that was the one awarded to Patrick White - was in areas other than research particularly in relation to medical science. This country has a very proud record in generating new ideas. We have always punched above our weight in areas of medical research and medical science. I believe that the Backing Australia's Ability initiative will not only provide more resources - in some areas record levels of resources - but also send a very strong signal to the brightest and best within our community, and also to some formerly within our community now abroad, that this is a country, this is a government and this is a people that very strongly support science and innovation. </DOC>

 - Of course, the member for Hotham completely misrepresents us, as he usually does. What the government has said today, and what I have just said previously, is that, having come through the transitional year -  - You are actually in favour of quarterly reporting.  - You are in favour of quarterly reporting; it has been confirmed by both the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In the first year, where there are no previous payments to work off, you are in favour of quarterly reporting. They come out today: they are in favour of quarterly reporting in the first year and they are in favour of ongoing quarterly payments. That is their policy. What we have said is that after you have come through the transitional year you can simplify this very, very considerably, as I said earlier on today, with very substantial changes in relation to the form, which involves all manner of transitional issues. The government has said that it will be considerably simplifying the system once we have got through the transitional period. We have said that. The only way that you can considerably simplify is by keeping the base the same. There is no doubt that the Labor policy of roll-back would be the most exponentially increased complication of the system. Honourable members here will remember that it was 26 June, I think, when we last heard about roll-back. The Labor Party were going to roll back the GST on all manner of things; they just cannot tell you what they are.  - The member for Hotham interjects. He said, `We just did tell you what we're going to roll the GST back on.' What, fresh lettuces, is it? Is it tampons? It was education, it was books, it was pens, it was transport. They cannot name any single item, after five years of policy-lazy opposition. They are going to roll back the GST and massively complicate the system, and the only thing they cannot do is tell you how. Simplification, as we move through the transitional period, will come from keeping the base the same, knocking out all of the transitional things that were required for the first year and the first year only. The government will be ensuring that there is very, very substantial simplification after it has fully consulted with all the interested parties.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question. The indexation of excise operates automatically under legislation where excise, which is a flat dollar or cents amount, is indexed to the CPI so that it remains constant in real terms. The last indexation point took place on 1 February under legislation which was introduced in 1983 by the Australian Labor Party and under which the Australian Labor Party automatically moved the excise to the CPI on 23 occasions. The Labor Party passed excise legislation in 1983, and on 23 occasions it moved the excise to the CPI. I am asked whether I know of any proposed alternatives. The answer is that I do not know of any proposed alternatives, because the Leader of the Opposition, for all of his huffing and bluffing, did a very revealing interview on 3AW yesterday. He was asked this question:Mitchell: Is it possible you would look at taking the GST off petrol?Beazley: I don't think that we'd give that contemplation.Mitchell: But you might look at taking the excise off?Beazley: Nor the excise, for that matter.Mitchell: Will you consider taking the excise off petrol?Beazley: Well, if you took the excise off petrol, what particular schools would you start to shut?He has been out there arguing about petrol, and when it actually comes down to it he is in favour of GST and he is in favour of excise. And, what is more, he is in favour of indexation. The Leader of the Opposition says that he is against indexation if it is done now - it actually occurred on 1 February - but if he ever gets into government he will actually be in favour of it then. In other words, his proposition is this: he is against indexation when he does not have any power to do anything about it but when he has power to do something about it he is actually in favour of indexation. He is in favour of indexation if there is a Labor Party government, and he is against indexation if there is a coalition government. This is just another policy-lazy response from an opposition which will not give a straight answer to this question.  If you are so against indexation which occurred on 1 February, why won't you reverse it? Why won't you reverse it if you are ever elected? The reason that the Australian Labor Party will not reverse it is that they do not want to stand up and say that $500 million - which we would have to spend in reversing the indexation - as Mr Beazley said, will be saved by closing the following schools. That is what he does not want to do. He wants to go out there and create this idea that he is somehow against indexation, but he will never reverse it. If he is against indexation, let him say that he will reverse it. Let him say which roads will not be built, which schools will be closed. Let him say that he will do something when he absolutely has the capacity or some power. But this idea where he is only in favour of doing something when he has no power to do it is a policy-lazy response. It is just a stunt. If the Labor Party were serious, they would be pledging to reverse indexation.</DOC>

 - Labor's policy is to have two more quarterly reports under GST - April and June. That was the policy which they announced - two more quarterly reports, one in April and one in June. So, first of all, the shadow minister should understand the policy - that he is in favour of two more quarterly reports, one in April and one in June. He is also in favour of radically changing the GST base, which would require every business in Australia to reassess what GST was on and what it came off -  - and to also report separately on different liabilities. The member for Melbourne says, `Why would it?' Because at the moment they are returning GST based on those things to which GST applies. When you change those things to which GST applies there will be some businesses that will not have to return any GST, one would think, because their products would become GST free. - The reporting system which is on the BAS is not just in relation to GST; it is in relation to what used to be called group tax, PAYE, it is in relation to luxury car tax, it is in relation to wine equalisation tax, it is in relation to company tax, it is in relation to what used to be the prescribed payments system, the reportable payments system and other payments systems. Thirteen separate payment systems have now been reduced onto the one form. So, instead of doing up to 13 - some of which were monthly, the wholesale sales tax; some of which were quarterly and some of which were annually - they have now been reduced onto one form. That means that people have to have their quarterly reports in line but they do not have to do 13 payment systems. That has been a great improvement. Other great improvements for small business are: reductions in company tax, the 50 per cent cut in capital gains tax, the opportunity to roll over capital gains tax if you happen to be a retiree and the opportunity to have scrip for scrip capital gains tax free swaps in relation to scrip - all of which took a coalition government to introduce and all of which have been of benefit to small business.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to answer this question on behalf of the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. Can I say that, whilst the innovation statement has been very well received in industry, business and the research and educational communities, it has also been very well received in the defence area, because they are very big on research and development. I have already had some brief briefings on that from them. It is an integrated package dealing with skills, commercialisation and encouraging research and development. Not surprisingly, we have seen very positive reactions right across the board to the government's proposals. Just to pick out some, though, in answer to the question, the chairman of the CRC Association, Tony Staley, said it well when he said:This has exceeded all expectations -  -  - No relation - and is a great vindication of the CRC program.The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies president, Sue Serjeantson, said:We have re-entered the race to be internationally competitive. This is a great start. It drives home the message that science means business.Philip Holt, on behalf of Australian Business Ltd, and obviously looking at it from a small business point of view, said:The businesses that will benefit immediately are those at the sharp end of change, especially in IT.The Australian Industry Group, which has been a very strong proponent and advocate for the business interest in research and development, said:The innovation statement comprehensively addressed the key elements needed to strengthen Australia's innovation system.And the BCA applauded it as a:... major step forward which was very closely targeted.This is a credit to the minister and to the Prime Minister's chairmanship of the scientific advisory committee. It shows you that when a professional approach is taken by a government with the right priorities you can deliver real benefits where they are needed in the Australian business community, and that has been well recognised by these statements. What a contrast it makes to the policy-lazy lot we have on the other side. They have been there for five years, and the only thing they could think of was to put a few lectures online for university students, which has been available to them for years. I pay tribute to the PM and to Nick Minchin. This is a great statement and a tremendous move forward for innovation in Australia.</DOC>

 - I am pleased that the member for Hunter has asked me a question. Why would you believe a university study commissioned by the Labor Party in Victoria? Why would you believe a study commissioned by a Labor Party? It takes full benefit of every cent of GST income collected from the new tax system. The question has given me a great opportunity, though, to look through what your policies on small business might be. - And it won't take very long at all. You have not got any except roll-back, and your leader has just said that he is not going to roll back the tax system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. I can inform the House that the filing of the second quarterly BAS, which if you were filing as an individual was due on the weekend, has now seen, as of yesterday, a better lodgment rate than the first quarter BAS with over 1.1 million second quarter BASs returned. No doubt it will be a disappointment to the shadow minister that 1.1 million businesses have actually lodged their forms. For those that are lodging through tax agents, there is still another two weeks from the weekend to lodge those returns. As I said, 1.1 million with two weeks to run for tax agents - the lodgment rate was better than for the first quarter BAS.Lodgment information from the Taxation Office shows that 93 per cent of returns were lodged on time, and this represents a better outcome than comparable lodgment rates under the old system, that is, compliance has been better than under the old system. Ninety per cent of businesses indicated that they are confident that their BAS has been completed correctly. Research from the taxpayers themselves shows that, in relation to the first BAS, 63 per cent reported that it took them less than two hours to actually file. Ninety-two per cent of businesses needed to fill out only five boxes in the calculation area. I again recommend to businesses the accounts derived method, which is where you take the actual amount of GST straight from your computer records. There is no requirement to fill in the calculation sheet. I know I have said this in the House before and recommended this method, but I do recommend the method because there are still some businesses that believe you have to do the calculation sheet on the second side, when that is not actually required.Notwithstanding that, there are obviously businesses that have found that it has taken more time than the majority have suggested to fill out the BAS. The government believes that it should do everything it can to simplify reporting obligations. Now that we have the experience of the two returns and are halfway through the transitional year, we have the opportunity to very substantially simplify the reporting obligations. I can assure members of the House that it is the government's intention to do that. It has commenced consultation with all business groups in relation to that and believes that, after that consultation, it can introduce in a well thought out way very substantial simplification.</DOC>

 - In an ideal world, we would have cheaper milk, we would have cheaper petrol, we would have cheaper food, we would have cheaper rent and we would have lower housing interest rates. And we would have more schools, more hospitals, more roads and would even spend more money on research and development, even more money on defence and even more money on everything else - in an ideal world. But, as the Leader of the Opposition must surely know, we do not live in an ideal world. We looked very squarely at the possibility of cancelling or in some way reducing the excise adjustment for petrol that took place last week. We did look at that. We had a very lengthy debate about it. We made a decision that it was of better long-term benefit to the Australian people to invest $1.6 billion in additional road funding than it was to make an adjustment in relation to petrol. It is not possible in this less than perfect world in which we live to both increase road funding by the amount that we did, to defer the indexation increase -   - It is not possible to do both and also, in present circumstances, to maintain a responsible budget position. Those who argue that we should not only maintain the increased road funding but also defer the indexation increase should have the courage to put their commitment where their rhetoric is and promise that, if they become the government -  - No, do not wave a piece of paper around in the parliament. Why don't you have the courage to stand up and say, `If I, the Leader of the Opposition, become Prime Minister, I will cancel the February indexation rise for petrol.'  - But you were asked 21 times on Neil Mitchell's program whether you would be willing to do that. You were asked 21 times. - The only petrol tax cut that can be believed from the Labor Party is a Labor opposition promising to do it if they win the election and then going ahead with it. Everyone knows that what the Leader of the Opposition is doing is running around the community saying, `Look, they ought to stop the February increase.' But, when somebody says to him, `If you become Prime Minister, will you cancel the February 2001 increase?' he says, `Oh no, you can't ask me to do that - don't ask me to do that.' You know what he wants: he wants to refrain from making the promise so that, if at the time of the next election he does not feel under any pressure to make the promise, he will not make it. That is exactly the thought process of the Leader of the Opposition. All of this posturing does not represent any sincerity on the part of the Leader of the Opposition.You can attack our position, but it is a transparent position. We looked at this before Christmas and we had two options: we could have either put $1.6 billion extra into road funding or deferred the February increase. We decided to put it into road funding because we thought that was a better disposition of the money. You cannot do both: you cannot responsibly put $1.6 billion into road funding and defer the increase - at the cost of $500 million annually, which adds up to about $2 billion over a four-year period - and maintain, according to the opposition, an even larger budget surplus than the government are delivering. At the end of the day, when you start running around as a political leader, you have got to produce something that adds up and makes a bit of sense. You can have your pennyworth of fun running around holding up a bit of paper, but in the end you have got to tell the Australian people what you will do if you become Prime Minister. So far you have been given 50 opportunities and you have dingoed it on every occasion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, we had a very productive start to the year 2001 in terms of road funding and roads announcements. In the first week of the new year, we announced the full details of a $1.25 billion Western Sydney orbital road in Sydney - a vitally needed part of the national highway grid, which runs right around Australia. It will provide -   -  - You would think they did not want it, but actually, you know, the ALP, in a policy breakthrough, said that they thought it was a good idea. The Western Sydney orbital will provide a 39-kilometre route linking the Hume Highway in the south of Sydney to the M4 motorway in the north. It will bypass up to 56 sets of lights, it will save motorists up to an hour each way in travel time and it will, of course, bring very substantial economic development and further jobs to the western areas of Sydney - again, widely welcomed by people on all sides of politics in Western Sydney, despite the noises made in certain quarters in this place. It will, in fact, be the largest single road project under construction in Australia at the time that it is being progressed. At the same time, we announced a detailed study into the northern link to look at how we are going to connect the national highway between the M2 and the F3 in northern Sydney. It will provide a true north-south bypass of Sydney and will bypass the very heavily trafficked Pennant Hills Road. Investigations into options will begin shortly. I should add that they will not reopen the sensitive so-called B2 and B3 corridors.On January 4, I announced a substantial road package for the Illawarra and South Coast region. It was also very widely welcomed. As part of this package, the New South Wales Labor government have finally recognised Main Road 92 as a road of national importance and they have agreed to match the federal government's commitment to this important link road. At the same time, we announced the $34 million contribution to the North Kiama bypass on the Princes Highway, enabling that project to be fast-tracked.In Western Australia we have recognised the importance of the Roe Highway in outer Perth. That, too, will be funded as a road of national importance: we will put $76 million towards it. Higher mass limits are finally under way - an $840 million improvement in GDP annually. Which state held it back the longest? It was New South Wales. But we have had a breakthrough at last. As announced, the federal government will upgrade and strengthen bridges on the Newell Highway as part of $125 million in improvements on that highway.Of course, there is then the Roads to Recovery Program, which was widely welcomed by local governments across Australia. We are on track to start paying cheques under the Roads to Recovery Program by the end of this month. The Prime Minister referred a moment ago to the commonsense approach of looking to the future and building this national infrastructure. The fact is that it is a responsible government that builds for tomorrow and does not tamper with the excise system. That is what we are doing.The final part of the question went to alternative policies. The only alternative we have in this area is a policy bypass - not even laziness; just a policy bypass. The only announcement we have heard is the recognition that it was good to go ahead with the WSO. Labor never had a RONI program, so there was no Main Road 92, North Kiama bypass or Roe Highway. If they had had their way, there would not be higher mass limits. The New South Wales Labor government has held out for a long time on that vital reform. That is not just policy laziness in this area but a policy bypass.</DOC>

 - My initial remark is that the wild talk of windfalls by those opposite simply does not stack up. That is all that needs to be said. The second point that must be made is that we are spending a great deal of extra money - as I have just outlined - on a series of very valuable road infrastructure projects across Australia. The reality is quite simple: better roads deliver all sorts of economic benefits, such as lower fuel usage and safety - which is very important in Australia today. They reduce transport costs and make it possible for people to do simple things, such as take their children to school in many remote areas. That cannot be done in many parts of this country when there is wet weather or whatever.The other point that must be made is that, when it comes to fuel excise, Labor's hypocrisy knows no bounds. You are the masters of increases in fuel excise. Under you - with your high inflation policies - fuel excise rose by 500 per cent. That is worth repeating in the lull. You loved it; you were addicted to it. You could not help yourselves: you loved the high inflation that drove it; you were on a fix. You could not break it then and, despite your cheap rhetoric, you cannot break it now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for that question. I can inform her that unemployment in Western Australia peaked at 11.4 per cent in 1992 when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the member for Fremantle was the state Premier. The good news is that, since February 1993 - particularly since March 1996 - Western Australia has been the gold medal economic performer amongst the Australian states. Since then, there have been 200,000 new jobs, unemployment has come down from 10 per cent to under six per cent and average weekly earnings have grown from under $600 to over $800 - which is significantly above the national average. This increase is thanks, in part, to the spread of workplace agreements under federal and state legislation. Some 300,000 Western Australian workers - or nearly one-third of the work force - are on workplace agreements. I have been asked about threats to progress in employment. The Western Australian opposition has done a secret deal with the trade union movement to abolish workplace agreements. That secret deal, done by the policy-lazy Western Australian Labor Party, stipulates `the total abolition of individual agreements'. Forcing Western Australian workers back into the award system could mean a pay cut of up to 30 per cent. That means that Western Australian workers could be up to 30 per cent worse off if the Labor Party wins the coming election. The Court government has been a very good friend to the workers of Western Australia and it deserves to be re-elected on Saturday.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. She asked whether it is correct that it was my decision. No, it was cabinet's decision. Secondly, she asked whether it is correct that people have resigned. The fact is that nobody has resigned, because nobody was appointed. You cannot resign from a position that you have not been appointed to. I would have thought that would have been self-evident to anybody. Thirdly, she asked whether it is correct that the Tambling review recommended that the PBAC should not have an industry person. In fact, that was not one of the recommendations. I am told it was actually in the issues to be discussed. Finally, she asked whether it is correct that there is a crisis in the PBAC. None whatsoever. We have a better committee today than we had previously, from a more broadly representative group of people. The government has two main pharmaceutical advisory bodies, the PBAC and the PBPA. The Labor Party, when it was in government in 1988, saw nothing unusual about appointing an active person in the pharmaceutical industry to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. For seven years in government, it was happy to have an industry person as one of five people on the body that recommends pricing. To have, out of 12 on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, one person who is no longer involved in industry, has no conflict of interest and has divested himself of all interests is a benefit to the committee, as is being put by a large number of people. It was best put by the Pharmacy Guild and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia today. In the Australian, they were reported as describing the reaction to Mr Clear's appointment as `nothing short of hysterical'. They went on to say:To suggest that the appointment of Pat Clear is somehow going to lead to a free-for-all on listing drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is an insult to Mr Clear and ... the other eleven members of the committee.The fact is that we have a better committee. It is a perfectly well-functioning committee. A few people did not get their way; they have spat the dummy and they are trying to do as much damage as possible. They are of no consequence.</DOC>

This is a $117 million commitment by this government to dramatically change the way medical education is delivered in Australia and which will affect it for generations to come. We have had some idea of how this is going to work through what we have already done with the university departments at Geraldton, Whyalla, Shepparton, Broken Hill, Mount Isa and Launceston, and the new clinical school at Wagga Wagga. These have been a staggering success. In Wagga Wagga alone the clinical school has attracted 12 doctors through GPs - specialists who would not be there otherwise. I visited Shepparton with the member for Murray late last year. In Broken Hill there are over 60 people employed at the university department in rural health who would not be there had we not put the initiative in place. I was able to announce today new clinical schools at Coffs Harbour, Dubbo, Rockhampton, Toowoomba, Kalgoorlie, the Riverland - in your own electorate, Mr Speaker - Bairnsdale, Shepparton, Whyalla and Burnie. In addition, we have new university departments at Tamworth and Lismore.  This will mean that, when these are operating in 12 months time, 25 per cent of all medical students will spend half of their clinical training in rural Australia. A kid who comes from eastern Gippsland will not have to go to the city for six or seven years to study medicine. They will be able to go to the city for three years to do their basic science training and then go back into the country. We will be putting in a substantial medical and health infrastructure. In the cities in which it is already operating, we have shown what a difference this can make. In contrast, I was asked about other policies. We have a benchmark for the Labor Party. At the ANF annual conference the member for Jagajaga outlined areas where policy development should occur. She said:I will highlight the areas where I believe we should be developing new policies: ...Develop a publicly funded coordinated care program to supplement Medicare ...Overcome the major inequities of our health care systems with programs targeted at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health ...Improving access to health in rural and remote Australia.Tackle the special needs of mental health.Focus on health promotion ...Early intervention ...Control rising costs by ensuring technology is used effectively ...Reduce the frequency of adverse events by promoting quality ...Provide greater access to information for consumers ...In the honourable member for Jagajaga's own words, these are the areas where the Labor Party was going to develop policy. The only trouble is that that was July 1999. The honourable member said that she would be developing policies over the next nine months. Ten months after these policies were due we have seen not a single thought or idea in any of these areas. We have seen nothing but laziness and carping, with negative, opportunistic interventions in health, no policy work and none of the hard intellectual work that is needed to understand health and fix the problems of health.</DOC>

 - I cannot tell you off the top of my head how many decided not to serve -  - but I can tell you that 10 out of 10 who were offered a place amongst the most eminent people in Australia are actually on the committee already -  - and the fact is that you have a broader based committee than you had previously. The PBAC is under no threat whatsoever. The only threat to the PBAC was when we introduced one of the major reforms, therapeutic group premiums, that the Labor Party opportunistically decided to oppose. That was about half a billion dollars a year that is in fact being paid by the industry to keep the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in control -  - and the Labor Party opportunistically opposed it. So, if anyone is kowtowing to industry, it is Labor.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As he himself has demonstrated a very strong interest in defence matters, he will know that the government's white paper has been very well received - I must say that not just in the defence community or the broader defence family but generally in the community it has been very well received. If you could apply the barbecue tester, which I suppose I did over the summer period, Australians were saying that this was something that was important and in the national interest and that it was great that the government was giving priority and putting the money behind our Defence Force to make sure that they have got the resources. I am pleased to say that, since that guidance was provided, the government has already started to act on some of the principal elements. The capability plan was of course at the core of the white paper. Before Christmas we signed up on the airborne early warning system, the AWACS, and we have also started the tender process in respect of the armed reconnaissance helicopters - both cases demonstrating that the government is on the job, proceeding with the implementation of the defence white paper.I also want to say that, whilst that is obviously a high priority, with my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and minister assisting, we will certainly have personnel issues as a priority issue in the time ahead. It was nominated in the white paper. We are fortunate in this country: we have some of the best people in the Australian Defence Force. But we do have a challenge: we have got to keep the people that we have got and we have got to continue to attract good people. I must say I was very pleased to be able to meet some young recruits at HMAS Cerberus in my electorate, as my first official visit as the defence minister to a base. And I tell you what: it was heartening to see the quality of young people prepared to serve their country through the ADF, and I want them to know that this government is absolutely committed to this project, to the defence white paper, and I believe that will provide real opportunities in the future.I must say it brought a wry smile to my face when I read on 29 December that the Leader of the Opposition was extending to me a helping hand. -  - I take it in the spirit in which it was offered. But, when I got to the last paragraph, I must say I had to sort of reappraise this, because he said then:... I suspect, as always, it will be a Labor prime minister and a Labor minister for defence who will get Australian defence back fully on track.Today is not the day, but I tell you what: I have started reading the files on submarines, and let us never hear from this man again when it comes to defence. They never did what they said they would do, and I tell you what: when you read the subs file you know they never had the capacity to do what they said they would do. Under this government, defence is in good hands, and that is good news for the country.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that the early part of the question put to me is substantially in accord with my recollection, without having the document in front of me. It is true - and the government made no attempt at all to hide this fact - that we have made changes that introduce a premium rate but at the same time result in some revenue savings, and that was made perfectly clear. As to the cost of those last items you have mentioned, I frankly do not have that with me. I will be very happy to find that out and let the honourable member know. But can I say, in relation to the R&amp;D component of the plan, that it has been very well received by industry. It is not everything that industry wanted. Industry wanted us to go back to 150 per cent and some of them wanted a 200 per cent premium rate and of course they wanted the widest possible eligibility criteria. We all want everything in an ideal world, and we decided that a greater premium ought to be placed on putting resources into things like the CRCs. The CRCs have been successful. One of the pieces of evidence of the success of the CRCs is that they were originally leveraging about $2 for every one government dollar; it is now closer to $3 or $4. That does represent very good value for money. Overwhelmingly, the advice that we got when we were putting the group of measures together was that we should have a greater emphasis on the research side of the equation. To those ministers who accompanied me to meetings of the Prime Minister's Science Council, particularly the last meeting, when we went through very carefully the options that were open to us, it was very clear that there was unanimous support for a doubling of the Australian Research Council grants, and obviously you had to put in extra university infrastructure to make them viable. There was very strong support for putting extra resources into biotechnology and into information and communications technology - very strong support indeed. There was quite a bit of debate about the relative value of the R&amp;D part of it. It is instructive that the tax concessions in the United States, according to my understanding, are less generous in relation to research and development than they are in Australia. Therefore I say to people who simply recite the industry mantra that all you have to do is ramp up the taxation concession to ever higher levels, that that is not necessarily the universal experience of those around the world. But I would be very happy to see if I can get the information for the honourable member, and when it is available I will give it to her.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Wentworth for his interest in consumers, and particularly banking customers. Yesterday Westpac announced that it is going to start displaying on its automatic teller machines foreign bank fees associated with withdrawals and various other transactions at that automatic teller machine. So, if you are using a card other than a Westpac card at a Westpac automatic teller machine, they will start to tell you what fee is charged for that service. We welcome this because it puts consumers first. I am pleased to advise the House that I have been advised that today BankWest will announce that it will be following this policy with its 200 automatic teller machines. I am also pleased to advise the House that the Commonwealth Bank is going to follow and have this disclosure at its 4,000 automatic teller machines. This is a very important step forward. It is a small step but it is a very important step because it is starting to put consumers first. This government has delivered real reforms for banks. It is now time for banks to start to deliver the benefits not just to shareholders but to their customers. We are doing it through real policy initiatives. You get the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition who in November last year stood outside a Homebush branch of one of the major banks and started talking to the locals about how important it is to be tough on banks. We are currently undertaking the most significant review of consumer banking in Australia over the last few years with the Viney review of the code of practice for banking. The Leader of the Opposition is so tough on banks that when I went to see what submission the Labor Party had made to the Viney review, I saw submissions from the Australian Consumers Association, the ACCC, ASIC, the National Seniors Association, the National Farmers Federation, ANZ, Westpac, National Australia Bank - even the Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs put in a submission -   - Good question: who is that? The Australian Bankers Association put in a submission, I put in a submission on behalf of the government - but where was the submission from the Labor Party? Where was the policy contribution from the Labor Party? Why would it be that the Labor Party would not even bother to put in a submission to the Viney review of banking? Could it be that the Labor Party is a great example of policy laziness? Could it be that the Labor Party really does not give a fig for the interests of consumers? Could it be that the Labor Party is all gas and no action? It is about time the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party started to deliver real policies instead of gas.</DOC>

 - The roll-back policy of the Australian Labor Party is to change the GST treatment of various goods and services. The only problem is that they cannot tell you which ones, they cannot tell you how much it would cost, and they cannot tell you how they would pay for it. I have never seen a political party which has tantalised with so much and delivered so little. Even to this day they cannot tell you one single item which they would change the tax treatment of - either a good or a service. Now they attempt to define themselves out of roll-back, to run away from their own policy. They are yet to announce one single good or one single service whose taxation treatment they would change. Australia waits with bated breath for the roll-back policy. We have been waiting for five years now, I think, for a decent policy in relation to taxation. The government has said that it will take those steps which are required to simplify the BAS reporting. Those steps which can be done by the next quarterly payment, which is due in April, will be done by the next payment in April. Those steps which can be taken to dramatically simplify the system will be put in place. The government does not rule in or rule out particular proposals. It has commenced consultation in relation to this and will continue it next week. When the government announces that simplification it will announce it in a way which will give certainty - the government is not going to make piecemeal announcements in relation to this - to the small business community and dramatically simplify their requirements.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for that question. I know that many people on both sides of the House have followed with considerable hope - and at times, I think, a great deal of despair - the uncertain progress towards a peace settlement in the Middle East. In the context of that, the Israeli election was certainly a very crucial event. I would like to congratulate Mr Ariel Sharon on his victory. I understand that the former Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, has conceded defeat. It has to be said that Mr Sharon faces an enormous challenge in bringing peace to his country and to the Middle East. All Australians of good will wish him well, and also wish the leaders of the Palestinian movement well, in achieving a peace settlement. I want to record my respect, that of the government and that of many Australians for the attempts Ehud Barak made to secure peace in the Middle East. I do not believe that any Israeli Prime Minister could have done more to advance the cause of peace in the Middle East. To me, and I know to many Australians, it is a matter of lasting regret that the leaders of the Palestinian movement did not seize the opportunity offered by the leadership that Barak displayed in the time that he was Prime Minister. The offers that he made in relation to the basis of a peace settlement marked him as a person of courage and statesmanship who was willing to take risks in order to secure peace.I met both Mr Sharon and Mr Barak when I was in Israel last year. I can only say that, as a longstanding friend of Israel - and I know there are many in this House who would be happy to carry that label - I hope that for the future of that country, for the future of the Palestinian people and for the cause of peace there can be a coming together between Mr Arafat and the newly elected Prime Minister of Israel. In that context I certainly wish Mr Sharon the very best of good fortune. He has had a long experience in Middle East politics. I do hope that, as he takes over the very onerous task of the prime ministership of Israel, he takes pause to reflect upon the courage that was demonstrated by his predecessor.</DOC>

 - In terms of the Age article -  - On that basis, I will not bother.  - I recall that in the Age article what I actually said was that we were not ruling anything out or anything in. What I have seen from my coalition partners in this week of parliament is that they are keen that we consider all options. Funnily enough, the shadow minister for small business might like to note that that is what small businesses are saying to me as well - that they want us to consider all options. Unlike the Labor Party, who make policy on the run and then have to change it - roll it back, roll it forward, or roll it back and then roll it back - we are taking our time, as the Treasurer said, to ensure that we put in place a set of guidelines that will stand the test of time. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that this morning official interest rates were cut by 0.5 per cent. This brings the official cash rate to 5.75 per cent.An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - Mr Speaker, members of the gallery are home buyers and of course will -  - Members of the gallery who are home buyers will welcome this announcement, as home buyers throughout Australia have. This morning I called on the banks to pass the 0.5 per cent interest rate cut on to all home buyers. I can announce to the House that ANZ, CBA, NAB, Westpac, Aussie Home Loans, Wizard and some others have announced that they will be passing that on, with the National Australia Bank passing on a 0.5 per cent home loan interest rate cut from Monday of next week. We have a 0.5 per cent interest rate cut to home buyers, and all those banks have announced that they will be passing it on. That means that on the average mortgage held by Australians people will save $42 per month - $500 per year. The cut in the official variable home loan interest rate to 7.55 per cent compares with the interest rate of 10½ per cent which was prevailing before this government was elected in March 1996. If the Labor Party's interest rate were still applicable in Australia today, Australian home buyers would be paying $3,000 a year more in repayments on the average mortgage. That is $3,000 of after-tax income. The mortgage interest rate, which has come down from 10½ per cent to 7½ per cent on the average Australian mortgage, represents a saving of $250 per month to the Australian home buyer. Australians will welcome the news that interest rates have come down. The only significant criticism I have heard is from the Labor Party, which has criticised low interest rates. The Leader of the Opposition said that low interest rates would be a consequence of economic mismanagement. He presumably thinks that high interest rates are a consequence of economic management. And it is no wonder he thinks that, because under Labor management interest rates went to 17 per cent - presumably the most competent economic management that the Labor Party has ever seen! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spent all last year saying that the GST would put up interest rates. On 11 August 2000 on AM he said the government had loose fiscal policy.  - Exactly, he says. On the one hand he wants to say that the economy is slowing and therefore - what? - you should have tighter fiscal policy?  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is somebody who would say anything. He is determined on this economic path to try to make Whitlamism look responsible. Your great contribution will be to try to make Whitlamism look responsible. This is what he said on 11 August:... you've got a Government with loose fiscal policy and introducing inflationary policies through the GST, Australians are going to pay through higher interest rates.All last year the GST was going to jack up interest rates. Today the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh, the GST has actually knocked them down.' Those opposite must learn this in trade union training school. They say whatever it takes; it can be completely contradictory. If the sun comes up they say it is because of the GST; if the sun goes down it is because of the GST. They say the GST will put interest rates up; alternatively, they say the GST will take interest rates down. It all comes down to the GST. The Labor Party may be attacking a policy of lower interest rates, but on this side of the House we unashamedly recognise that as a good thing for home buyers, a good thing for small business and a good thing for farmers. It will put more money back in the pockets of individual Australians.</DOC>

 - No. That is absolutely false. The Reserve Bank said that its decision taken today was a consequence of recent data showing that consumer price inflation remains low. The principal reason is that the arrangements which I -  - So he concedes that it is low inflation. Okay. - You ask a question -  - Interest rates come down and the Labor Party has a bad day: that is what is happening. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition now concedes, the Reserve Bank said that consumer price inflation remains low. The principal reason is that the arrangements which this government put in place when we came to office were that we would target a two to three per cent underlying inflation rate and, after allowing for one-off factors, the rate of inflation coming out in the December quarter at 0.3 per cent was an indication that inflation was low and at the bottom of the band.The Reserve Bank also noted that there was a temporary effect in relation to a bringing forward of spending prior to 1 July, and it looked through that one-off transitional effect. There it is. It says, `This is a temporary effect due to the transitional response'. Then it says, `We looked through the temporary effects'. It is absolutely false for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -   - As the Reserve Bank said, it looked through temporary and transitional matters. Why would you base monetary policy, which will work in a year, or two, or three, on a past event with a one-off transitional effect? The truth of the matter is that the Labor Party was wrong, wrong, wrong. The Labor Party said that this government had underestimated the consumer price index impact of tax reform. If we were wrong on the impact on the CPI of tax reform it was not because we had understated it; it was because we had overstated it. It actually came in lower than we were expecting. All through the course of tax reform the Australian Labor Party tried to maintain that the CPI would be much much higher. It was wrong, wrong, wrong - false, false, false.It is good news for Australians that the CPI is low. It is good news for Australians that interest rates have come down. Leaving aside the period when the government has been in office, in the last year or two, at 7.55 per cent this is the lowest interest rate since the 1970s - a lower home mortgage interest rate than Labor ever had in a period of 13 years in government, including when the Labor Party had the Australian economy in its worst recession in 60 years. We on this side of the House think that is good news. It is good news for home buyers. They will have more money in their pockets. That is good news for small business. It is good news for farmers. The Labor Party may be disappointed, but what is in Australia's interests is much more important.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for a question that really goes to the heart of political, economic and social debate in this country, and that is the question of living standards of average Australians. My attention has been drawn to some statistics. My attention has also been drawn to a document that lists the priorities of the member for Brand, the leader of the Australian Labor Party, for Australia. One of those priorities - it is No. 3 in the document he released at the beginning of the year - is this:... better living standards for everyone, whether they live in the country or the city.All I can say on the basis of the statistics I have seen, and on the figures released today in relation to interest rates, is that if you want better living standards for everyone, whether you live in the country or the city, do not vote Labor; vote Liberal or National. If you really want to give effect to that third aspiration in this document, the last party you would vote for is the Australian Labor Party.What today's reduction in interest rates has done has been to remind the Australian people, and particularly wage and salary earners, of the improvements in living standards that have occurred over the last five years. As the Treasurer has said, we have a situation where, in paying off the average mortgage, a borrower is about $250 a month better off than he or she would have been had the interest rate policies of the Keating-Beazley government continued. We all remember very painfully that interest rates went to 17 per cent in 1990. It is almost unbelievable that in 1990, when the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the two former prime ministers who led the Australian Labor Party were in office, you had to pay $1,400 a month in interest for the average loan. Now, the average monthly mortgage bill on a $100,000 loan is not $1,400 but $630 a month. That is a measure of how living standards have improved under this government. But of course it does not end there. I believe one of the really proud boasts of this government is the way in which we have been able to lift the real wages of Australian workers. One of the great ironies of the last 20 years in Australian politics is that we have looked after the real wages of workers and the Labor Party decimated the real wages of workers. If you go back and look at the figures, real wages have risen by nine per cent over the last four years, compared with a rise of just 3.6 per cent over 13 years of Labor. But, very importantly and very crucially, when you analyse the rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition, the rise in real wages under the coalition is extended to the lowest paid award workers, who are significantly better off now than they were under Labor. Labor cannot say that these average increases are as a result of a complete bunching at the top, because when you actually go to the bottom area of wage comparisons you find that these workers are better off under the coalition than they were under Labor.Under the coalition, workers on the federal minimum wage, set at C14 in the metals award, have seen their real wages go up by nine per cent. In contrast, under Labor's accord, the equivalent wage is estimated to have fallen by five per cent. If you look at the wages of the lowest paid workers, they have gone up nine per cent under us and they fell four per cent under Labor. If you look at other measures of living standards - GDP per capita has increased at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent under the coalition as against 2.4 under Labor; real household disposable income has grown by 3.9 per cent under the coalition, compared with 2.6 per cent under Labor - the real wealth of Australians has grown by an average of eight per cent a year under the coalition compared with five per cent under Labor.I will return to my source document - to the references to `Kim Beazley's priorities for Australia' and `Better living standards for everyone' whether they live in the country or the city. All I can say is that, if you really want that, vote Liberal and National and not Labor.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The first thing I will do is to pay the NFF a compliment. It was the NFF, about 10 or 11 years ago, that converted me to the cause of tax reform - to the abolition of the wholesales sales tax, to the winding back of the level of fuel excise in this country and to the replacement of our indirect tax system with a broad based consumption tax. I think they lobbied long and hard and very successfully for that outcome. I certainly supported them in it, and I continue to do so. In relation to the issue of the BAS form, the NFF have made their views known and they have sent a constructive and thoughtful paper to me, which I have read with very great interest. The Treasurer, I believe, has it as well and, as the Treasurer has made plain - and indeed, as I made plain this morning - we have heard of a range of views. Certainly, in my electorate, which is a rural electorate, I have heard from farmers who have had no difficulty with it at all and from others who have said that they would like to see some simplification and can see some opportunities for streamlining. We have said quite plainly that we are prepared to look at all of those options and to take those issues seriously. We are on the side of the Australian farmers. We certainly have not inflicted on them the sort of economic mismanagement that they saw under you. - Seventeen per cent, the Prime Minister says. I remember revealing in this place - and it was never challenged - that some farmers with various penalties and so forth were paying up to 25 per cent when the ALP was in power. That is why the ALP ought to recognise that the sort of question just asked would receive no credibility whatsoever amongst farmers in rural and regional Australia. If there is one group that farmers do not believe has any answers to the challenges they face, it is that opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. The Prime Minister's innovation statement, Backing Australia's Ability, is a comprehensive planto turn Australian talent into jobs. It is a plan worth some $3 billion over five years. Under this plan, the salaries of top scientists and researchers will be lifted to international levels through 25 federation scholarships a year, worth $225,000 per annum. The number of postdoctoral fellowships will be doubled, the world-class centres of excellence in ICT and biotechnology will be funded, libraries and laboratories will be upgraded and more university places will be made available to young Australians seeking to lift their skills.This is a fully costed and funded plan which has been developed by hard work over 18 months. Someone was kind enough to hand to me a copy of the alternative from the opposition, Kim Beazley's alternative plan for Australia - `My plan'. Five years of policy laziness have produced a plan for Australia that is barely larger than a postage stamp! With apologies to Crocodile Dundee, this is not a plan. This one is a plan. This is a plan endorsed by all Australia's leading scientists and researchers. The head of the Australian Research Council, Vicki Sara, said that this plan - the government's plan - sets out a vision and pathway for Australia's best researchers and most promising young minds to deliver and develop their ideas in Australia. The government have put in the work. We put in the months of work to produce a plan which will make sure that Australia's talent and ideas come to fruition. As for the Labor Party, all it has to show after five years of policy laziness is this oversized postage stamp - and this is the large print edition! There is nothing to show. When the people of this country want to turn to a government which has a plan for Australia, they will be turning to the Liberal and National coalition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Actually, if you look at Hansard, I think you will find that there were wild claims in general being made about windfalls, which is entirely true. There are all sorts of misleading statements about $1½ billion to $2 billion, and all of this sort of stuff you see from a number of people pushing particular barrows here which have simply no grounding in truth or in fact. In very round terms, the last excise increase amounts to some $500 million or so. But it is interesting to note that in the previous estimate, when I think the excise increase was around 0.6c of a litre, in fact the receipts fell well short of estimates. These numbers do bounce around quite a bit. In terms of what the final outcome will be, I think the only comment that can be made is that we will know in due course, but we do not know at this point in time.The other point that I would make is that quite plainly we have made a very substantial investment in infrastructure, which is of great value to motorists and the people who use transport in this country, in terms of what we have put into roads - local roads, RONIs and the national highway grid - which investment is, apparently, on the ALP side, variously described, according to where you live and the time of day and whether you have a headache or not, as a pork barrel or a boondoggle or a waste of time or trivial or unnecessary.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Regional Solutions program is proving enormously popular in rural and regional Australia. Indeed, it is fair to say that the demand has been quite overwhelming. We have received almost 600 applications to date and the independent community advisory committee has been working through those. There have been some really fantastic ideas put up, and a number have already been made a reality thanks to the backing of the federal government with this $90 million program designed to give local communities the tools which they can then use to better fashion their future at a time of undoubted and - on this side of the House - recognised challenge.Some examples include $500,000 for the Back of Bourke Exhibition Centre. Bourke is a very innovative and forward looking community which is tackling its challenges and which is aggressively seeking to increase employment to improve opportunities for indigenous people in particular. This particular exhibition centre will help draw many more tourists to that very interesting part of the country. It will showcase Australia's outback history, literature and folklore and it is particularly relevant with the Year of the Outback coming up next year. We have seen another example - the $200,000 grant to the Lake Eyre Basin Coordinating Group, which is based at Longreach in the member for Maranoa's seat, where they are seeking to develop a heritage tourism strategy for the Lake Eyre Basin. There are any number of very useful examples which are going to make a very real difference.Those opposite would have regional Australia believe, through their rhetoric, that we have been inactive on regional policy. That is the great lie that the ALP try to perpetrate in the bush. The reality is that they have done nothing. They have been unbelievably policy lazy in this area; there has been nothing of any value at all. While we have been implementing a whole raft of valuable programsfrom the Roads to Recovery program right through to salinity, the NHT and real reforms in education and health in rural and regional areaswe have the Leader of the Opposition returning from his summer break to unveil his themes for this year making the absurd claim that the ALP had a lot of policy out there. He said: We've been releasing policy in the areas of education, living standards, regional affairs and the like.It gets a bit vague - `and the like'. That is what he said on 22 January. Nobody knows about this regional affairs policy, not even the shadow minister. The only policy they have got is to have a policy to have a policy. After five years, that is all they have got. It is nothing short of a policy fraud. The reality is that every decent policy initiative we have taken for rural and regional Australia has been opposed by them. Whether it has been roads or whatever, it has been a `rort' or a `pork-barrel' or a `boondoggle'. The reality needs to be clearly pointed out to people: there is no commitment on the other side to improving the lot of country people, despite the postage stamp policy. There is no commitment there at all whereas, by contrast, we have any amount of good, sound policy for rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I had been waiting for some statements regarding the 30 per cent rebate, because there are some very important answers that holders of private health insurance would like to know. It is now 136 days since Cathy Freeman won a gold medal in the 400 metres, and that same day, in the afternoon, Labor announced a $2 billion health policy without a press release, without putting it on their web site and without any follow-up. What Labor have not answered is some very simple questions. Are they going to exclude ancillaries from the rebate? Are they going to exclude high front-end deductibles? Are they going to be making eligible those products with exclusions? Are they going to restrict the rebate to current policy holders? Are they going to pay the rebate only on base-rate premiums? All of these things could be done within the weasel words put out by the opposition 136 days ago. These questions need to be asked because, between November 1998 and April 2000, we had 31 media releases from the shadow minister for health that were critical of the rebate. It is interesting to note that the only follow-up comment the Leader of the Opposition has made was in November, when he said the following:My shadow minister, Jenny Macklin, and I have made it clear that Labor will retain the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. We have checked the Labor Party's web site. We have checked the web site of the member for Jagajaga. We have checked every press release. We have checked every transcript we can find. We do not know whether the shadow minister for health has ever raised this issue once. I am sure every holder of private health insurance in Australia would like to know when and where the opposition spokesperson on health has actually made this clear.I have had correspondence from the Labor Party. Honourable members will be interested to know that the president of the Kurilpa branch of the Australian Labor Party has written to me. At their December meeting, they discussed the 30 per cent rebate, and they decided to condemn government policy and to request an explanation from me. For the interest of honourable members, I table the letter from the Kurilpa branch. Honourable members, I am sure, will be pleased to know that I have written back to Ms Finnimore and pointed out that, in fact, she is also criticising Labor Party health policy and that she might like to take this up directly with Mr Beazley. I am happy to table my reply. It is very simple: Labor do not have a clue what they are doing on this. They are taking a simple, populist view. They are not putting out the difficult health policy work. It is a lazy health policy. In the end, you cannot fix or do anything about health if you do not understand it, and Labor have not put the work in to understand it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question because it is a chance to clear up a completely incorrect article on this matter that appeared in one newspaper. It is a small point but it is actually cabinet, not me, that makes these decision when they are over $20 million a year. In doing that, cabinet has the chance to take advice from all departments. It is quite strange - and I guess I can understand it, because it is a complex area and in opposition it is hard to understand - but the PBAC has no role in pricing whatsoever. The pricing body is the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. So, if the PBAC is actually recommending a price, it is going way beyond its brief. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority, also an independent body, recommended that government list this, and it came to agreement with the company at $1.17 a day. So we took the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority's advice, as we should and as is absolutely proper.In the submission I put to cabinet was normal proper advice that had come up through the committees. I had not sought to influence that myself directly or indirectly in any way whatsoever. We now have some disaffected former members of the PBAC trying to say the government somehow did not take their advice. Why would we take their advice when they are not the body that advises us on pricing? It would be patently absurd to do so. I should say that the price we listed - $1.17 per day - is, I am advised, the cheapest price paid by a government anywhere in the world. We have achieved a price that no other country has been able to achieve. That a body with no power or expertise to list on pricing should recommend $1 a day is completely meaningless. It should have stuck to its area of brief and not tried to take over another committee's work. Finally, had we attempted to go ahead with the PBAC recommendation - which I think would have been quite improper, given it is not their responsibility - we would never have got the drug listed in the first place. So we have achieved a world best price, absolutely in keeping with proper practice and, I tell you what, people on Celebrex are pretty happy about it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I can inform the House that unemployment in Queensland peaked at 11.1 per cent in 1992, when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. I can also tell the House that state Labor has been just as bad as federal Labor at getting unemployment down. Unemployment in Queensland was over eight per cent in June 1998. It is still over eight per cent, despite Premier Beattie's promise to get it down to five per cent in just one term and despite national unemployment falling by 1.6 per cent in that time. Since June 1998 unemployment numbers in Western Australia under a coalition government have gone down five times faster than unemployment numbers in Queensland under a Labor government, in part because one of the first significant acts of the Beattie government was -   - The employment prospects of Queenslanders were harmed when one of the first acts of the Beattie government was to accept union dictation and to virtually remove the right of Queensland workers to enter into individual agreements. The latest example of union arrogance in Queensland is the CEPU's - the communication union's - decision to send Telstra workers who are not union members a bill for $400 for services which they never requested and do not necessarily need. If a company did something like this it would be guilty of an illegal act under the trade practices legislation. But this is what is going on in Queensland under the Beattie government. The one million non-union workers in Queensland all face receiving a bill of $400 each if the Beattie government is returned.The Leader of the Opposition is absent today campaigning in Queensland. I ask him: does the Leader of the Opposition endorse this kind of union extortion? And, while we are on the subject, does the Leader of the Opposition have full confidence in the Al Capone of Queensland vote rorting, who also happens to be the national vice-president of the ALP?</DOC>

 - I can only reiterate and expand on the issue of what the PBAC does. It advises on cost effectiveness. But the issue of negotiating price is an issue for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. Had they gone ahead with what the PBAC had suggested, you would not have got the drug listed. It simply would not have happened. We already listed it at the world's lowest price, which is not a bad effort. What I did was rely on the advice of my independent committees. I had not sought to influence them in any way whatsoever on price. I put that to cabinet, cabinet agreed and we ended up making a very substantial announcement that has helped an enormous number of Australians. So it was a perfectly normal process.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. With the reduction of one half of a per cent in interest rates today, it is important that the benefits flow through to consumers as quickly as possible. In the past, the banks have been quick to pass on interest rate increases and slow to pass on interest rate falls. The government's view is that banks should move as quickly as possible to deliver to Australians the full benefits of a one half per cent cut in interest rates. This should extend right across the board - not just home loans but also credit cards, small business lending and other business lending. As the Treasurer said earlier, it is pleasing that the banks, including National Australia Bank - Australia's largest bank - Westpac, ANZ, Suncorp Metway, CBA, and the mortgage providers, Wizard and Aussie Home Loans, have committed to deliver the interest rate cut in full and early. This is competition at its best. This is a direct benefit of the banking reforms that we undertook in 1997. Under the banking system we inherited from the Labor Party in 1996 - this is very interesting and very revealing about the Labor Party - it took 51 days for the banks to pass interest rate cuts through to home borrowers. Today it has taken four days - so, 51 days under the Labor Party and four days under the coalition. Under the Labor Party, it took 35 days for banks to pass through interest rate cuts to small business. Today, under the coalition, it has taken just seven days from Westpac. Even in the dark days of the 1990s, as the member for Parramatta would say, when home loan borrowers were carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders - like Atlas - when interest rates were 17 per cent, under the Labor Party's banking laws, it took more than a month for interest rate cuts to flow through to home borrowers. This is the stark difference between a government that is committed to reform, a government that has a commitment to good policy, and a policy lazy Labor Party. The Labor Party did not even bother to put in a submission to the current review of banking. It is too lazy to bother to put in a submission on something that is important to Australian consumers and to Australian small business. If the Labor Party - should it ever be elected to government - is policy lazy in opposition, it will be policy lazy in government.</DOC>

 - This is being put around by one particular former member of the PBAC. I can understand why they are trying to blame someone elsethey got their numbers wrong. We rely on the data from the company, which seriously underestimated the volume of Celebrex and the strength. The PBAC made their own estimates on which they advised the PBPA and the government, and they got it seriously wrong. They got it wrong in two areas. They got it wrong in the volume of prescriptions that would be made and they got it wrong in the strength of the prescription that doctors were going to prescribe. They advised us that there would be a higher volume of lower strength prescriptions and that has not turned out to be true. - I have commented several times on price and I will just say -  - We took the price of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. Had we taken the price of the PBAC - they were not charged to give us advice on price but rather on cost-effectiveness - the drug would never have been listed. The fact that it is costing money means that many more consumers are benefiting from the drug. In my entire time as health minister this is the only pharmaceutical where I have been stopped in the streets and had people say thank you. It is a widely used drug. We hope to get the price down. When we list a new drug, we have to take some guesses about volume. People on the PBAC are going around maliciously briefing that we have somehow ignored their advice - if we had taken their advice, we still would have consumers paying $60 a month because it never would have got listed. We got the best price in the world. We have had discussions with the company - the principal company, I might say, is Pharmacia and not Pfizer - and we are looking at ways that we can get smaller start-up packs and encourage a greater volume of lower strength prescriptions straight up. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. This is a very important issue. Over a long period, Australia has been at the forefront of those who have generously accepted responsibility for refugee resettlement. It continues to lead in the context of the very significant challenge that the world is facing in relation to the refugee convention, particularly for those who require support. At the moment we are second only behind Canada in the number of people we resettle each year on a per capita basis. Over the 50 years since the end of the Great War, Australia has settled something in the order of 600,000 people as refugees and on a humanitarian basis.We were one of the first signatories to the UN Convention on Refugees, but the fact is that today that convention is no longer able to work in the way in which it was originally intended. It has lost its focus and is not assisting those in greatest need. I have mentioned to the House and I will remind members again that I think one of the most graphic comparisons about the tremendous inequality of outcome results from the way in which the convention is applied to developed countries and the capacity of the UN to assist those in countries of first asylum where resources are not available. The UNHCR have a budget of $1 billion and they receive payments of about $800 million to look after the needs of 22½ million refugees and people of concern. Yet developed countries spend at least $10 billion assessing the claims of half a million asylum seekers, of which around 50,000 will be found to be refugees.The UN is left with cents a day to look after people in Africa while we are spending the equivalent of an Australian age pension on each person who makes an asylum claim successfully in Australia. Those comparisons can be seen right around the world. I have called for reform to that system. Australia does not want to walk away from its obligations - it has been a leader in these matters - but I am pleased to see that overnight the British Home Secretary, Jack Straw, has echoed my comments. He had this to say -  - It is a year after those comments I made. Nevertheless I appreciate the efforts that he is now putting into these matters, because I think there are some important lessons for us all in what he has had to say. In his speech yesterday Mr Straw said:... the current system is failing many refugees, while at the same time putting huge pressure on receiving nations - not just Western states, but also developing countries which host large numbers of the world's displaced persons.Of course the illegal movement of people is hampering our ability to help those in greatest need. The coalition domestically has raised the same issue that Jack Straw raises. I will just take members through it. He says: Taken together, these two trends - that is, of the convention placing no obligation on states to access their territory for those in need of protection, coupled with the obligations that first asylum seeking countries are faced with - of increasing economic migration, and increasing numbers of displaced persons - mean that we are faced with a situation where too much effort and resources are being expended on dealing with unfounded claims for asylum, and not enough on helping those in need of protection.He goes on to say:But refugees and the public also have a right to expect that there will be a quick and effective process in place for identifying those who make unfounded claims ...He then says:... we must ensure that those who are not refugees are dissuaded from seeking to benefit unjustly from the terms of the 1951 Convention.Interestingly, he goes on to say the EU should now look at a resettlement program. I might say that it has never had one in place before - a resettlement program like the one that Australia has had. He does not say that, but that is by implication -  -  - We have had it - we had it under your government - and it remains very much in place, even though some people would often think that it no longer exists. He goes on to say:There are two main ways of deterring misuse of this kind. The first is to process claims quickly. There is a range of measures which states can implement to domestically address this.He continues:Everyone who is concerned about the need for international protection should be in favour of an effective system for returning those who do not have such a need.These are positive comments. They would reflect, I think, the concerns that this government has about people who have no bona fide claims but who access judicial review and class action provisions in order to delay being removed from Australia. If Jack Straw were here today sitting on the other side of the House, I think we would have heard a far more positive contribution from him. In fact, we would not have heard some of the debate today about people being a policy-free zone: The shadow minister for immigration said:The minister's response, of course, is, 'Well, what's your solution?' Well, I am not the minister. The opposition is not in government. You are the minister. You come up with the solutions and we will have a look at them.That is the extent to which they are interested in policy. They ought to take a leaf out of the book of Jack Straw and find their way through these issues in a comprehensive way, and look at solutions and being part of the solution rather than being part of the problem.</DOC>

 - Today's labour force figures showed a decline of 3,500 jobs in the month of January. However, over the seven months from the commencement of the financial year, employment has increased by 41,000 and, over the last year, 180,000 new jobs have been created in Australia. Since this government was elected in March 1996, 774,600 Australians have been put into new jobs. Indeed, the unemployment rate - which is today at 6.7 per cent - compares with the unemployment rate of 8.5 per cent when the government was elected. It is a full two percentage points lower than when the government was elected. Let us compare the current unemployment rate with the rate for the period when the now Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment. At that time the unemployment rate was 11.2 per cent. During the entire period of his tenure as unemployment minister, unemployment averaged 10.9 per cent. Unemployment today is at 6.7 per cent. As the government has indicated, keeping the Australian economy growing is the best thing that we can do to create new jobs. That is consistent with good economic management. In addition, labour market and welfare reform will be supportive of new job creation, and the best thing that the Labor Party can do is pass the government's industrial relations reforms.</DOC>

 - From time to time, you come across third party assessments of the Australian economy and I thought I should inform the House of one that I discovered recently, which said: The Australian economy has continued to perform strongly over the past year, with solid economic growth, moderate wages growth and improved international competitiveness. Unemployment has continued its downward trend of a year ago, with strong labour market performance and productivity growth - The member for Kingsford-Smith apparently disagrees with that assessment. Also part of that assessment was the following statement:While some commentators have suggested an easing in the rate of economic growth, the fact is that Australia's growth has been sustained and consistently at the high end of expectations. Even with some easing, Australia's growth will be higher than estimates for each of the G7 countries and higher than the EU and OECD.Those are very interesting assessments. Who are they from? They are the assessments of the ACTU. In its living wage submission which it filed last Friday, the political masters of the Australian Labor Party assessed the Australian economy as performing strongly, outperforming G7, EU and OECD, and continuing its good performance. In fact, it was a remarkable endorsement of the government's economic management. All of this was done in support of the ACTU's claim, which is based on getting a wage increase in the context of current economic developments. What we do is support wage increases based on increased productivity. Because productivity has been increasing, wage levels have been increasing under a coalition government in a way they were never able to under Labor. I can remember being here throughout the early 1990s and seeing the then Treasurer and the then Prime Minister - Labor - walking to this dispatch box and boasting about how they had reduced real wages. One of their great boasts was that real unit labour costs had fallen under Labor. They said, `Isn't that a wonderful thing for the economy?' We take a different view. We think that if you have increasing productivity, living standards can increase, and if you have good economic management you will have better productivity. But you will not have it on budget deficits of $10 billion. You will not have it under a Beazley finance minister leadership. You will not have it under a monetary policy which is almost non-existent. You will not have it under a group of people that would take Australia back further than Keatingism - a group of people whose aim in life is to make Whitlam look good. Good economic management, increasing living levels - that is the policy of this government.</DOC>

 - That is three questions in three days. You have already used more than half your quota for last year. You asked five questions in 20 weeks of parliament. - The opposition well know what this government is doing about small business. We are out there and we are listening. We are looking at all the options to make the BAS easier for small business. What are the Labor Party doing? The first thing they usually do is decide whether or not their policy is any good. They have already worked out this week that they may have to roll back the roll-back or they may have to bring in a new system. When they get confused - and they confuse small business all the time - what they do is form a committee to go and talk to small business. We on this side of the House are already out there talking to small business; we are already listening to small business. All the opposition have done this week is form a committee.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. As to the first part of her question, there will be a quite significant impact on the wellbeing of Australian business generally, as well as on mortgage holders and, in particular, Australia's exporting businesses. Some interesting statistics came out of the announcement yesterday to reduce interest rates by half a per cent - that is, business borrowing costs from banks alone will reduce by $1.2 billion per year. So it is a further $1.2 billion burden off business generally across Australia. Exporters are likely to receive a reduction in these costs of around $300 million per year as a direct result of the latest rate cut. The farm sector alone will benefit by over $100 million per year in reduced costs because of lower interest rates. From the time that the coalition government was elected in 1996 we have had an absolute focus on maintaining sound fiscal principles, sound economic management of the Australian economy. We have focused on keeping a stable, low interest rate regime in Australia. It is interesting that, since yesterday, the farm groups have commented on the benefit to farmers across Australia, particularly those exporting out of regions like the Riverina. The New South Wales Farmers Association point out that the direct cost savings and their flow-on effects will add over $1,000 to the average farmer's cash income. The NFF release was quite compelling, because it broadened the comment out to the economic management of Australia. They said:The ongoing focus on improving the budget finances has delivered a range of benefits to the Australian economy, most notably a low inflationary environment, lower interest rates and, importantly, scope for reinvestment into infrastructure.That is a very telling comment from the NFF. Of course it does all of those things. We have slowly but surely built ourselves into a position in this country where we can be reinvesting in the infrastructure of this country and that is absolutely beneficial to the rural community, exporters and manufacturers, including in the seat of Riverina.One of the other things that we are doing specifically for exporters in rural and regional Australia is establishing a network of TradeStart offices where we are helping facilitate more small business involvement in the export effort, bearing in mind that one in five Australians who are employed are employed in industries that rely on exports in rural and regional Australia. That is one in four Australians. Just last week I opened a series of new TradeStart offices in Western Australia: in Kununurra, in Geraldton and in Carnarvon. In fact, there is a TradeStart office in Wagga Wagga in the member's electorate. All these things are being done to help facilitate greater involvement in the international marketplace, where we have seen exports over the last three years of a coalition government go from $119 billion to $126 billion and, in the last calendar year, to $142 billion - making a significant contribution to the growth of our economy. Fundamentally, the key economic settings that our government has focused upon have provided the environment, as the NFF says, to encourage a low inflationary environment and lower interest rates, which provide benefits right across the economy and make us much more competitive. At the same time as we were undertaking all those measures, the voters of Australia, particularly in rural and regional Australia, recognise the fact that we were opposed at every point along that path by the Labor Party. Every single measure we undertook to strengthen the economy of Australia was opposed by the Australian Labor Party in this place. So there is no benefit flowing to rural and regional Australia, particularly for the broader business community, from the activities of the Australian Labor Party in the federal parliament. </DOC>

 - I have to be honest and, for the member for Scullin's information, I do not read the Diamond Valley News, but I will have to add it to my list. I am sure the member for McEwen will tell me that it is a great read. There are some great reads in regional newspapers all over Australia and they are great little small businesses. The member for McEwen has already asked me to visit the small businesses in her electorate and we are scheduling those visits in a couple of weeks. In terms of the stallholders -   -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, there is anecdotal evidence from small business that they are at times having some difficulty with the BAS. As we have said repeatedly in the House this week, we are looking at all the options. But there is just as much anecdotal evidence from small business that they are finding the BAS easy and that they are finding quarterly returns are improving the way they operate. I had a small business on Saturday tell me -  - that, because they are able to hold the GST that they take, they have paid the T2 instalment so that they can hold shares in Telstra out of the profits that they have made from the interest that they earned on their GST. So some businesses are actually enjoying the BAS. - In terms of the fair, I do not think it has got anything to do with the GST. My understanding is that the fair is closing because they are having difficulty in raising enough participants to participate on the day. I have absolute faith that those small businesses that are having difficulty with the BAS will deal with the issue by contacting their signpost officers and contacting their ATO offices as the data on the secondary return of the BAS will indicate very shortly. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. She would know that on 1 July 2000 the largest personal income tax cut ever in Australia was delivered by this government. If it were not for this government, if the Labor Party had had its way, we would have people on average earnings paying a marginal rate of 43 cents in the dollar rather than 30 cents in the dollar. What the Leader of the Opposition will never tell you is that he would prefer to have single income families on average weekly earnings paying up to $50 a week extra in income tax. The Labor Party opposed income tax reductions. As well as that, company tax was cut from 36 per cent to 34 per cent - a great thing for small business. In addition to that, capital gains tax was cut. You now only have to pay capital gains on 50 per cent. Again, the Labor Party could never have done it. And Labor's beloved wholesale sales tax was abolished.If GST is so opposed by the Labor Party, why doesn't it pledge to reverse it? If the member for Scullin really wants to get up and say that everything that is wrong with the world is caused by the GST, why wouldn't a Beazley government reverse it? You can go back to a wholesale sales tax system. Swaziland has one. You could abolish a GST and reintroduce a wholesale sales tax. But what does he want to do? He is so against GST, he wants to get elected and keep it. He is so against the private health insurance rebate, he wants to get elected and keep it. He is so against all of the things that this government has done that his desperate wish is to try to get elected and to try to take advantage of our policy. It is not just those tax reforms that have already taken place. There is further tax reform to come. If it had been left to the Labor Party, financial institutions duty would never have been abolished; yet on 1 July of this year, financial institutions duty will be abolished. For the first time ever, a convenience store with a turnover of $1 million could save $600 in financial institutions duty. Wouldn't that be terrific? Its savings on company tax, as it comes down to 30c, will be $1,600. I know the Labor Party is opposed to abolishing financial institutions duty. But, if you are so opposed to abolishing financial institutions duty, will you be pledging to reimpose it when you get elected? It is just another one of these taxes that the Labor Party opposes every step of the way when its ultimate dream is to try to take advantage of it. - On 1 July this year, financial institutions duty will be abolished. It took a coalition government to do it, and the Labor Party fights us every step of the way. On 1 July this year, the company tax rate will come down to 30 per cent. It never could have been delivered by the Labor Party. On 1 July this year, stamp duty on shares will be abolished, a reform which will cut nearly $700 million in the first year off taxation. It will be great news for the mums and dads who own Telstra shares when stamp duty comes off their Telstra shares or any other shares. For business, which has already had the advantage of cheaper motor cars, on 1 July this year they will start getting input tax credits as to half, and on 1 July the year after. These are the benefits of taxation reform which continue to occur under this government - lower income taxes, better family allowances, lower company taxes, lower capital gains tax, abolition of stamp duty on shares, abolition of financial institutions duty, abolition of wholesale sales tax and the introduction of a modern taxation system. I suppose the greatest flattery out of all of that is the Labor Party's desire, having opposed all of that reform, to imitate it, to keep it and to take advantage of it. On this side of the House, we want to continue good tax reductions and we intend to do so.</DOC>

 - I can only repeat what I said yesterday. FuCell tell me they make cells and not drugs; that they do research but that they do not do research into pharmaceuticals. My department was aware of Mr Clear's association with FuCell. They deemed it to be no conflict of interest. I have a letter signed by my secretary saying:... The department advised you that it had undertaken appropriate procedures and concluded that Mr Clear had no conflicts of interest with respect to his appointment. I agree with them.

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I am very pleased to say that the Howard government's stand against crime is paying off. Over the past four years we have invested more than $300 million more than was the case under the previous Labor government. We have increased the number of AFP officers to around 2,800 and increased the number who are engaged in front-line policing duties. This has resulted in some outstanding successes under our Tough on Drugs Strategy and our initiatives to counteract money laundering and people-smuggling. Just this week a Commonwealth law enforcement task force, coordinated by the National Crime Authority, cracked an alleged money laundering syndicate. In September, in WA, a joint investigation between the Australian Customs Service, the AFP and the WA police successfully intercepted a large consignment of chemicals used in the manufacture of amphetamines and amphetamine laboratories. We are keeping billions of dollars of illicit drugs off our streets, we are putting drug dealers behind bars and we are cracking down on people-smugglers.I was asked about alternative policies. In contrast to our crime prevention policies, Labor seems to be hopelessly divided on law and order issues. Just look at the WA election campaign, for example. Two key Labor players have confirmed that WA Labor are telling the public that they are going to be tough on crime but -  - Two key Labor players have confirmed that WA Labor are telling the public one thing and behind the scenes they are concocting a different story. Julian Grill, a retiring Labor member, wrote in the Australian yesterday that the Labor leadership told the caucus that Labor's election promises on law and order were tough on crime but only because it was essential to win back government. - Mr Speaker -  - That is right. Mr Speaker, for the information of the member for Barton and other members of the opposition, crime and law enforcement are issues that are dealt with very extensively on a cooperative basis between the states, territories and the Commonwealth. The National Crime Authority itself is a state, territory and Commonwealth body and, as I pointed out in referring to successful operations, there is inevitably cooperation in law enforcement exercises. On that basis, anything that is said at the state sphere has relevance in the Commonwealth sphere. - Mr Speaker, I was telling the House what Julian Grill was saying. -  - He said that the Labor leadership told the state Labor caucus that they were going to be tough on crime in public -  -  - He said that the Labor leadership said it was essential to be tough on crime to win back government but it could be wound back when government was won. Yesterday on 6PR Brian Burke, the disgraced former Labor Premier - still pulling strings in the unions - backed up Mr Grill's comments. He said:Throughout this campaign he has provided some telling insights into the problems of a party split on important social issues.Both in WA and federally Labor are divided on the law and order issue, as they are on many other issues. Look at industrial relations, forest policy, tax reform - no-one really knows what Labor stand for. They do not have any policies and when they assert they have a plan you cannot believe them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. Last week a highly respected former Labor member of this House, Brian Courtice, speaking on behalf of tens of thousands of decent Australian unionists, exposed what he called a `climate of institutional corruption' inside the Australian Workers Union and the Queensland ALP, including vote tampering, ballot rigging and secret union slush funds. He revealed that one-third of the nominal membership of the AWU comprised phantom members who were kept on the union's books for the purposes of maintaining a stranglehold over ALP preselection. Brian Courtice said of `Big' Bill Ludwig, the Queensland Secretary of the AWU:He is an embarrassment to the party, and he is an embarrassment to industrial relations and to the union itself. The problem is that he is propped up on one side within the Labor Party.So this gentleman, described as the Al Capone of Queensland politics, is propped up on one side within the Australian Labor Party. The ultimate cause of this climate of corruption is the fact that the unions -  -  - I am quoting Brian Courtice, a very respected former member of this House, speaking about `Big' Bill Ludwig. The basic cause of this climate of institutional corruption is the fact that the unions own and operate their own political party and the fact that union muscle translates almost immediately into political strength via the ALP. These are the real issues. Does the Leader of the Opposition support Brian Courtice in his demand that Peter Beattie change the Queensland legislation to end the AWU's monopolies? Will the Leader of the Opposition follow Tony Blair's example of real leadership and end the union block vote inside the Labor Party? Does the Leader of the Opposition have full confidence in the integrity of Bill Ludwig, with whom he serves on the ALP's national executive? And, in the light of Brian Courtice's evidence, will the Leader of the Opposition demand that Bill Ludwig resign as national vice-president of the Queensland ALP?</DOC>

 - Given that most of that criticism has been generated by one man, David Henry, who certainly did spit the dummy, I do not consider it of much consequence. He has been round there working up his little left-wing mates, and they have been having a lovely field day. What I would say with regard to Mr Clear is this: most people would consider it perfectly reasonable, in a committee of 12 people, to have one person who has some understanding of industry. We have a person with a consumer background, and that has worked well. I think it is an insult to the other 11 members of the committee to suggest that having one person who can add to the deliberations and provide another perspective is a danger. I have no difficulty with Mr Clear. He is a decent man, and he is an honourable man. He is also a man that Labor was happy to have put on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority when it was in government. I am happy to have him on the PBAC.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question, and I would like to acknowledge the tremendous contribution that he made to the development of apprenticeships in his area in Gladstone over 15 years as a director of Abacus. He has a quite remarkable personal record.I am pleased to report to the House of the continuing success of the government's New Apprenticeships system. As of 30 September last year - the most recent figures - there were an estimated 290,000 new apprentices in training across Australia. This is 290,000 people in real jobs getting real skills. It is more than double the number of places that Labor could create while it was in office. In fact, in Labor's last year in office, the numbers of apprentices and trainees as a proportion of the work force were the lowest for three decades. The real question is: has the Labor Party learnt anything since then?We have the Leader of the Opposition's plan for our country - the size of a postage stamp - and the answer is: apparently they have learnt nothing. It is not surprising that this booklet is the sum total, the net result, of five years of Kim Beazley as Leader of the Opposition. It followed 13 years of failure as a minister. Kim Beazley never stood for anything; there are no ministerial achievements. When you think back, you can think of the Collins class submarines but where are the ministerial achievements of the man who is now the Leader of the Opposition? When he was the minister for training, there was a loss of 20,000 traditional trade apprenticeships in one year. In one year, he destroyed 20,000 apprenticeships. Youth unemployment rose to over 34 per cent. People remember the Leader of the Opposition for big deficits and record youth unemployment and for motherhood statements. This postage-stamp plan for Australia is not going to hide his 13 years of failure in office and five years of policy laziness in opposition. It is the Howard government that has the plans that are producing the skills that Australians need, innovating for Australia and for jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It is, like most of her questions, full of inaccuracies. The Labor Party cannot seem to understand the respective roles of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority. I in fact have a letter from the Chairman of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority, Mr Graham Glenn. I am a bit ashamed to admit I did not know what his name was until yesterday; I have had so little to do with the committee or with him. He points out a number of things in the letter, which I will be happy to table. Firstly, he points out that yesterday the member for Bruce did not correctly quote from the PBPA's annual report. Labor does have a habit of doing that. Secondly, he points out the process with regard to pricing. In terms of the first one, he says: Mr Griffin in a question to you referred to part of the PBPA's Annual Report. He indicated that it says 'that the main mechanism to determine initial prices for newly listed drugs on the PBS is the advice from the PBAC.'This is not what the report actually says. He says:I must point out that the report actually states:'The main mechanism to determine initial prices is the advice of the PBAC arising from the cost-effectiveness information supplied by the sponsor and evaluated by the PBAC'.He goes on:This is one of nine -  - Honestly; just listen, and you might learn something:This is one of nine factors the PBPA considers in making recommendations ...Here we have the Chairman of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority saying there are nine different factors involved in making a decision, and you are suggesting that only one of them is all they should take into account.  - You silly man. You cannot understand, even though you were Minister for Finance. He goes on -  - I am sorry, Mr Speaker. It was actually the Leader of the Opposition interjecting, and not you. He goes on to say:There may be some misunderstanding - you bet there is - about the responsibilities of the PBPA and the PBAC. It is a role of the Pricing Authority to recommend to you, prices for items listed as pharmaceutical benefits or recommended by the PBAC for listing. The role of the PBAC on the other hand is to provide advice on clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness which is taken into account ...In the case of the drug celecoxib, the PBPA certainly took into account the advice of the PBAC. You subsequently approved the price recommended by the PBPA. - The PBAC has no right to recommend a price; the PBPA does. Further, the question went on to suggest that I had somehow overruled or got involved in this process. I have a note here from the department that again I would be happy to table. I notice this complete blatant untruth is being repeated by the Leader of the Opposition, who in a doorstop this morning made the allegation:He has gazumped the PBAC, and there is a major question mark over why he did it. He then intervened in an unprecedented way. The fact is there was no intervention whatsoever, in any manner or form. The letter from the First Assistant Secretary of the Health Access and Financing Division makes several points. I am happy to table this too. She says at the end:While there is of course no requirement for the elected Government to follow exactly the recommendation of its official advisers, the Minister's recommendation to Cabinet and Cabinet's decision in this particular case followed the Department's advice to the letter.I am happy to table that as well. So this was a case of perfectly normal procedure where the appropriate committees had input and the appropriate body to decide a price, the PBPA, made a recommendation. Government took that - there was no intervention in the process before the decision or after the decision - and the great thing is that a lot of Australians are benefiting. Had we done what the Labor Party seems to be suggesting, pensioners would still be paying $60 a month for this medication. The only logical conclusion of what Labor is proposing is that, as a party, it would want to keep pensioners paying $60 a month for an anti-arthritis drug. I am not prepared to have that happen. This has been a great boon for consumers. It is a breakthrough medication; it is a whole new category of pharmaceutical. Quite frankly, we are very happy that we are able to provide it to consumers. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his interest in this matter. There are three sources of information that give us a bit of a picture of the impact of the new tax system on prices. The first and most comprehensive data of course comes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in the form of the regular CPI. The second comprehensive report comes quarterly from the ACCC. They do price monitoring surveys, and that gives us a snapshot of the impact of the GST on prices. Then there is a third survey: Wayne Swan's price watch, which gives us a snapshot of the impact of the GST. I am forever thankful to the member for Lilley, who must be off updating his web site now; I am forever thankful to the member for Lilley for his very comprehensive data.Members of the House will remember that we had surveys from the member for Lilley for February 2000, March 2000, April 2000 and June 2000 - and then they stopped after the introduction of the GST. Members of the House will recall that it was like extracting teeth from a goose trying to get the other data out after 1 July. We saw that August survey, which comprehensively proved that prices in supermarkets in the Labor electorate of Lilley were cheaper after the introduction of the GST. I was perusing the web site again and, lo and behold, the member for Lilley has now put up some more data, and we are forever grateful. He has put up data for October 2000 and November 2000.In his survey the member for Lilley covers 28 supermarkets, such as Franklins at Deagon, Bi-Lo at Chermside, Franklins at Quantong, Bi-Lo at Aspley, Woolworths at Deception Bay, Coles at Redcliffe and so on. When I perused these figures from the member for Lilley - and they are Labor Party figures; you have to question them - I discovered that, after the introduction of the GST, prices went down, and they still remain lower today than before the GST. In fact, the prices in supermarkets in November last year were lower than those in February last year. So, according to the Labor Party, prices actually fell for 12 months during 2000, and prices today are still lower at supermarkets in Brisbane than they were before the introduction of the GST.These are not our figures - these are not figures concocted in my office or in any other electorate. They are figures collected by the Labor Party. So it is a legitimate question to raise. If the Labor Party wants to roll back the GST, that means higher prices in supermarkets. If the Labor Party wants to roll back the GST, that means the average price of a basket of goods at the supermarket is going to go up. How else is the Labor Party going to pay for its policies? How else is the Labor Party going to unwind what it calls `the GST'? The classic words of deception come from the member for Lilley when he says that the average price of a basket of goods in June this year - that is, 2000 - according to the Lilley price watch team, was $99.14 and less than six months after the GST was introduced the average basket price returned to close to its pre-GST price of $98.53. I am happy to table the contribution. If the Labor Party was not so policy lazy, we would actually have a snapshot of what roll-back really means. But the only thing Australian consumers can understand about roll-back is that it is going to mean higher prices at their local supermarket. </DOC>

 - On 4 May 1999, the Commonwealth government concluded a regional forest agreement under the principles of the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement on scientific assessment and CALM reserve systems which, among other things, had the approval in terms of sustainable yields to retain and maintain jobs for workers in the Western Australian Environmental Protection Agency. Later, some reductions were made by the Court government, but I was able to identify where federal funding would maintain a process of no net jobs losses. Two announcements were imminent: building a brand new furniture factory in Manjimup based on resource from the Manjimup mill and a purchase agreement for the Nannup mill with a group of people who were prepared to not only keep the Nannup mill open but also expand its activities. Otherwise, the Nannup mill would have been closed with significant job losses. I had been awaiting final agreement on guarantees of a wood resource over an acceptable period from the Court state government to make sure that people's jobs were protected.Recently, the Gallop Labor opposition in Western Australia released their forest policy. They propose, over and above the circumstances scientifically assessed, of which I have advised the House, to take another 340,500 hectares of resource out of an area of 346,000 hectares. They say in their document that they are going to try to sustain the industry on 5,000 hectares of forest. If that were even possible, you can imagine the destruction that would occur. Talk about clear-fell! They would have to dig up the roots of the trees to have enough wood.As a consequence, some interesting remarks have been made. Firstly, Mr Bob Pearce, a Labor state minister under the Burke, Dowding and Lawrence governments and, to the best of my recollection, the environment minister under the Lawrence government, has been highly critical of these statements. He was quoted in the media as saying that this initiative will cost 737 direct jobs. He says nothing about the tyre replacer and nothing about the small business Retravision operator. He goes on to say that it will cost the state $84 million in revenue from royalties. I bet that is not in Dr Gallop's financial statement, which he got some mate over here to say is feasible. Furthermore, Pearce is also saying that even existing contracts - signed, sealed and delivered crown contracts - could not be honoured under this arrangement. Mr Tim Daly, president of the Western Australian AWU and an ALP state executive member, has also criticised this and was quoted in the West Australian on 23 January 2001 as follows:How can you tell your members this is a (Labor) government fighting for workers when he -  Geoff Gallop - is giving a kick in the teeth to a significant number ... There will be massive job losses ... in the South-West.Both Pearce and Daly directed timber workers at a public meeting reported in the newspaper article I just mentioned to vote against the Labor Party and to make sure that they got defeated. That message has to get through to the regional town of Bunbury. There are not too many sawmills in Bunbury, but I have visited the factories that rebuild the tractors and the bulldozers. I have visited the tyre sellers who have a huge business based on the timber industry, the people who service trucks, many of whom are in Bunbury and then, of course, there is that highly environmentally friendly Sincoa plant which makes silicon from jarrah charcoal and, one might wonder, even from the scraps. Where might they be able to continue their business which employs 123 residents of Bunbury?It goes further than that. We find that a one-time senator of this parliament and a one-time national secretary of the Labor Party are going to vote for a Liberal in this electorate - that was by personal advice to me. They are so fed up to think that they were members of a party which no longer puts workers first. Daly also said that Labor had abandoned grassroots workers for the chardonnay set. The only interest that Gallop has in forest industry products is a few ballot papers. I am pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition say, `This will get us a few votes.' The Labor Party is prepared to drive their own constituency into the ground. The member for McMillan will not ever come to me. Nobody does. The shadow minister has not complained to me about these job losses. The Labor Party does not care. Jobs can be sacrificed any time for a few preferences.</DOC>

 - On the first question, or assertion, I have no idea whether or not his name was proffered by industry to the PM. I would actually guess not, because I have to say that the only representation from industry I have had on Mr Clear was someone ringing me up and telling me not to appoint him; they would rather have had someone else. So I would guess not, but I have no idea. In terms of how his name came up, it came up at a roundtable session with my department in mid-January when we were looking at a range of names.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question on deregulation. I will first perhaps comment briefly on the interjection. Whilst I leave to you, Mr Speaker, entirely a judgment on whether or not what the honourable member said was unparliamentary, I can certainly confirm to the House that what he said was false. It is simply untrue, as members opposite would know, that the Commonwealth drove dairy deregulation.  -  - The reality is that it was state parliaments that passed legislation to deregulate their industry -  - The truth is that it was state parliaments that passed legislation to deregulate their industry. The Commonwealth parliament took no such action because there were no regulations for us to repeal. The regulations have always been put in place by the state parliaments. However, the industry itself went to governments, both state and federal, and asked for assistance to deal with the market forces which were inevitably leading to a breakdown in the regulations that existed around the country. They went to both state and federal governments for support. They came to the federal government and asked us to put in place a $1.8 billion restructuring assistance package. We have delivered on that package in full -  - The coalition government delivered on the industry's request for assistance in full; we delivered everything that was asked of us. However, at the same time as the industry went to the Commonwealth for assistance they also went to state governments, particularly in those states where there was a quota system for the supply of market milk. Those states are Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. They asked, as part of this restructuring assistance, that compensation be provided by the states to assist the loss of value of those quotas and the serious impact on incomes of those producers. Of course, the states with one exception failed to respond. The question I was asked was specifically about the ABARE report on the dairy industry which was commissioned to look at the impact of deregulation on dairy farmers around Australia. The report I think confirms very much the predictions that were made about deregulation prior to the decision being made. It confirmed that in states like Victoria - which is, after all, close to two-thirds of the entire national industry - because of higher world prices this year, dairy incomes will actually be higher than they were the previous year. It indicates, however, that there are some parts of Australia where dairy incomes have fallen very substantially. Some of the worst affected areas are in the electorate of the member for Blair and indeed in my own electorate. The other particularly seriously affected areas are in northern New South Wales. In northern New South Wales and in southern Queensland in particular, and in other parts of those states as well, there has been a very significant drop in farm income. It is perhaps significant that the biggest trouble is in those states where the state governments failed totally to respond to the industry's request for assistance in relation to their quota values. That loss of quota value has massively affected the debt carrying costs of those farmers and is the key factor identified in the ABARE report as to the reason why those farmers are facing such difficulties.I understand that the Leader of the Opposition is going to take the boondoggle bus up into New South Wales next week and that he is actually going to meet a dairy farmer. I hope that when he goes to dairy farmers he will explain to them why Labor governments around Australia have done absolutely nothing to respond to the industry's request for assistance through this crisis. Perhaps he could explain why the coalition government in Western Australia provided a package to support their quota holders through difficult circumstances. Perhaps he could explain why the New South Wales government ignored exactly the same request. Perhaps he could explain why the Queensland Labor government ignored the request for compensation assistance. He might also like to explain why the Labor government, even in an election campaign in Queensland, has not matched the coalition parties' promise to provide assistance to dairy farmers in Queensland. It is pretty obvious why there are serious problems in some sections of the dairy industry. Sadly, those farmers are represented by Labor governments that do not care about dairy farmers and ignore all their requests for assistance. I will be looking to the Leader of the Opposition to explain clearly to the dairy farmers of northern New South Wales why Labor has done nothing to support their producers.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The two press releases were put out because they are the only two occasions in four or five years that cabinet has made a consideration on a drug. In the case of Celebrex, we made a $215 million decision. Why would you not put out a press release when government has made a decision to put out $215 million of spending? It is absolutely ludicrous. With Aricept, we had made a decision that I think, off the top of my head, was of the order of $60 million over four years. Why wouldn't you put out a press release when you had made a decision for new government spending? No other items have gone to cabinet in that period of time, and that is why no other press release has been put out. If you have a look at the press releases, they are actually pretty flat and pretty bland. And, as I did say yesterday, Pharmacia is the lead company in relation to Celebrex, not Pfizer. - The Leader of the Opposition went on and made other allegations. It is true that Pfizer publishes regularly a series of debates on policy in the Economist. -  - As I recollect, other people who have been in the Pfizer Forum are Kofi Annan, head of the United Nations, and a pretty distinguished bunch of people. They want to stimulate debate on health policy. I know they have not asked the Labor Party, which is not surprising, because we do not have any health policy from the Labor Party. No, that was perfectly proper. It was distinguished company, and I was pleased and proud to be asked.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and congratulate him on the tireless work he does for his constituents, both in the electorate of Menzies and also here in Canberra. I also look forward to coming and seeing some of the small businesses in his electorate.Yesterday's announcement by the Reserve Bank that they would lower the cash rate by 50 basis points is welcome news for small business. The drop in interest rates means that small businesses are now able to take advantage of a business loan with a base cash rate of 5.75 per cent. It is good news for small business and it is news that small business has welcomed with open arms. In terms of their cash flow, it gives them more profit in their pockets and it gives them more cash to expand their businesses, if they so desire, which then creates more jobs.Since the election of this government in 1996, the coalition has delivered a sound economic environment with record low interest rates. That is in stark contrast to Labor.  - You know the story. I do not have to read it. Under Labor: record high interest rates - 22 per cent - high inflation, high unemployment and record high bankruptcies. Then you had a Prime Minister whose advice to small business -   - And I will read this, Member for Brisbane, so I do not get it wrong. This is what the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, told small business:If small business is feeling the pinch, they ought to say, `Small business is not for me,' because it is never going to get any better. This is as good as it gets.Wrong, wrong, wrong again. Labor was wrong again. It was not as good as it gets - things got a whole lot better when Labor got thrown out in 1996. The Labor Party knows nothing about small business; they know nothing about running an economy; they know nothing about setting a sound economic climate. All they know about is putting taxes up, about proposing things that frighten small business - that cause confusion, distress and heartache. Things like roll-back. Yesterday's drop in interest rates was good news for small business and I am sure that small business will not forget what will happen if the Labor Party ever gets back into power.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As it happens, I am aware of mistaken suggestions that the government have short-changed road funding by $2.9 billion through the Australian Land Transport Development Act and its special account. In particular, I am aware of comments from the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that the government have misled people and that we are trying to conceal something on this matter. The only person doing some serious misleading here is the Leader of the Opposition. He is the one trying to deceive people on this matter, because claims that the government are short-changing motorists on road funding are clearly wrong. There has been no funding shortfall for roads.As the opposition know only too well, the ALTD Act is simply one of the mechanisms used by the Commonwealth for road funding. Since 1991 a number of major roads programs have been moved out of the ambit of the ALTD Act. Actual expenditure by this government and by others on roads and other eligible expenditure, including on rail, which could have been funded under the ALTD Act have substantially exceeded the notional amounts generated under the ALTD Act funding mechanism. For example, the $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery package the member referred to, which has been so widely welcomed around Australia, has not been funded through the ALTD Act as funds provided are being channelled direct to local councils.In fact, since 1994-95 the Commonwealth has actually spent $2.9 billion, coincidentally, more on roads and related expenditure than would have been spent if we had used only the notional amount generated by the default rate provided for in the ALTD Act. I table a letter dated 14 February 2001 from the secretary to my department setting out the true position on this matter. This is $2.9 billion of real money on real roads for real people, not some auditor's technical accounting issue.Let me come to the issue of integrity on this matter. While the Leader of the Opposition may have floundered and fluffed on the issue of this act, the opposition spokesman on transport knows full well the distinction. At the Northern Rivers Community Economic Forum earlier this month, he himself was quoted as saying -  - Not who wrote it; who said it. Who wrote it? That is not the question. It is who said it. I am quoting directly from what the member for Batman had to say. He told the truth. He said:Look, there is no $2.9 billion that wasn't spent. It's an accounting issue.He then went on to say:You've got to tell these people the truth. It might be easy to exploit the issue and score points ... but to win the respect of people you have to be honest.That is what he said. Of course it took the opposition spokesman five days to come clean on the issue, but the truth has always been a commodity in short supply over there. It is a great pity that the shadow spokesman's belated honesty does not rub off on his leader, especially on the question of fuel excise. We saw earlier this month the Leader of the Opposition ducking and weaving and turning and waffling on the Neil Mitchell program on 3AW when asked directly what a Beazley government would do in regard to fuel excise. It finally came out in admissions that he would keep both the excise and the GST on fuel. That is what he would do. This weekend he was at again, this time with Laurie Oakes. Again he was asked directly what a Beazley government would do. Laurie tried three times but all he got was waffle. Even Laurie thought it was waffle, and he told the Leader of the Opposition so. We have this great exchange: REPORTER: ... you're waffling.BEAZLEY: No, I'm not waffling.REPORTER: Yes, you are.BEAZLEY: No, I'm not.The one thing the Leader of the Opposition does not want people to remember is that when he was in government fuel excise increased by 500 per cent.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition knows full well that we have had, and can demonstrate quite clearly that we have had, a real commitment to delivering what rural and regional Australia really needs in telecommunications terms, which is better service outcomes at more affordable prices and better repair times when things go wrong. In that regard, we have a proud record to tell. Indeed, just a few days ago we were able to reveal the outcome of putting out to tender our $150 million program for remote area coverage. Eighty per cent of the landmass of Australia - some 40,000 subscribers - now has a level of service that the ALP never even thought about. The results of the tender are absolutely outstanding, and calls within an extended zone or to an adjacent extended zone will be untimed at a maximum local call rate of 22c per call. - I seek to establish the very important point that it is not a question of your cheap approach to ideology here but a question of outcomes for rural and regional Australians that really matters, and the National Party and the government have a far prouder record to sell in that regard than you do. That is the point. To move on, what I have to say is this: we sought and put in place the Besley inquiry to establish, amongst other things, what shortfalls there were in the provision of services for rural, regional and remote Australians. The Besley inquiry, which carried out its task with a great deal of integrity, identified a number of areas of concern that need to be addressed, and our position is that there will be no further sale of Telstra until and unless those issues are fairly and squarely addressed. I cannot think of a stronger position in terms of what we need to deliver here, which is outcomes for rural and regional Australians. I want to close on this point: I have not met anybody out there who does not believe that your real agenda here is to sell Telstra.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, because I did see reports on the weekend that somehow pensioners would not be receiving the full value of CPI inflators on their pensions. Those claims, which are echoed by the Labor Party, are entirely false. As per usual, the Labor Party will stoop at nothing in its efforts to try to put falsehood out into the Australian community. On 1 July of last year, this government increased pensions, in real terms, by two per cent, which means that, after full indexation, pensions were nonetheless increased by two per cent in real terms. The indexation which is coming up in March would normally take into account the indexation from the September and the December quarter - that is, the indexation twice a year is always done in arrears. If we had not changed the indexation arrangements, the March indexation would have taken into account the September and the December quarter. We did two things on 1 July: we increased pensions in real terms by two per cent and we paid a two per cent indexation in advance so that pensioners would not have to wait for the price rises of September and December and then get the indexation; they would get the two per cent in July in advance before having to wait back until March. Even the member for Hotham, not considered a very reliable source when it comes to government policy, put out an information kit saying:The real increase in the pension will therefore be two per cent.So it was a two per cent increase - a two per cent advance on the March indexation. If this government had not reformed the taxation system, pensioners would be two per cent worse off in real terms than they are today. On 1 July, when the pension was then $372 - 1 July was not an indexation date - the government's arrangements increased the pension fortnightly to $386.90. So the $14.90 increase on 1 July, which was not an indexation date, was a real increase of $7.45 and an advance on the March 2001 indexation of $7.45. In addition to that, the government increased the income and assets test by 2½ per cent, making more Australians eligible for the pension. Aged pensioners with income from savings and investments became eligible for up to $1,000 in a one-off, non-taxable savings bonus. The pensioner rebate was increased so that single pensioners can earn up to around $14,400 per annum and couples $24,250 per annum without paying income tax and part-rate pensioners were given a more beneficial taper rate so that their pension was not withdrawn at 50 per cent for additional income but only at 40 per cent. They were real benefits to pensioners - paid in advance. When the Labor Party was running the CPI at eight per cent per annum, they never once paid an indexation in advance. When the Labor Party was increasing all wholesale sales tax, they never once increased the pension in advance. When the Labor Party legislated to lift petrol excise by 5c a litre after the 1993 election, the then Leader of the Opposition boasted about it. He said, `Oh, you didn't catch us during the campaign; we were entitled to lift it by 5c a litre.' They never once indexed in advance of the CPI. The government put that indexation in in advance and it increased pensions by two per cent in real terms, and any suggestion that pensioners are worse off as a result is absolutely false.</DOC>

I was asked what my personal view on timing was in terms of how long it would take to address the issues raised in the Besley inquiry. I expressed an entirely legitimate view that I did not think it could be done overnight. I was asked whether it was likely it could be completed in the course of this year, or words to that effect, and I indicated that I did not think it could be.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. The government announced a number of changes last week for the purpose of improving the simplification of the PAYG system, and also in relation to GST. First of all, individuals, companies and superannuation funds with a turnover of under $1 million can, if they elect to, under the PAYG system pay quarterly instalments inflated by a GDP factor which will relieve those people of filing quarterly returns. This will free up over two million taxpayers, if they decide to take that option, from the requirement of quarterly returns under the PAYG system.In addition to that, under the GST system we are introducing a new option for those companies which have a turnover of $2 million or less. The number of companies or businesses that have a turnover of $2 million or less amount to about 95 per cent of Australian businesses, so a new option has opened up for about 95 per cent of Australian businesses. I stress that, for those that wish to remain in the quarterly reporting system and have adjusted their systems and come to grips with that system, there is no need to change. There are many businesses which would prefer to pay actuals on the basis of a quarterly return. But those that wish not to do a quarterly return and are happy to pay estimates will have the ability to take the payment that they made under their December GST payment and to pay that in relation to the next two instalments in April and in July. All they need to do is file an annual return and, on the annual return, reconcile the instalments which have been paid against their annual liability for GST. It will mean that, if they wish to take up this option, they need not do further quarterly returns but do an annual return. In addition to that, the annual return need be filed no earlier than their annual income tax return or 28 February 2002, whichever is the earlier. That gives those businesses the opportunity, when they do their annual income tax return, to also do their annual GST return. They will have paid their instalments, the instalments will have been paid out to the states as the government is obliged to do under the Commonwealth-state agreement, and those businesses can settle up on an annual return.These arrangements have been warmly welcomed by the small business community. The chartered accountants, for example, said on 22 February, `We endorse the flexibility introduced into the new system,' and `Chartered accountants applaud government BAS changes.' The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, `BAS changes welcome. It is clear from the government's announcement today that they have been listening to the concerns of the business community.' The National Farmers Federation said, `BAS win for farmers and small business.' The CPAs said, `CPA Australia welcomed the Treasurer's statement on BAS this afternoon hailing it as a victory for small and medium-sized business.' I stress again that this is open to all businesses that have an annual turnover of $2 million or less. Those that are happy to pay actuals can continue to do so, but for those businesses that want to take up this option it is a very dramatic improvement, a very dramatic reduction in paperwork and I think it will be warmly welcomed by the small business community. </DOC>

 - The fact of the matter is the government took into account concerns that were expressed to us and we sought to do what any sensible government would do in the face of suggestions that there were some simplifications that could be made. We on this side are sincere about trying to ensure that small business has the best possible line through meeting what were very important needs in terms of tax reform in this country. We heard the concerns and we moved - I think, comprehensively - in a way that has been widely welcomed, to address those issues. We do not run away from the fact that there are some issues over and above BAS that are concerning people in the Australian community. Certainly, my own party, as we moved through regional areas last week, picked up on some of those, and I have highlighted what they are. Petrol is plainly one of them. I reiterate that we have done a great deal in relation to fuel excise, a great deal. Do you remember all the help we got from the ALP when we wanted to remove fuel excise on rail? Do you remember that? Then there was all the help we got when we wanted to reduce - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to be able to advise the House that, together with the parliamentary secretary, Dr Nelson, I attended the commissioning of two new Australian submarines at HMAS Stirling on Friday. It was an important occasion for the families after whose next of kin the ships were named - the Dechaineuxs and the Sheeans. I know the Sheeans are a Tasmanian family. That ship is named after Teddy Sheean, the first ordinary seaman to have a ship named after him in recognition of his heroic undertakings during World War II. The occasion was also an important milestone in the government's determination, basically, to fix up the submarines we inherited from the previous Labor administration, particularly the now Leader of the Opposition. Members of the House should be reminded of what the independent report said back in 1999 - the Prescott and McIntosh report. When talking about the deficiencies of the Collins class submarines they said, `We have been astonished at how many there still are some six years after the first boat was launched, the range and extent of them, the seriousness of some of them, the areas in which they have occurred and how slowly they are being remedied.' So said the independent report. As all members now know, the cost now being visited upon the taxpayer is literally hundreds of millions of dollars to fix up the problems we inherited from the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party and their failure to properly manage this important project when they were in office.   - This is an additional cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. The Australian people were told, way back in 1987 by the now Leader of the Opposition, when asked by an opposition member whether or not the cost would blow out from $2.6 billion to $4.5 billion, that:There will be no more funds for defence other than those that are being budgeted at the moment. The Government plans on that basis and the submarine program is planned to fit in with it.So he said back in 1987. Mr Speaker, you can imagine my surprise, when trawling through the Labor Party's current defence policy, to see that they have a policy commitment to two additional submarines. In 1987, when they were asked about the costs, they said there would be no additional costs, it would all be fitted in within the existing Defence budget. Eleven years later, when they issued their 1998 policy, they made a promise of two additional subs and, would you believe, they spun the same line that there would be no additional costs to the taxpayer as a result of that commitment. I have the policy here. The Australian public effectively were mislead about the costs and when we come to their policy today, here it is: `Acquire two further submarines.' In the four forward-years, nominating the additional amounts of money, it has nought, nought, nought, nought for a total of nought additional cost. This is Labor's Defence policy today - additional submarines, but it will not cost you a zack. This is the same story you were told back in 1987 but, today, we know, by independent report and by the additional costs which we will have to meet, that the opposition, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition, cannot be trusted with the taxpayers' dollar. It is about time we had a clear statement from the Labor Party - not the usual waffle, not the usual lazy policy position. It is about time we had a clear statement from the Leader of the Opposition about where the money is coming from.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question and acknowledge her concern for advancing literacy standards in her electorate. The government is determined that every young Australian who can learn to read and write adequately will do so. The appalling legacy of the Leader of the Opposition when he was education minister was that 30 per cent of young Australians could not read and write properly. As a result of the National Literacy Plan, which involves the assessment of every student in years 3, 5 and 7, we are now seeing the first improvements in literacy standards in over two decades. This year we have established a $1.4 billion strategic outcomes program which rolls together a number of existing programs to provide greater flexibility for states and schools to target the students who need most help. This is part of $9 billion for government schools over the next four years. This year also the national literacy goal that every child will be able to read and write adequately by the time they finish grade 3 will be embodied in law and given legal force.There is a dramatic contrast between the clear policies which this government has initiated to address this issue and the lack of policy on the Labor side. The Leader of the Opposition has never committed himself to national literacy standards. He has never committed himself to the assessment of every child. When he was minister, he sought to conceal the problem by suppressing the results of surveys which had been done at the behest of the unions. As an article in the Sydney Daily Telegraph said on Saturday, writing about what it called Beazley's policy black hole:The Federal ALP urgently needs its own economics and tax policy. It needs a welfare policy. It needs an education policy, and so on and so forth.This is not me speaking; this is the article in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday. It went on to say:Its front bench contains too many 'Labor Lords', union and party apparatchiks with no capacity to communicate with voters. The time has come to eject some of the grey men like Wayne Swan and Robert McClelland and the excess baggage like Cheryl Kernot and Laurie Brereton.This is the view of informed people about the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition has spent the last two weeks dining out on the performances of Geoff Gallop and Peter Beattie, election winners, but the man who sits on the other side of the table is Kim Beazley, serial non-performer, the man who stands for nothing, the man whose plan for Australia is an outsized postage stamp. As the Telegraph article said, `No-one has a clue which way Beazley will jump on any issue.' This government has given the lead on the most important social justice issue in education. Kim Beazley has nothing to say.</DOC>

 - It looks as though the member for Lilley has learnt nothing from being in the sin-bin. He twists the truth as much as he can, and we know that. We know that, aided and abetted by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Lilley wants to use the elderly as political footballs to make cheap points. The fact is that the Labor Party actually voted for this. In June 1999, you actually voted for the increases that went through with the new tax system. We stated that, on 1 July last year, elderly Australians, pensioners or social security recipients - particularly pensioners - would receive a two per cent real increase above the CPI and a two per cent advance for nine months. Did the Labor Party ever give an advance when they introduced wholesale sales tax? Did they ever increase pensions when they whacked taxes up two per cent or four per cent? Absolutely not.The government was very clear and transparent that there was to be a full two per cent real increase on 1 July last year, plus a two per cent advance. The interesting point is that this government also tied pensions to 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. Did the Labor Party ever do that? Absolutely not. That was an extra $13.60. The fact is that this government compensated older Australians for the introduction of the new tax system. That is something that you never did, silly Simon, in the 13 years of Labor stewardship. The biggest change is the age savings bonus. Over two million Australians have received on average over $700 - again, a compensation that the Labor Party never introduced. This government has given pensioners a two per cent increase, through a nine-month advance - and there will be another adjustment on 20 March where not only will MTAWE play a role - but also there was a two per cent increase, guaranteed in legislation, to stay ahead of the CPI. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Illicit drugs are something which the government has taken very seriously and is an issue on which the Prime Minister has taken particular leadership. Our Tough on Drugs strategy commits half a billion dollars over a four-year period to a mixture of demand reduction, supply reduction and educational programs. In demand reduction, $60 million is going to 133 community based treatment programs, which is a full allocation of the funds.  -  There are 87 community based projects on prevention initiatives, one of which went to Cabramatta at my personal intervention. - The $7.5 million has been going specifically to educational research projects allocated through the National Health and Medical Research Council. We will shortly be launching the largest and most comprehensive educational information program ever undertaken in Australia aimed at assisting parents in dealing with illicit drugs and what help is available. Four states - Tasmania, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia - have already signed up to the illicit drugs diversion initiative, something never before tried in Australia and a particularly progressive initiative. Those states will receive nearly $70 million in extra federal government funding. This all stems from the Tough on Drugs program released in November 1997. You could perhaps understand, therefore, Mr Speaker, that I was a bit surprised on Sunday morning to find the Leader of the Opposition on the Sunday program saying:We've had the Liberals adopt a portion of our drug policy, after ignoring it for the course of the last couple of years. Given that we released Tough on Drugs in November 1997, I assumed he must be talking about his 1996 election policy, so I reread it. How much do you reckon was in it about illicit drugs? Not a single word. There was nothing in their 1996 election policy on illicit drugs.Just in case I had missed something, I went to their 1998 election policy on illicit drugs and, true to their word, they had done much better - five lines, going to about 50 words, promising $3 million a year for an educational program covering tobacco, alcohol and all the range of illicit drugs. This is what we are being claimed to have copied. I am delighted that the opposition has finally released some policy - albeit uncosted, confused and waffling - on this very important issue. Far from stealing our policies, they are simply trying to catch up on five years of policy laziness.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the fact is that there is an attempt here to portray us as having cheated or gone back on our word in relation to pensions. That is not the case. As has been explained by the Treasurer and the responsible minister, there has been a two per cent real increase in addition to existing indexation arrangements and a two per cent advance on March 2001 indexation to offset expected price increases. It was well advertised, well publicised. People were told well in advance what the outcome would be. The only point to be made here when it comes to integrity is to go to the ALP's performance in 1993. If you really want to know how to judge the ALP, do not listen to what they say; look at what they do. In the 1993 election, we were promised endlessly that we could have tax cuts without a GST. We were told there was no need to increase the wholesale sales tax. We were told that there was not going to be any need to increase fuel excise. Of course, the reality was that, as soon as they were back in government and looked at the figures, they had to increase particularly indirect taxation very substantially. Did they compensate? Did they try to explain to the Australian people what they were doing? - A very good point. With all of that, were they able to balance the budget? - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I am pleased to inform the House that the latest ABS statistics show that the level of industrial disputation in Australia has now dropped to an all-time low. In fact, under the coalition government, industrial disputation has averaged just half the level of the previous Labor government. That is very good news for workers because, generally speaking, strikes cost jobs. I regret to say that developments in Western Australia show that, as soon as Labor politicians enter ministerial offices, the union heavies fan out into workplaces. According to the West Australian on Friday:Car loads of up to 30 union heavies at a time have been doing the rounds of sites, closing them and intimidating workers. A rigger on one of those sites is quoted as saying:It was intimidation. It was intimidation big time.It is going to get worse because the ACTU, with the full support of members opposite, is now taking its war against BHP out of the courts where it was and into the workplace. The problem is that Labor governments everywhere support industrial peace in theory but never in practice, because they are owned and operated by the ACTU. When it comes to caving in to the ACTU, the Leader of the Opposition has got more form than Saturday's race guide. He wants to go even further than his Western Australian colleague in abolishing workplace agreements; he wants to abolish the Employment Advocate who stands between workers and industrial thuggery. If the Leader of the Opposition had any leadership at all, he would emulate Tony Blair and abolish the union bloc vote. If he had any ticker at all, he would immediately tell Bill Ludwig to resign as national vice-president of the ALP. The very least he could do is condemn the industrial thuggery now taking place in his own home town. The Leader of the Opposition was the worst defence minister ever, the worst employment minister ever, the worst finance minister ever, and now the `minister for failure' wants to be Prime Minister. It just does not make sense.  </DOC>

 - It is interesting that the member for Lilley should ask these questions considering that his party helped vote on it. They voted on it in June 1999. It is interesting that they ask, `Where is it?' because I have the Age Pension News here - and I think over two million publications get sent out - for March and April. - Page 9 of the Age Pension News of March-April. You might want to read this. - David Ross is reading it. You would be better off spending more time in your electorate than masquerading down to Melbourne, my friend; but we will come back to that. Also, in the June-July edition - maybe I can read this, Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, because the Age Pension News goes to all pensioners - Opposition members - When was that? - March-April 2000.Opposition members - Ha, ha! - It has always been stated -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The member for Hotham was also extremely good at outlining to his electorate what the real increases were, and this was back in March of last year. I quote:The age pension will go up on 1 July 2000 when the GST comes in. The pension rise on 1 July will be four per cent, or about $7.25 a week for single pensioners and around $6 a week for each member of a pensioner couple. The real increases in pensions will be two per cent rather than the four per cent claimed by the government and the Democrats.Even they acknowledged it, and they also voted on it beforehand. The bottom line is that we made a commitment and we have stuck to that promise, and that was that we would give a two per cent real increase beyond the rate of inflation and, furthermore, we would give a two per cent nine-month advance to March, or whenever the next indexation point was - 20 March. We were very clear and very categorical. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro, who has been a strong supporter of Work for the Dole and of the many participants across his electorate. As we know, 90 per cent of the community support Work for the Dole as being a strong part of the government's mutual obligation policy and for how it is assisting people who are out of work to be able to get reconnected into the work force. In a recent article in the Canberra Times, Jenny Stewart, a lecturer in public policy, had some very interesting comments to make in support of Work for the Dole. I quote:In a study on the effectiveness of the Work for the Dole ... It was found that working for the dole has a positive impact on participants. They reported greater self-esteem, and improved motivation towards eventually finding a job.This raises the question, Mr Speaker, of why it is that those opposite continue to flip-flop about on whether or not they are going to support this system. - The member for Dickson says, `We are not going to support it.' There we go! From her interjection we know that they are not going to support the program. On the one hand they say, `Yes, we are going to support Work for the Dole,' and on the other they do not. When they can make a decision and stand up here at the dispatch box and tell us exactly where they stand, the Australian public will know what they are about.The fact is that not only is Work for the Dole well accepted by 90 per cent of the community, but also 80 per cent of job seekers support Work for the Dole. But it is not the only program that has been successful with the mutual obligation processes of this government. In fact, there are some 16 different opportunities, Work for the Dole being just one, that people can undertake to meet their mutual obligation requirements. It was only last week that I launched a new service - the Australian volunteer web site - which will allow the great volunteering attitude of Australians to be fully benefited, with great institutions across Australia putting onto one web site many opportunities where unemployed people can meet the mutual obligation requirements of this government and also assist themselves. It assists the community and also those groups. I had the great pleasure to launch that with the State Emergency Service in Victoria, which is doing a fantastic job.The lesson for everybody here, including those opposite, is that when governments support unemployed people, like we have, through initiatives like the Job Network and Work for the Dole, you see unemployment coming down. When you get the flip-flop of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Dickson, who continually interjects with nothing but riffraff, you find that you have no direction, you have no certainty for the Job Network, you have no certainty for those people on Work for the Dole - hence you find them wondering what it is that you actually stand for. This government is committed to the unemployed people of this country. Work for the Dole and mutual obligation are proving the success that we thought they would be and are, in fact, being well embraced by the wider community.</DOC>

 - The government has, of course, a very large number of very worthwhile initiatives in rural and regional Australia which are being rolled out, making quite a difference. I do not normally bring newspapers in here and I would hate to offend the traditions of the place, but I would like to make the point that today's Queensland Country Life does make a point: to keep things in perspective rural Australia should recognise the `long list of good things the Nationals have achieved for the bush'. Of course, rural transaction centres are one of those. There are many others. I could go on - whether it has been the economic fundamentals of getting interest rates down. I remember five years ago when we were competing with you and the Leader of the Opposition had been part of a government that had really decimated rural and regional Australia -  - I certainly will, but I just wanted to touch briefly on the fact that the reforms that we have initiated in rural and regional Australia are enormously valuable. We have also delivered a whole range of new service opportunities, such as the Regional Solutions fund, for which there have been some 600 applications and a very large number of successful, high-quality programs already funded.In relation to the rural transaction centres, it is in fact the case that a limited number only of them have been rolled out. They have been, if you like, progressed reasonably well where communities have wanted them, but a number of things have happened. Perhaps the most significant, though, is that in many cases now the private sector, recognising the challenge, has stepped into the breach with a very significant number of worthwhile initiatives - often carried forward with state governments. That is a good thing. I think it has been largely driven by the fact that we put a good initiative on the table. But the roll-out that we have put on the ground and the opportunity for state governments, local government and the private sector to have been very active mean between them that in many cases - as I say, I think this is a good thing  - there has not been quite the demand for rural transaction centres that we might have expected. Having said that, let me make it plain that, where we have put them in, they have been an absolute smash hit.</DOC>

 - I thank the House for the opportunity to state the facts in relation to pension increases. In March 2001, the indexation for pensioners would take into account the movement in the CPI for the September and December quarters - that is, whatever the movement in the September or December quarters under normal indexation arrangements, you would get no increase in your pension until March 2001. The government's decision when implementing the new taxation system was not to wait until March 2001 for an indexation in relation to the September and December quarters. We have said that we would, in advance of the March 2001 indexation, pay two per cent in advance - that is, nine months early. The original policy, incidentally, was to keep the pension after paying an advance of 1½ per cent in front of the CPI. It was only after negotiations and the changing of the package in the Senate that it was decided that the government would keep it at two per cent in real terms in advance of the CPI.  There was never any confusion whatsoever on that point. If the government had just given a two per cent increase, it would have increased pensions by two per cent and waited until March 2001 to pick up the September and December quarters. The government said it would do it in advance. That is why it has not been done a second time: two per cent was paid in advance and has been held for nine months longer than pensioners would ever have got it - something that has never been done before. This was explained in the booklets that went out before the election as a 1½ per cent real increase. It was explained in the mail-out after the arrangement with the Senate. In fact, there was never any doubt about it, because the old member for Hotham himself - a person who will misrepresent if he is given the slightest chink of light - put out a document which said:When will the age pension go up and by how much? The age pension will go up on 1 July 2000 when the GST comes in. The pension rise on 1 July will be 4 per cent. But from March 2001, when the pension is automatically adjusted for inflation, half the initial - that is the two per cent in advance - 4 per cent increase will be taken back. The real increase in the pension will therefore be 2 per cent.I table the member for Hotham's document. He is now trying to walk away from what even he understood at the time. The suggestion out there is that somehow pensioners have not had a real increase. They have had two per cent in advance of the CPI, and a real increase as well. It has never been done before in Australian history. There has never been an increase in advance of the CPI. And, in addition to that, this government said that we would even tie the increase by legislation to male total average weekly earnings if that were in advance but that the supplement would always be guaranteed to pensioners. If that had not been paid in advance, that $7.45 which would have been coming in March would not have been received back on 1 July; it has been paid since 1 July for nine months. So $7.45 has been paid nine months early. That was the two per cent increase in advance of the CPI factor in March 2001. These arrangements were fully explained. They are fully understood. - The member for Hotham says, `No, they weren't.' They were so fully explained even you understood them. - Even you understood them -  - and in an otherwise totally misleading book even you were forced to put them into writing. They are arrangements which have fully compensated in advance and led to a real increase. I say this to the pensioners of Australia: if the Labor Party had had its way, if there had been no tax reform, pensions would have been two per cent less in real terms. -  - If Beazley had had his way, every pensioner in Australia would have been worse off. This is the government that increased pensions and paid indexation in advance.</DOC>

 - The government over the last week has taken a number of decisions which are designed to reduce the unnecessarily complicated administrative burden that was placed on small business by the requirements of the business activity statement and the investment activity statement. I say quite plainly that the degree of complexity involved in those was wrong. The government regrets that, and the government has taken action to remedy it.</DOC>

 - Can I thank the member for Herbert for his question and recognise the great interest that he has shown in the peace process in Bougainville - and also, for that matter, in the Solomon Islands - and as the member for Herbert having encouraged the government to use Townsville as a base for peace talks on two occasions. And I thank the member for Herbert for his strong advocacy of his own electorate, and we have responded positively to him.I am delighted to be leading the Australian delegation to the 13th Australia-Papua New Guinea Ministerial Forum, and I welcome the Papua New Guinea delegation, who are in the House at the moment, led by the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea, Bart Philemon. We have as a government given a very high priority to our relationship with Papua New Guinea, from building personal relationships through to working very closely with Papua New Guinea on some of its great national challenges.We welcome the Morauta government's commitment to economic reform and its re-engagement with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We know that economic reform, whilst the right thing to do, is not always the easy thing to do. The Papua New Guinea government has shown great courage in its commitment to reform and has eschewed expediency in the interests of the nation, and that is something that on this side of the House we admire. We also are very pleased to see the commitment of the Papua New Guinea government to reform of its defence force. The downsizing and reorientation of the defence force is going to be, in the end, very much to the benefit of the people of Papua New Guinea.The member for Herbert also asked about the Bougainville peace negotiations. Clearly, our discussions today have included already considerable discussion about the peace process in Bougainville. We certainly congratulate the Bougainvilleans and the Papua New Guinea government on the Kokopo agreement of 26 January. That was a major step towards achieving peace in Bougainville. The talks in Townsville, which ended on Sunday night, focused on two aspects of the peace process: weapons disposal and the terms for autonomy for Bougainville. This was the largest gathering of Papua New Guinea and Bougainville leaders, including around 130 ex-combatants, of which there were a number from Francis Ona's group.After eight days of intensive negotiations, although there was no final conclusion reached, there was great progress made, particularly on the question of weapons containment and disposal. We are delighted that all of the parties to the Bougainville conflict are committed to the containment of weapons - that is, putting weapons into containers, secured and perhaps administered by the United Nations. This is a very big step forward. Let me just say that the Australian government will continue to do all it can to help the parties as they move towards another round of negotiations in Port Moresby on, I think, 8 and 9 March. Lasting peace in Bougainville has been an objective of this government, and we are proud of the role we have been able to play, along with our colleagues across the Tasman in New Zealand, in helping the Papua New Guinea government and the Bougainvilleans move towards peace. Many more people have died in the Bougainville war than have died in Northern Ireland since 1969. It has been a brutal and bloody process, and this government has worked very hard to try to contribute towards the peace process. Today has been a good day in Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea. We have built strong personal links with ministers. We have been very pleased with the progress of the Morauta government, and I think Australia and Papua New Guinea can be proud of the very close relationship that they have built up in recent times.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the Morgan and Banks survey. I am also aware of other surveys. Like any person who has been in politics for a long time, I see surveys which cover a wide range of subjects. All I would say about the excitement of the Labor Party about surveys is to remind them that these things tend to ebb and flow. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is trying to make the point that we are behind in the opinion polls at the moment, he is right. I do not think there is any argument about that. Let me say - and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition allows me to do so - that the government remains very proud of the significant improvement to the Australian tax system that has flowed from the introduction of the new taxation system. In so many areas, the Australian economy is stronger and better. Taxation reform is another reason why, when decisions come to be made by the Australian people, they will remember the 17 per cent interest rates, the 11 per cent unemployment and the $80 billion of government debt, which were hallmarks of the last time the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition had senior positions in a government in Australia.There is, of course, criticism of one or two aspects of changes that have accompanied the introduction of the new taxation system. One of them relates to the business activity statement; another relates to petrol prices. In anticipation that the opposition might not bother to ask me about petrol prices, let me take the opportunity to say one or two things about them. Everyone is aware that they are painfully high at present. Sensible people are aware that the high price of petrol is due overwhelmingly to the high world price of crude oil. I have been asked on a number of occasions whether the government is willing to make reductions in petrol excise. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition was asked about a windfall at the weekend. The reason why the Leader of the Opposition would not give Laurie Oakes a straight answer is that the Leader of the Opposition knows there is no windfall. Let me return to the issue. The government is currently examining whether there is scope to provide what, against the vast increases that have occurred due to world oil prices going up, would be very modest relief. The government is nonetheless examining the scope that might exist for that. We are constrained by the reality that next year's budget position, although still very strong as a result of the reforms and measures taken by this government over the last four or five years, is necessarily not as strong as it is this year because there is going to be a moderation in growth, of which the Treasurer and others have already spoken. We remain willing to examine what scope may exist against the background of those realities But I repeat: when confronted with an opportunity to make a commitment about an alleged windfall, in the words of the person interrogating him - Mr Laurie Oakes - the Leader of the Opposition simply waffled. The reason the Leader of the Opposition waffled is that he knows in his heart there is no windfall.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for the question. It makes me think of a fact which he shared with me when I was in his electorate some weeks ago that, when the government came to office in 1996, unemployment in Western Sydney was 14.9 per cent and that in December last year it was 3.9 per cent. I am not sure whether the member for Parramatta is solely responsible for the drop in unemployment from 14.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent, but members of the House would certainly agree that, being part of a government which has reduced interest rates and created jobs, he has made a stunning contribution in Western Sydney. We congratulate him for it.The ABS company profit survey for the December quarter was released today, showing that, in seasonally adjusted terms, company profit before income tax, interest and depreciation increased 3.1 per cent in the December quarter. Company profits are now 9.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Growth in company profits before tax reflected increased profits across a number of industries - wholesale trade and retail trade were up 67.7 per cent in the quarter. Similarly, there were strong profits in the mining and construction sectors, the mining sector in particular helped along, one must observe, by its export orientation and a competitive exchange rate. The profit share of total factor income rose to 24.9 per cent in the September quarter of 2000 - the highest level on record. That compares with an average under Labor of 22.3 per cent. Company profits, seasonally adjusted, showed good growth. The company profit share is the highest on record. As people know, mortgage interest rates are now as low as they have been in the last 30 years. For example, somebody with a mortgage of $100,000 is, because the interest rate was 10½ per cent when the government came to office and is now 7½ per cent, saving $3,000 per year. That is money in people's pockets.I was interested to see a very astute observation reported on the AAP wire today:Inflation is under control, there hasn't been a wages blowout, there hasn't been a mad credit binge, there hasn't been an asset price explosion and corporate profits are at historically high levels.So said Michael Egan, the New South Wales Labor Treasurer when talking about the benefits of the current economic situation. We would recommend that some of the federal Labor Party go around for a tutorial with Mr Egan. Some of their claims, which are absolutely false, could be corrected by him. The profit which has been announced today, coming with continuing good economic management is delivering real outcomes for real people, reflected in better job opportunities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. Members might recall that yesterday I took them back to the 1998 election defence policy of the Labor Party, which costed their commitment then and their commitment now for two additional submarines at a total of nought. In fact, for the four forward years it was nought, nought, nought, nought and a total of nought. These are the free submarines which come courtesy of the Leader of the Opposition. The shadow minister jumped to the defence of the Leader of the Opposition and said, `Minister Reith needs to do his homework.' - Thank you very much for that invitation to do my job. I was well ahead of you because we had in fact -  - I take the rebuttal seriously. - We sought from the Department of Finance and Administration some information about the processes followed during the 1998 election under the legislative framework provided for this matter, namely, the Charter of Budget Honesty Act. I asked whether there were requests made by the Leader of the Opposition under the act for a costing of his defence policy. Under the act, the requests are not made available to the government - they are provided direct to the department of finance. But we do know that the secretary of the department of finance, under the act, made a number of statements about the fact that he had received requests from the Leader of the Opposition. We also have, and I table the document for the information of honourable members, details of every response by the secretary of Finance to the request lodged by the Leader of the Opposition. In the event that requests are lodged very late and the department of finance has no time to provide a response in any detail, they are still to refer to the requests. So we have on the public record a fairly clear statement of what transpired during the election campaign in respect of costings on the defence side. I can inform the House that five times during the 1998 campaign, Labor submitted envelopes of policies for costings - submarines were deliberately left out of the five requests. I put a simple proposition yesterday and that is that you cannot have two submarines for free. This idea is from the man who gave us a $10.3 billion deficit, who was one of the greatest bunglers in the defence department this country has ever seen and who today has a policy which says to the Australian public, `Two new submarines - you can have them for nix.' This is yet another area where Labor has a policy but they do not have the leadership to actually tell you how they can afford it.</DOC>

 - Again, the question is premised on a falsehood and a falsehood which the deputy leader knows quite well. He works off the proposition that if you state something false enough times then people will begin to believe it. I have already dealt with the question of costings in relation to entity tax proposals. The $900 million that he has referred to, as I have already pointed out, was in fact a bring forward under the PAYG system which has actually been put in place. He keeps misreporting that but it does not make it any truer. The government in October of last year released exposure draft legislation providing for a new model of taxing trust-like entities. The government asked for submissions in relation to that and received many submissions pointing out numbers of technical problems with the draft legislation - in particular, the technical problems which could not be overcome, or were not properly overcome in that legislation, related to distinguishing the source of different distributions and the compliance and valuation requirements that would have been required.The submissions made the point that the legislation in its current form was not a workable model for legislation and as a consequence of that the government will not be proceeding with that legislation. The government will be consulting with business in relation to future proposals to ensure that when trusts are used for small business, farmers and the like, they can be confident in their business arrangements, but those elements where tax avoidance occurs will not be allowed to continue. The government has also discussed this with the Board of Taxation which has given similar advice and I can indicate that, after revamping proposals and changing concepts very significantly, we will be discussing that further with the board and with the business community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The cost of another couple of submarines would be in the vicinity of $1 billion to $1½ billion - probably on the higher side of that, obviously. It is a relevant question because we have a commitment from the opposition for an additional two submarines but we do not have from the opposition any idea of how they may proceed to finance those additional submarines and, obviously, this is a significant amount of expenditure. However, we do have from the Leader of the Opposition a commitment and endorsement of the government's white paper.In the sense of a bipartisan approach to Defence issues, we obviously welcome the commitment and therefore the certainty ahead for the Defence organisation in terms of what they can do and the equipment that they can purchase. It is a significant commitment the government has made. Over 10 years we are talking about $23½ billion, an increase in defence numbers to 54,000 and of course, as members would be aware, within that there is a program of acquisition, a very important capability for the defence of this country. It is a tremendous white paper and it is good that is endorsed by the opposition.But the fact is that today they have a policy, over and above the white paper, which is for two additional submarines. We are entitled to ask how they are going to pay for that because, clearly, one of the options for the Labor Party is to rearrange the priorities which are set out in the white paper. You cannot in one breath say, `We support the white paper and the capability acquisitions contained within it' but in the next breath fail to advise the Australian public how you are going to meet the commitments you have made. If you were to rearrange commitments, for example, in the purchase of maritime capability and if you were to switch that to these additional submarines, you would by and large wipe out the entire maritime capability purchases which we have signalled in the white paper.  If it is your policy, your secret policy, to rewrite the priorities established in the white paper perhaps you have decided that you will not pay wages for a couple of years in the Air Force! The only other alternative is that the Labor Party propose, in addition to the white paper commitments, to in fact find another $1½ billion, or thereabouts. I think it is a very fair question. There is no answer from the Labor Party on this. All we have are a few indications. We have the member for Fremantle, who said in January:You have to ask about those priorities. The government is prepared to spend billions in one hit in those areas you've mentioned.In other words, in response to a question about the government's priorities on Defence and roads, she raised the question whether or not they would in fact remain committed to those priorities which the government has itself outlined. As the Leader of the Opposition said in August last year:The major point I want to leave with you today is that good defence policies should not bounce around on whim and fashion.This country today for the first time has a clear plan ahead for the next 10 years - a plan which gives certainty and gives this country a defence force which will do the job. I think it is about time the Leader of the Opposition gave us a few simple answers as to how he is going to back up the policy commitments that he has made.</DOC>

 - The government is listening to the concerns of small business and we have accepted that there are some issues that we need to address. That was reflected in our announcement last week -  - You are the ones with roll-back. The opposition are the ones with roll-back, Mr Speaker. The reality is that confidence of small business actually increased by six points in the survey that you quite rightly referred to. Amongst those other findings, profitability was actually up seven points and net sales performance was up 13 points. But the member for Hunter should have checked his facts. Back in 1995, sixty-four per cent of small business people thought that the Beazley and Keating policies were working against them. I have got the graph here, Mr Speaker. Under Labor, at no time -  - At no time did business confidence in the Labor Party policies ever reach the lowest level of this current government. At no time did business confidence ever get to reach our lowest level, let alone our highest level. I table the chart.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. In the past two decades union membership in Australia has declined from over half to under a quarter of the work force, in part because of the growth of the services sector and in part because of the growth of freedom of choice in the workplace. Unions could respond by trying harder to persuade people of the benefits of union membership or they could try to manipulate the system to establish a compulsory closed shop by the back door or, indeed, a Clayton's closed shop. Last year it became ACTU policy to impose on non-union members a union levy set at or about the level of union membership fees. These are not service fees; these are compulsory union levies, because in the relevant workplaces workers have no real choice about their bargaining agent and, if they try to make a choice, as BHP workers found, the ACTU goes to court. Thanks to this ACTU policy to levy fees on non-union members, every non-union member in a unionised workplace anywhere in Australia faces a fee of more than $500 a year. Telstra employees in Queensland have already received letters of demand. Workers in more than 400 Victorian workplaces face receiving letters of demand. Ultimately, nearly six million non-union members in Australia face receiving a $500 a year bill from the relevant union. The Leader of the Opposition says that he wants to take the burdens off struggling Australians. I put it to him: how can he possibly justify this $500 union tax on ordinary Australians? How can he possibly justify a $500 a year union tax on struggling Australians which is set to create a $2.8 billion union slush fund? I call upon him to show a bit of ticker for once and repudiate this ACTU policy.</DOC>

 - I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to that question. The member for Barton has, I think, attempted to highlight some changes that have been going on in the administration of the family law system. I think the picture that he seeks to represent is not an accurate one. Let us get the facts straight. Some funding has been transferred from the Family Court to the Federal Magistrates Service. The Federal Magistrates Service has taken over a large part of the less complex work done in the family law area. In addition, there has been some reduction in the Family Court's budget designed simply to reflect the fact that they no longer pay wholesale sales tax on a lot of supplies. There has been no other reduction in the Family Court budget, so any changes that have occurred in relation to the administration of the court have other reasons. The Family Court has decided that it will to some extent cease providing voluntary counselling in some centres. Some of the centres mentioned by the member for Barton are those that are affected. What is happening instead is that those services, through arrangements made by the Family Court -  - and the Federal Magistrates Service, are being picked up and run by community organisations. Since 1996, it has been an overriding policy of the government to try to keep people out of court, particularly to keep people out of the Family Court. Where the issues can be resolved by primary dispute resolution methods such as mediation and counselling, we have sought to provide funding to community organisations. In the course of a number of budgets, the amount of money going to mediation and counselling has increased significantly.  - We now spend $30 million on mediation and counselling in this area and in the last budget $15.7 million was added. I have recently approved the use of $1.75 million of that to provide voluntary counselling where it will no longer be available through the Family Court. My department is working with the Family Court, the Federal Magistrates Service, the Department of Family and Community Services and community organisations to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure that voluntary counselling is available to a greater extent than ever previously - and we are achieving that. In addition, an amount of $1.2 million has been provided to the Federal Magistrates Service for that service to purchase mediation and counselling services at the areas where they provide circuit.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Our reforms to private health insurance were designed to give people choice and to take some pressure off the public hospital system. I am delighted to be able to inform honourable members that the figures coming through are enormously encouraging. Private health insurance paid for 428,000 admissions to hospitals in the December quarter last year - 41,000 more admissions than in the December quarter one year previously. Benefits for the calendar year 2000 were $3.4 billion - a record. In the December quarter alone, payout benefits were $908 million - $110 million more than for the same quarter in 1999. Perhaps some of the best evidence as to the success comes from the annual report of the New South Wales Department of Health. In 1999-2000, admissions to New South Wales public hospitals went down by 36,000 and, at the same time, private hospital admissions increased by 35,000. So you have here a shift from public hospitals - taking some of the pressure off them - to the private hospital system.It is 156 days since Cathy Freeman won a gold medal in the 400 metres. It was a great night, as honourable members will know. The nation celebrated and it dominated the headlines for days. Something else happened 156 days ago: at a doorstop, Labor released a policy saying that they supported the 30 per cent rebate. This was in spite of the Leader of the Opposition saying in Townsville, less than four weeks previously, `You know, I've never seen so many people sold a pup as have been sold one in this private health insurance scam that's being pursued.' That is exactly the same scam that, less than four weeks later, he purports to support. In that 156 days, we have not had a single press release, we have had nothing on the Labor Party's web site; we have had no elaboration of the policy and no real idea of what the Labor Party is thinking until last night. Last night, we had three of the Labor Party's backbench enlighten us on Labor Party thinking on the 30 per cent rebate. We had the member for Shortland telling the House about the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance, saying that the way the government bribed people to join and take private health insurance was a disgrace. We had the member for Throsby saying people had been blackmailed. We had the member for Shortland saying, `Yes, they blackmailed them, bribed them,' and then we had the member for Paterson saying: Another point I would like to make today is the gigantic con that has been played upon the Australian community by this government. That of course was the rebate to con people into private health insurance.So in one go we have three members of the Labor Party backbench, in a coordinated way, testing the water for Labor to abolish the 30 per cent rebate. The member for Paterson has 47 per cent of his electorate with private health insurance, the member for Throsby has 35 per cent, and the member for Shortland has 41 per cent. We will enjoy being able to inform electors in the electorate of Paterson that their member plans to take this rebate away from them. The fact is that Labor have no idea where they stand on this. They cannot take a consistent position. Quite frankly, nothing has changed. They blindly and ideologically oppose this rebate so strongly supported by the Australian people.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - I thank the honourable member for her question. As the responsible minister, I am happy to answer. The honourable member, I believe, is using figures that the Australian Medical Association have used. On recent records, it would be very unwise to rely on anything they have said. The simple fact is that, when you look across the whole range of medical services, bulk-billing levels are at a historically high level. Across all medical services, bulk-billing is more available today than it has ever been. In general practice, it is true that there is one specific problem; that is, for a long time the rebate went up by half the rate of inflation, and this has angered doctors. The reason that it angered doctors is that the government of the day promised that, when they introduced the Practice Incentive Program, they would not change rebates. In fact, the government of the day broke that commitment and indexed rebates by half the level. - So, if there is any challenge in the issue of bulk-billing rates for GPs, it relates directly to the issue of the broken promise made by the then government. This actually happened in the period 1990 to 1993 under the former health minister, Brian Howe. Then the Labor Party promised that they would keep rebates at the full level -  - and instead they broke that promise. Who was the adviser to the minister for health in the period when the groundwork was laid to cause any challenges in general practice? It was the member for Jagajaga. It is extreme hypocrisy to talk about bulk-billing rates when your own incompetence caused it! </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. This government has given great priority to expanding the opportunities for young people to improve their skills and their knowledge when they leave school, either by going on to TAFE or to university or by taking up new apprenticeships. The government has increased TAFE places by some 270,000 over the last three years. University places have gone up since 1996 by about 29,000 and, of course, new apprenticeships have doubled under the life of this government. Far more young people in Australia today are going on after school to improve their skills and their knowledge than was ever the case under the previous government. We have taken this action in part because the Labor Party, when in power, destroyed youth employment. It halved youth job opportunities. It also neglected TAFEs and apprenticeships. We remember that when the Leader of the Opposition was education minister he had absolutely no interest in the portfolio. He said:... I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining ... I thought that there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio ...The Australian commented at the time that the Leader of the Opposition's failure `to run hard on TAFE and training and kids and jobs has allowed the erosion of his position'. On university education - no tanks, no thanks was his attitude. He liked to be in Defence but, as we have heard, his performance there was pretty pathetic as well. On universities, he had a very clear position. He said:We're going to have to cap university expansion. We've got too many universities in this country.He said:The desperation to get into higher education is really misplaced.That was the Leader of the Opposition's view about educational opportunity when he was the minister. It is no wonder that opportunities for young people collapsed during the period of the previous government. In 1995, in Labor's last year of office, only some 50 per cent of school leavers went on to improve their skills through further education and training. Under this government, according to the latest ABS survey on education to work statistics, the proportion has risen from 50 to 60 per cent, a 20 per cent improvement in opportunities for young Australians to pursue the development of their skills when they leave school. Mr Lazybones over there, the person who is not interested in developing policy, who had no policy when he was in office, who has no policy now and who has no credibility on education, thinks that he can gain a few marks by empty rhetoric. But, in the absence of policy, in the presence of the thinnest, smallest plan for Australia we have ever seen from an opposition, the Leader of the Opposition has no credibility at all and this government -  -  - Well, that is all it is - `My plan for our country' -  - The Leader of the Opposition has no credibility at all, and young people in this country have benefited from our policies.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - Mr Speaker -  - This government is most concerned that frail aged people in rural, remote and regional Australia in fact receive adequate services which are viable. Accordingly, in the last round only a month ago, I announced 14,000 places. This was the largest round ever: it had to be large because the Auditor-General found that the Labor Party had left us 10,000 places short. It meant that we issued 14,000 places and $44 million of capital. I would add of that round that 44 per cent of the places went to rural and regional Australia. - Forty-four per cent, despite the fact that only 30 per cent of older Australians live in rural and regional Australia. I would add that, of the $44 million of capital, 74 per cent went to rural and regional Australia. We did that deliberately, because, in rural and regional Australia, they have less access to -  - the bonds and accommodation funds that we use for refurbishment of premises in urban Australia. It is very important to this government that we put emphasis on maintaining viability for aged care homes in rural and regional Australia. For that reason, we pay viability funding for smaller homes. In the last budget, Mr Speaker, you would appreciate that we doubled the amount of money we are spending on viability funding in order that smaller homes may serve those smaller communities. Far from there being the sort of policies that the Labor Party had in place when they were in office, when they neglected rural and regional Australia, when they were found to have left a shortfall of 10,000 places because of their cutbacks, both in additional beds and in capital funding, we have now remedied that by bringing on 22,000 places in the last year. And as I said, in the last round of the 14,000 places, 74 per cent of capital and 44 per cent of places went to rural and regional Australia to ensure that they get their fair, adequate and reasonable access to aged care places when they need them. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question and her ongoing interest in consumer issues. As the member for Dawson and other members in the House would be aware, there are three sources of information about prices. There is, of course, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the inflation index; secondly, there is the ACCC and price monitoring; and then there is the Lilley Pricewatch. Only one of the three is not credible, and I will come to that in a moment. The Lilley Pricewatch was released again in January of this year. It was a January survey, and the survey predictably claimed that prices went up in December and January as a result of the GST. A full six months after the introduction of the GST, it is amazing how the prices went up. The member for Lilley was so outraged about this that he said publicly that he was going to write to me and write to the ACCC for an investigation. I want to save the member for Lilley the price of the stamp - although I would have been keen to find out if there was any cash in the envelope! -  - This is good. Hold it up! Hold it up! - I referred the information available to the ACCC, and I received this advice. This is very interesting. Firstly -  - I asked the ACCC for advice on the -  - Mr Speaker, if I have said anything offensive, I am happy to withdraw it. I would not like to say anything offensive here.  -  - I referred the information on the Pricewatch from the member for Lilley to the ACCC for advice. The ACCC came back and provided me with three pieces of advice. Firstly, they pointed out that this survey, unlike other surveys, is in fact comparing apples with oranges. It has a smaller product base covering fewer supermarkets. So, on this occasion, it is not statistically credible. Secondly, of the 29 items surveyed, 28 were food items, which indicates a clear bias in the information and that it is not indicative of a usual supermarket trolley. Finally - and this is the clanger because, as the Leader of the Opposition was so helpfully holding up the newspaper before, the member for Lilley was running around saying, `GST pushing food prices up'; that is what he had on his press release - of the 28 items surveyed, 20 are GST free. Hold it up again: 20 are GST free. Of the 28 items in the survey, 20 are GST free - and the member for Lilley claims that the GST is putting up the prices of food! Again, the Labor Party lacks credibility when it comes to the hard yards of policy. Again, the Leader of the Opposition does no policy homework, does no research, and yet the Labor Party was taken seriously on this matter by some journalist. Some journalist actually printed it, when 20 of the 28 items in the survey were actually GST free. Once again, a policy lazy opposition.</DOC>

 - It is true that that is an issue which I have been examining, obviously, as the incoming minister, and given the size and significance of that particular issue obviously I am giving it careful consideration. You would not expect me to do otherwise, presumably. Perhaps after question time you might put out a press release and give us the benefit of your views on the subject and the Labor Party's policy position to see where you stand on the issue. But, if you ask me am I looking at it and is the matter under consideration, of course it is, and when the government has made a decision of course you will be the first to know.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for asking what is a very serious question, and let me say that I am frankly appalled at the frivolity with which the members opposite have treated this issue. It shows their total disregard for the health status of Australia's livestock and their disregard for agricultural issues. Foot-and-mouth disease is perhaps the most feared disease in world agriculture, and the outbreak in the UK, coming on top of the BSE and other problems in UK agriculture, is certainly a disaster that is befalling the farmers in that part of the world. Australia has the privilege of having been foot-and-mouth disease free for over 130 years, and we are absolutely determined to maintain that disease free status. It is a highly infectious viral disease. It can affect cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and deer. The member for Hinkler asked what Australia is doing to ensure that this disease does not come to Australia. Already, Australia does not allow imports of live cattle, sheep, goats and deer from the United Kingdom and, over recent times with the BSE scare, we have also placed a ban on all other products that are meat related. Therefore, that ban is already in place. However, we have taken a number of other steps to help ensure that there is no risk of this outbreak spreading to Australia. We have taken action to suspend imports of semen and embryos of cattle, deer, sheep and goats. We have revoked all current import permits for these products and we have suspended imports from the UK of any items that could perhaps remotely be possible of bringing foot-and-mouth disease to this country, including things like dairy products and meat extracts.The suspension has been backdated to 5 February, so any products on the water from that date will not be allowed into this country. In addition, AQIS staff at airports and other entry points have been alerted to be particularly vigilant in relation to travellers coming to this country from the UK. The outbreak in the UK does seem to be quite serious. It has now spread across a number of counties and also to the Isle of Wight. It is a type O virus strain, which is similar to the type that has been found in recent outbreaks in Taiwan, Japan and Korea. At this stage there is no indication as to whether there are any links between those outbreaks, but it is a highly contagious disease and one which we must always be vigilant to ensure does not enter our country. The government acted promptly as soon as we were advised about this outbreak. Australian farmers will feel for their British counterparts going through a crisis, as they are at the present time, but it makes us all the more determined to maintain our disease-free status in this country and to take whatever action we need to preserve that status.</DOC>

 - I think that the first thing we should recognise is that long-term unemployment is at a 10-year low. That is a result of the policies of the Howard government. The fact is that the classification scheme means that people do not have to wait some inordinate lengthy time before they can access services; they can access the services they need when they need them. This is a classification that we have been building on and will continue to develop so that we provide the services that the unemployed people need when they need them. - The member for Dickson asks, `What is it?' - I am not surprised at the question because the bottom line is: you do not understand the Job Network, you do not understand the classification tool, you do not understand Work for the Dole and you do not understand Jobsearch training either. - I understand, Mr Speaker. As I said, we are already delivering. We are not delivering one million unemployed, as the previous employment minister did - 11.2 per cent. We are delivering to unemployed Australians a rounded service which is providing them with job opportunities, training and work experience, and we will continue to do so. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Just to inform the House, as a result of the ministerial forum that we held with Indonesia at the end of last year in Canberra, at the request of the ministers in attendance at that meeting I have led an investment delegation to Indonesia, particularly to Jakarta, in the last couple of weeks. In that delegation we had the representatives of 16 of Australia's largest companies - in fact, representing about $80 billion worth of market capitalisation. Those 16 representatives of those companies also represented $6 billion worth of existing investment in Indonesia. The meetings that were conducted during our visit were certainly very, very successful and whilst we were there those companies announced a further $550 million worth of investment in Indonesia.I can certainly say that the relationship that we are working on rebuilding with Indonesia is going very, very well. It is interesting to note that Australian exports to Indonesia at the moment stand at $3.74 billion and that two-way trade currently between Australia and Indonesia stands at $7 billion. It is important to note, if we analyse part of that export effort, the importance of what flows to different parts of Australia, particularly to regional Australia. In the year 2000 Australia exported $144 million worth of live cattle to Indonesia, which was up from $17 million in 1998. Interestingly, those exports came out of North Queensland - out of the electorate of Kennedy - out of the electorate of the Northern Territory and out of the electorate of Kalgoorlie, and I am sure those members are very pleased to see those export statistics back on the increase to that level.Also in the year 2000, we saw $64 million worth of dairy products exported to Indonesia out of the electorates of Gippsland, Murray, Indi and out of Tasmania, and I am sure that the members representing those areas were very impressed to see those exports increasing to that level; they were only worth $37 million in the 1998 pre-crisis. Last year we saw exports of $86 million worth of passenger motor vehicles to Indonesia alone, which is a significant increase from the level of 1998 when they were only $6.5 million. Of course, they form part of that fantastic effort of the automotive industry last year where they hit a record of $4.2 billion worth of exports overall. Also, out of the electorates of Parkes, Gwydir and Maranoa, we saw $436 million worth of cotton exported to Indonesia. These exports, which we have seen dramatically increase in recent years as a result of the efforts of our government in rebuilding the relationship with Indonesia, are helping to sustain thousands of jobs - in fact, over 1.7 million jobs in Australia. That is one in five jobs across Australia and one in four jobs in regional Australia. The sound economic management that we have provided in recent years has provided the platform for these exporters to be successful in our regional markets. Of course, our program of taxation reform has certainly helped Australia's exporters, as we have removed $3½ billion worth of cost burdens off the back of Australia's exporters, allowing them to be more competitive in these markets. That was acknowledged by none other than the member for Fraser, who admitted:... the GST ... should be good for exports. ... I'm not a fan of the GST as you might imagine but if there's one thing that's a plus for it, it is that it should slightly help our exporters.And that has been borne out with the statistics that we have seen of increasing exports to Indonesia. I am not aware of too many alternative policies floating around, about which the member for Grey asked, but we did see something in the last edition of Inside Canberra. I do not know whether we should take a lot of notice of this, but the shadow minister, Senator Cook, says that he would resurrect the National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference, which the previous Labor government ran annually. We abolished that because it was a bit of a gabfest; it was held in Melbourne and it did not get in contact with the rest of the exporters across Australia. But it is something that Senator Cook wants to resurrect. We do not know whether we should believe Senator Cook, because he has not been too strong on the policy positions of the Labor Party lately. In the recent estimates meetings in the Senate, Senator Cook was caught out. He was talking about the Board of Taxation, and he said to Mr Smith from the Taxation Office:You will not have to worry about this much longer, Mr Smith. We will abolish it....			...			...I think such a body is highly suspicious ...But he had to come back to the Senate estimates meeting the next day and admit:... last night I said that we - that is, the Labor Party - would abolish the Board of Taxation. That is not the policy of the party and I now withdraw those remarks.So we cannot really believe Senator Cook on any policy matters, particularly any policy in regard to trade of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - It is true that the high price of petrol is causing a great deal of concern in the Australian community. It is also true that, as a result of the higher price of petrol over the last year, Australian consumers - Australian motorists - are spending money that they would otherwise be spending on other items that they might purchase. As a consequence of that, that substitution in expenditure is something that should be borne in mind in relation to the arguments that are being advanced, particularly by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in relation to the alleged windfall. I indicated in the parliament yesterday that the government is examining options that are available in this area. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition when he was finance minister, we worry about the state of the budget and we have no intention of plunging the accounts of this country back into deficit. I take the opportunity of saying that I do not intend that any government I lead will preside over a budget deficit. It is the policy of this government to retain a budget surplus. It is not the policy of this government to inflict upon future generations the debt burden left by the Leader of the Opposition. He left us with a debt burden of $80 billion to $90 billion. Not only did he leave us with that debt burden but he tried at every available turn to prevent the government from eliminating the debt that he had run up when he was finance minister. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we are examining the options. We are examining them responsibly. We are examining them consistent with our responsibilities to the Australian people in relation to the budget surplus and the impact of that surplus on interest rate levels in the Australian community. When the examination of those options has been completed, I will have something further to say on behalf of the government.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The health portfolio gets an enormously wide range of representations. In fact, I get about 50 letters every working day from members and senators alone, and pharmaceuticals is one of the main areas that I get representations on. In the last two years, I have had substantial representations on major new drugs such as Celebrex and Aricept. The honourable member also asked in the second part of the question: do people ever suggest to me that I should not take the advice of the PBAC? I am pleased to say that the answer is: this only happens very rarely. Most members understand that the minister is very constrained in his or her actions, that the minister cannot act independently and that, in fact, it would be quite improper of me to give a company a commercial advantage by making a political decision to put one drug on the scheme against the advice of my expert committees. I did say, though, that it happened rarely, not that it never happened. In fact, it has happened with a member of the opposition. Given the criticism that the opposition have had of the government because we chose to take the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority, which took other matters into account as it is required to do by law, it would seem unbelievably hypocritical that a member of the opposition could have actually written to me and suggested I not follow the proper course of action and ignore the advice of the PBAC - but it has happened. To be fair to opposition members, it happened with the drug Aricept; and, of the 87 letters I got from opposition members, it only happened once. It was only a single occasion on which an opposition member suggested that I should do something improper. For good measure, this opposition member also quoted the exceptional results of a drug trial that had happened in their electorate and suggested that the course of action should be to do something no minister had ever done before. Who in the opposition could possibly have suggested I take such a course of action? It would have to be someone who, first of all, was very silly, who had no understanding of health care, and who knew even less about pharmaceuticals - because they got the name of the committee wrong in the letter. I will give honourable members a clue: it is a frontbencher. Someone in the opposition frontbench actually wrote to me suggesting that I should ignore the PBAC's advice. I will read the letter to honourable members. It says: I am aware that the Pharmaceutical Benefits and Advisory Commission has recently decided not to place the drug on the scheme. I write to you to give consideration to having the drug placed on the scheme ... Then they spruik the drug trial - ... given the exceptional results displayed by the participants featured in the newspaper article. On the front bench, who does not know much about health care and would be so brazen as to write to me like that? It is the member for Jagajaga. The shadow minister for health, who has been up here criticising the government because we followed a proper course of action, has written to me - I table the letter for the benefit of honourable members - suggesting that I should do what she has been criticising me for apparently doing, which in itself was not correct. For good measure she spruiks a Pfizer drug trial. I have been in this House 14 years and I have seen some hypocrisy - but, boy, this takes the cake even for the Labor Party. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question, and acknowledge his real interest. The answer reflects the very positive move that we discovered on the railway station at Glen Innes in his electorate last week, where people were pointing to the benefits of higher prices for both wool and beef and to the fact that they are having a better run of seasons, which has been very widely welcomed.Yesterday's ABARE Outlook Conference forecasts for the commodity sector, and for the rural sector in particular, are good news for the bush - very welcome good news. That news does not, I hasten to add, mean that people in rural and regional Australia are instant or overnight millionaires. It does not deny that some people are still facing some tough times. But it is a sign that many communities have been waiting for, that things are clearly moving in the right direction.In summary, the outlook is that the index of prices received by farmers will rise 3.6 per cent in the year ahead, on top of a 7.5 per cent rise this year. We are likely to see higher prices for wheat, cotton, lamb, wool and manufacturing milk, and beef is expected to stay at its current very high and very well received price levels. Across the whole of the farm sector, farm incomes are expected to reach nearly $11.2 billion this year. That is up $2 billion this year, and that is a whole heap of extra money that will flow through rural communities and is very welcome. When that money flows through those rural communities, everyone benefits, whether it is the seed merchant, the fuel supplier, the newsagent, the grocery supplier or the shire collecting its rates - whoever it is. It means that everyone gets stronger support. It is a good and a positive signal, a strong message of hope for rural communities that have seen some pretty tough times. A notable feature of the Outlook conference this year that will give a further signal of confidence to country communities is -  and this is a very important point - that, for the first time in a very long time, farm prices are rising faster than farm costs. Terms of trade are improving. That brings me to the next very important point - which again people in New England last week were keen for us to acknowledge and to point to: the value of this government's economic reforms. What ripped the guts out of the rural sector under 13 years of Labor was that the export sectors cannot pass on costs - farm inflation at 13 and 14 per cent every year and interest rates two and three times what American farmers were paying. Those days are gone.  - I hear an interjection from the would-be Treasurer. `Oh,' he says, `I suppose you will claim the GST is helping as well.' Well, you know what? You are dead right - I am. It is helping. Peter Cook, your own minister, said it would - and it is. People who understand agribusiness are saying that one of the things that is improving the terms of trade for Australian exporters is our tax reform. Let there be no mistake about that: tax reform is helping rural and regional Australia. This is the tax reform that Labor fought at every turn, at every step, and the tax reform that they are still committed to rolling back. So country people - beware. Just be aware that you now have an understanding of what Labor wants to roll back. It wants to roll back farm incomes. It wants to roll back the competitiveness of Australia's export industries. It wants to roll back opportunities in the bush.</DOC>

 - The Prime Minister has been asked before, as have I, about this so-called tax windfall that the Labor Party keeps going on about. The truth of the matter in relation to petrol excise, as the mid-year review showed, is that the collection in relation to petrol excise was down because volumes were down. Petrol excise is at a fixed cents per litre rate and petrol excise actually declines -  - As I previously explained to the House, petrol excise, which is at a fixed cents per litre rate - now at about 39c - does not go up as the price goes up and the petrol excise collections actually fall as volumes fall. As the media review showed, because world oil prices have been high, the petrol excise had in fact fallen. The Prime Minister has also said that the goods and services tax is something that works off consumption. What governs the overall collection in relation to goods and services tax is overall consumption. It does not matter if consumption moves from one area to the other; the overall consumption tax, which is one-eleventh, is the same amount.Anybody who is familiar with a taxation system would know that to be the case. The Australian Labor Party is not familiar with taxation matters and obviously does not understand it. I was rather intrigued this morning when we had one of those trade union tirades that we get from the member for Hotham every now and then on the radio. He could have been talking direct from the waterfront - he was screaming down the microphone. He started off his interview by saying, in relation to petrol, that there was a huge windfall and then finished up, in relation to his comment on trusts, by saying that we were driving the budget into deficit. When he switches the little switch in his brain to petrol there is a huge windfall, but when he switches the little switch in his brain to trusts there is a risk of a deficit. The truth of the matter is that the switch in his brain is mostly switched off and the mouth operates independently. He will, in the course of one interview, hold two absolutely mutually inconsistent positions, and do you know what? He is wrong in relation to both of them. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because, also during the trade union tirade this morning from the former president of the ACTU, we had this claim in relation to trusts. Remember, on the one hand there is a huge budget windfall but in relation to trusts we had this claim: What it is doing to the budget surplus is the real problem; this is a government prepared to blow the budget surplus. I thought to myself that that is an interesting thing for a shadow Treasurer to say, because I have been a shadow Treasurer. I used to do radio interviews when I was shadow Treasurer and the Labor Party was in office. The phrase that I never used as shadow Treasurer was what the Labor Party was prepared to do to a budget surplus. I never once had the opportunity to talk about what the Labor Party would do with a budget surplus. There never was one. In the last five years that I was the shadow Treasurer, there was never a budget surplus produced by the Labor Party. - He interjects that we were in the middle of a worldwide recession. In 1995-96 -  -  - He interjects that we were in the middle of a worldwide recession. In 1995-96, the Australian economy grew at four per cent. In fact I saw a ghost of years past writing in the Financial Review this morning. -  - They say he was good, do they - their hero? - In 1995-96 when the Australian economy was growing at four per cent plus and the finance minister was none other than the Leader of the Opposition, the budget deficit was $10,077 million - not in surplus; in deficit by $10,077 million. The year before that, the budget was in deficit by $13 billion; the year before that the budget was in deficit by $17 billion; the year before that the budget was in deficit by $17 billion; and the year before that the budget was in deficit by $11 billion. During all that period, the now member for Hotham was a minister in a Labor government which produced five record deficits in a row. And he goes out there and he says that he is now concerned about surpluses. Let us have a look at the coalition record. We took a $10 billion deficit in 1995-96 and we halved it the next year. The next year in 1997-98 we produced a $1 billion surplus, the next year a $4 billion surplus, the next year a $12 billion surplus and this year, after giving tax relief to all Australian income taxpayers, a projected $4 billion surplus. And we hear the member for Hotham going out there and talking about surpluses. This is the Labor Party that are totally opposed to GST - but they are going to keep it; totally opposed to the private health insurance rebate - but they are going to keep it; totally opposed to the changes on education reform - but they are going to keep them; totally opposed to work for the dole - but they are going to keep it. They have never produced a surplus and they are now in favour of surplus budgets. The ALP should be renamed the `Australian Lazy Party' - never produced a budget surplus and now they are in favour of huge surpluses.  - The Leader of the Opposition goes out now as the Leader of the Australian Lazy Party, and says, `They're going to pinch my policies; they're adopting my policies.' Honourable members - Oh, he's got the card! - We are adopting his policies! I am glad it is in big print because it would not have got -  - This is the government that has done all the hard work to put the budget into surplus. To hear a trade union tirade of concern about budget surpluses after a record of $11 billion, $17 billion, $17 billion, $13 billion and $10 billion deficits is to hear somebody who will say and do anything but whatever he says, it is bound to be wrong.An incident having occurred in the gallery - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. So far as I am aware, the levy that we have collected has been deployed for the purposes for which we collected it. I will have that confirmed and come back to him. I am glad he asks about the issue of the government's overall aviation policy and safety in general. I notice that he has been a frequent critic out there on the airwaves and his asking me a question, which he does not do very often, gives me the opportunity to point to something that I really would like draw the House's attention to. A recent overseas study, which was referred to in a recent speech at a Press Club luncheon by the director of aviation safety, made the very interesting observation that Ansett is the second safest airline in the world, Qantas comes in third - Air Canada being the first - and that the latest ATSB figures show that the number  of aviation accidents last year was 27 per cent lower than the figure for - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and I acknowledge her real interest in defence matters. The defence white paper has a balanced approach to the maritime force - which you have asked about - as well as to the Air Force and the Army. But, just looking at the maritime side, the defence white paper sets out a plan for us to acquire some of the capability that we need for our defence forces. It is why the Defence Force plan has been so widely received as the best blueprint we have seen for the Defence Force in decades. It is a great tribute to the Prime Minister and the former minister that they provided the direction to establish our defence forces on this sustainable basis. One of the important replacement programs will be the acquisition of patrol boats to replace the existing Fremantle class patrol boats. That is important obviously from a defence point of view and from the point of view that we will contract out some of the capability as patrol boats for immigration and related activities for Coastwatch. That will be a very welcome part of the new defence white paper. Secondly, we have substantial upgrades to existing surface combatants - the FFGs and the Anzac frigates, and that is a very worthwhile project in itself. In addition, because of the expense and the complexity of some of these new big equipment items, we have set out a plan and a process for the acquisition into the following decade of three air warfare destroyers which will replace the guided missile frigates after they leave service from 2013. Because we have set out a clear plan of acquisitions, particularly in the shipbuilding area, we are giving the shipbuilding industry a framework within which they know they will be able to operate and provide those ships in a reliable manner. That is very good for the shipbuilding industry and the reason that has wider implications is that there are a lot of jobs associated with shipbuilding. The government has a strong preference for building new ships in Australia and that is therefore very good news generally for the economy. This is a white paper and thus a plan which will hold Australia in good stead literally for decades to come. I welcome the fact that the opposition have repeatedly endorsed the white paper. That is good in itself but, as the parliament has question time today, there is a question mark over the Labor Party's policy position because, as I revealed this week, they have another additional policy commitment and that is for two free submarines. It is a fair question to ask: where are you going to get the money? The shadow minister was up for 20 minutes last night and he did not give us an answer. I am indebted to the Leader of the Opposition who, through interjection this morning, I think said that back in 1998 they were going to pay for them by reordering priorities. But you cannot reorder priorities today when you have signed up to the white paper. I am sorry I will not be here tomorrow but I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the shadow minister that I will be back on Monday and on Monday I would like you to tell me how you are going to pay for the two new subs. </DOC>

 - The government produced a draft piece of legislation and called for submissions in relation to it. I pulled out the submissions today - I think there were 65 - and I think it would be fair to say that out of 65 submissions, 65 pointed out potential problems with the legislation. But I am asked whether I would work with Labor to fix the legislation. I asked how many of those 65 submissions had been submitted by the Australian lazy party and, Mr Speaker, it was not one. There was no interest in the matter. It did not even put in a submission. It is unable to come to grips with any of the issues involved and now it sits back and says, `Will you work with the Australian Labor Party?' It is very hard to work with the Australian Labor Party because the Australian Labor Party does not work. It does not do the work. It will not produce the policies. It runs around here with cheap slogans but the last thing it is capable of doing is having a credible policy. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. I pay tribute to the work that he has done on behalf of his constituents. He draws my attention to a survey which has recently been released by Pitcher Partners and Monash University. It is not a survey that I have previously been familiar with, but it was released yesterday under the heading `Survey turnaround: business confidence on the rise as GST support jumps'. This is a survey of family businesses which showed a jump in support, as reported by Monash University and Pitcher Partners, for the GST. The survey also showed that more than 87 per cent of family businesses are confident that they filled out the BAS accurately. It notes that that means there are 12.5 per cent that are not confident, and it is in relation to those 12.5 per cent that there are now new arrangements being put in place. I reiterate those arrangements.For any business which has a turnover of $2 million or less, they now have the option of taking their December payment and making that as their payment for April and July. They will then have to file an annual return and the annual return, which will assess their liability, will be set off against the instalments which have been made. If they believe for some reason or another that the December payment is not an applicable one to their trading conditions, they can vary in relation to the April and July payments. That means that if you are a business that has a turnover of $2 million or less - I believe this applies to 95 per cent of Australian businesses - you need not fill out a further quarterly report. You can do an annual report which is filed at the time of the annual income tax statement or February 2002, whichever is the earlier. I point out that those businesses which are confident with the current system and which prefer to pay their actual amounts can continue filing the quarterly return without any changes. Yesterday we were also referred to the Yellow Pages index in relation to small business, which also, as I recall it, showed a jump in conditions in small business. In relation to GST - I did not get the chance to refer to this yesterday - when small businesses were asked, `As far as your business is concerned, what problems are you facing at the moment?' the largest proportion, 26 per cent, said none, the second largest, 20 per cent, said lack of work and the third largest, 14 per cent, said government regulation, state. The GST was named by three per cent, which was the smallest number of people who cited it as a concern. So obviously as people have become more familiar with the system the level of concern in relation to that has dropped. Those surveys do not, I believe, take into account the full measure of the announcements in relation to simplification. For those who want to take that simplification up, that will be an additional improvement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Calwell for his question. What I have said, and I repeat it in answer to the question, is that the overwhelming reason for the sharp increase in the price of petrol in Australia over the past 18 months has been due to the increase in the crude oil price, and that is an undeniable fact. So far as the oil companies and parity pricing are concerned, parity pricing was introduced by the Fraser government in the late 1970s. It was a policy that was retained in the 13 years that the Hawke and Keating governments were in power, and, as I understand it, substantially in terms of the approach that we have adopted since this government came to office. I am interested in any practical suggestions that the honourable member for Calwell has in relation to the behaviour of the oil companies. I do not carry a brief for any corporation in this country. If on the other hand the honourable member for Calwell has any particular proposals in relation to the oil companies, he might let me have them. In the process of letting me have them, he might bear in mind the policies that were pursued by the government to which he gave support for a long period - I forget whether it was for 13 years, but it was a substantial part of that time - and the policies that continue to be pursued by the party that occupies most of the benches on the side of the House on which he sits. In other words, you will not solve the problem of high petrol prices by cheap questions; you will solve the problem of high petrol prices only by seeing something done about the high price of crude oil.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The good news in the forecast by ABARE yesterday is obviously going to be well received in the member for Hume's electorate. ABARE has forecast that total commodity exports are set to rise in the next 12 months by about 3½ per cent. On the back of some very good figures over the last couple of years, it is forecast that total commodity exports are going to rise from $86.3 billion to $89.3 billion, farm sector exports are going to rise from $24.2 billion to $27.5 billion in the next 12 months and mining sector exports are going to rise from $44.4 billion to $54.9 billion in the next 12 months. This is good news for the commodity sector of our economy. Export growth is driving our economy. Along with those statistics, manufacturing exports will continue to grow at around 12 per cent. Off the back of a very successful outcome from the Olympic Games held in Australia last year - we saw a surplus in the trade in services last year, a lot to do with the success of the Olympics - it sets a very good scene for Australia's export effort. One of the more important outcomes of the trade effort last year was that we halved the trade deficit from $16.5 billion to $7.3 billion as a result of a lot of the activities that were undertaken by Australia's exporters, and certainly that was being driven along by the good sound economic management of our government.We have seen a lot of investment in the export sector of the Australian economy, which has helped. We do not deny that the exchange rate helps exports, but fundamental to a lot of the effort that has been undertaken has been sound economic management, the reform programs that we have undertaken and the removal of a lot of the tax burden from Australia's exporters. That makes them much more competitive in the international marketplace. That is an undeniable fact. We aim to continue to work with Australia's exporters to get them into new world markets and increase their presence in those markets. The sound economic management of the Australian economy has certainly laid the foundation for the forecasts outlined by ABARE yesterday as far as the future of our economy is concerned. The forecasts were underpinned by some comments made at the ABARE Outlook Conference yesterday by Mr Malcolm Edey, head of economic research at the Reserve Bank, who said:(1) There is little sign of the sorts of imbalances that have curtailed growth in the past.(2) Wage growth has remained moderate.(3) Business profitability coming into the second half of 2000 was high.(4) Interest rates have remained relatively low.(5) Inflation in underlying terms is well contained.(6) The Australian economy seems as well placed as could be hoped to weather a shift in international conditions.That is a very strong signal to the Australian economy and Australian exporters for the future. The forecast of growth in exports is very good news for the commodity sector and for the broader exporting community in Australia. The only threat to that is the likelihood of a Labor government that would roll back a lot of the sound economic management principles that we have implemented over the last number of years and reimpose taxes on the export sector that the government has taken away, making Australian exporters so much more competitive in the international marketplace.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and the first thing that I would say is that the issue of dairy deregulation is not one that I or anyone on this side of the House take lightly. There are several points that I will take the opportunity to establish. The first is that this is not a result per se of competition policy or of some ideological pursuit of a position by the government. It is very important that that be established. The second point that I would want to make is that the reality is that, ever since the so-called `Kerin plan' days, it has been known that sooner or later Victorians in particular -  - would want to exercise their right under the Constitution to trade freely in other parts of the country. Indeed, the first milk out of Victoria - three tanker loads of it - reached the Sydney market in the mid-1980s. In those circumstances, it was evident that a very real challenge was going to confront the dairy industry - one that was not taken up and addressed by the ALP, even though, towards the end of their time in government, it was very obvious that planning would have to be done. Shortly after the change of government, dairy industry leadership in this country came to me and indicated that there were some big challenges coming up and that they wanted to work with the government to help them through those challenges. We set out to do just that. We put in place a $1.8 billion package to help the industry through what we knew would be, and what is proving in some parts of the country to be, a very difficult exercise - not one that we make light of at all.There is another point I would like to make on this, though. People seem to want to decry what the Commonwealth has done, and your question, by its very nature, implies that somehow we have not been sympathetic to the industry or tried to help. The fact is that we have put in place the biggest structural adjustment package -  - I want to come to a very important point here, because it is so typical of the rhetoric we hear from those opposite when they cry their crocodile tears over what is happening in rural and regional Australia. What have ALP governments across this country done for the dairy industry?Government members - Nothing! - Nothing! There was just one state government that did anything whatsoever to help the dairy industry, and it was the Western Australian coalition. The Labor government in Victoria - nothing! The Labor Party in New South Wales - nothing! The Labor Party in Queensland - nothing! When the Leader of the Opposition in this House -   - this new-found champion of rural and regional Australia - went out there in the boondoggle bus -  - out there on the boondoggle bus on roads that we built, that they did not want built - he did not leave the Pacific Highway; he did not go and have a look at the local roads - was asked about dairy deregulation, what did he do? He made a lot of nice comforting noises which amounted to nothing more than waffle. Just talk! If you want them to believe out there that you actually have some sort of way forward, you will have to do a lot more than just talk.The issue raised about the timeliness has been of concern. I know that the minister is seeking to do all that he can to facilitate the implementation of the only assistance package in town, put together in full consultation with the industry - not matched by any Labor administration in the country -  - You do not have a leg to stand on on this. Your words are absolutely hollow. They are trite and they are hollow. We are working with the industry. I am talking to Warren Truss, to the leadership of the industry and to the Prime Minister about how we take forward their concerns. Again I note, though, there has not been one whit of cooperation or hint of help or even of understanding from a single Labor government in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. The government is seeking a $10 a week rise for low paid workers at the safety net -  - We are seeking a $10 a week pay rise for low paid workers at the safety net wage case currently before the Industrial Relations Commission, as opposed to the $8 a week rise regularly sought by the Keating government. I would be the first to concede that $10 does not sound like a lot for someone on the minimum federal award of just $400 a week, but the truth is that increases in the social safety net can actually make a much bigger difference -  - for low-paid workers than wage rises. For instance, someone on $400 a week in wages with a dependent spouse and two dependent children will have, depending on their ages, a total disposable income of $566 a week thanks to the social security system. This is up more than $50 a week on 30 June last year thanks to the new tax system. Thanks to the new tax system, this person is $50 a week better off.  - Wage rises of between $28 and $53 a week, as proposed by the ACTU, sound generous but they will cost jobs. They will cost an estimated 45,000 jobs, and the biggest cause of poverty in this country is unemployment. Members opposite say that they want to see higher wages, but on this subject they have form. Basic award wages fell in real terms by five per cent during the life of the former government; under this government they have increased by nine per cent. Average weekly earnings were virtually stagnant under the former government; under this government they have increased by 12 per cent. Members opposite actually boasted about reducing the real wages of ordinary workers. For instance, the former Prime Minister Mr Hawke said:It should be remembered that the fall in real wages has not occurred by accident; it has occurred as a result of, and it flows from, the accord that has been reached between the Labor Government and the trade union movement of this country. Members opposite were responsible for massive falls in real wages. The member for Hotham, when he was ACTU president, said:... we've almost made a virtue of the fact that what this system has produced is falls in real wages. Australians need higher wages and higher employment, and they can have both thanks to the greater freedom and flexibility in the workplace, which is precisely what this government is delivering.</DOC>

 - Again, I thank the honourable member for his question and make the observation that it would be very useful for the purposes of the debate if he actually understood what he was talking about. Let us have a little historical perspective on this. Firstly, when the dairy industry initially approached me - and it was me that they initially approached; they subsequently worked with other ministers - they estimated that the adjustment package ought to be of the order of $1.4 billion. When we worked it through, particularly with the Treasurer, we established that, for reasons of policy consistency, the grants and the arrangements that we were going to put in place ought to be taxable. We accordingly increased the size of the package. That is that we did. The second point I want to make -  - There is not a tax windfall. The second point -  - There is no doubt about it, Mr Speaker - some mothers do 'ave 'em. The next point I want to make is this: we did this in full consultation with the dairy industry leadership. It actually is the model of cooperation: a partnership between government and a very strong industry leadership facing huge challenges in an industry which in many ways - this has to be said - itself sought deregulation because it saw an opportunity to expand on export markets. The bulk of Australia's milk is produced in the home state of the member for Corio - I do not know whether he knows that, but it is - and they drove deregulation.The third point that I want to make is a very important one as well. I think all Australians who are listening would like me, as a member of the government, to acknowledge that government does not have money of its own; it only has taxpayers' money. Of course the levy is not government's money; it is taxpayers' money - that is what it is, just like any other tax. In this instance, we have chosen to raise a tax to help with a very real challenge that was going to affect not just a lot of dairy farmers but a lot of the communities that they live in, and to deploy it in the best way possible in consultation with those industry leaders and with the affected community. Again I say that we on this side take this very seriously. We are not seeking, as Labor plainly are, to make cheap political points. If there was even an iota of sincerity in what they were doing, they would be approaching their state counterparts. That is what they would be doing. They would be going to the newly re-elected government in Queensland, they would be going to the Carr government, and they would be saying, `Get in behind the Commonwealth and help your regional communities.' But they are not doing it because there is nothing more than waffle on their side.The final point that I want to make - and again I say this - is that I am very concerned, and members of the government are very concerned, about what is happening in some of the worst affected communities. We will continue to work on the issues that you raise and the issues that we know are worrying people, in consultation with the industry.</DOC>

 - You get asked a question that might give us an opportunity to talk about good news, and all that happens over there is that they start to make a noise. But what I would like to inform the House about - and I am sure it is of interest to all members, because all members and their electorates benefit - is that the first quarterly -  - Do you think they will take it? - The first quarterly payments to local councils under the government's four-year $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery program will be made tomorrow. It kicks off a historic venture between the federal government and local councils where, for the first time, in something that has been incredibly widely welcomed by local councils, we are dealing directly. It is straight between the Commonwealth and local councils. We are making the grants directly to be spent on local priorities. In total, 127 councils tomorrow are going to receive over $15 million. A further 240 councils have now registered their details - the number grows daily - and we will be continuing to make payments on a weekly basis for the rest of the quarter so that every council that wishes to take up its first instalment can do so.There have been some councils - and we are being totally flexible on this - that have said they do not wish to access their grant yet. Some of them, for example, are being hampered by wet weather; others want to do more planning. We have said to them, `Understand, you are not going to lose your grant; it is guaranteed by legislation over the life of the program.' The government, in short, has got this excellent program, this very popular program, up and running very quickly. It was announced just last November - in fact, late November. We passed the legislation in December. The first payments are going to be made tomorrow. So road improvements can start rolling in the shire of the Whittlesea Shire Council in Victoria, in the member for McEwen's electorate, with an initial payment of $152,000, and in the member for Cowper's electorate, at Kempsey, of $180,000. The member for Hunter - we have not forgotten you -  - If that is an invitation, yes. And he will be pleased to note that the Singleton Shire Council in his electorate -  -  - was one of the very first to apply.  - One of your electorates was one of the very first to apply. - There you go. The benefits associated with the Roads to Recovery program are plainly enormous. It improves access to health and to education, and gives a boost to industry and local employment. Given these benefits, I have to say it is just impossible to fathom that the Leader of the Opposition would want to roll back the federal government's $1.2 billion local roads program. He wants to roll it back. As he told the general assembly of local government last December, `I will not say that we will not change this package.' That is what he said.The fact is that this is a package that has been very widely welcomed right across Australia. Tomorrow the money starts rolling out. If the Leader of the Opposition and his boondoggle gang had got off their bus on the Pacific Highway - which of course they did not want to build; there is a member over there who does not want -  -  - I really just wanted to make a couple of final points about the trip up the Pacific Highway, which of course we got under way. It is actually the biggest infrastructure project since the Snowy Mountains Scheme that governments have been involved in funding - $3.5 billion, opposed every inch of the way, when people like the member for Cowper were pushing it in opposition, by the then government. Of course, had that boondoggle bus left the Pacific Highway, I am sure that the realisation would have dawned that local roads are in urgent need of attention. Just as one final point: I think, if my maths are correct, had we been channelling, in the old-fashioned way, all of this through the old ALTD Act the charge rate at the moment per litre would have been not 4.95c a litre but about 7.93c. Just a note on the way through.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member's question, I have no knowledge of the specific instance to which he has referred. I am certainly well aware of the fact that the honourable member for Paterson is amongst a large number of members, particularly on this side of the House, who have sought assistance to obtain information in relation to the payments to individual dairy farmers. On a number of occasions my office has received requests for assistance from more than one person about the same case and we have endeavoured to be helpful where we can. In assessing these issues, the DAA has to strike a balance between its endeavours to be helpful to members of parliament and others making inquiries and its obligations to protect the privacy of individual dairy farmers.  -  - The DAA are very conscious of their obligations under the legislation in relation to these matters and seek to act responsibly in each instance. I will make some further inquiries about the case referred to by the honourable member. He may have to give me some more details or the name of the individual because, as I said, he has contacted my office on more than one occasion about dairy adjustment matters. I am happy to do that.Whilst I am on my feet, Mr Speaker, may I inform the House that 98 per cent of dairy farmers have now been informed of their entitlements under the Dairy Structural Adjustment Program and over three-quarters have received their payment. Those who have not received their notification - the other two per cent - are generally people who, for one reason or another, either have not completed their application or their affairs are the subject of court action of one kind or another and they are awaiting a final determination for that reason.The task of the Dairy Adjustment Authority is now almost complete. The balance of its work will involve the payments to be made over the next eight years. I notice that the opposition were talking about increasing the staffing numbers in the DAA. The reality is that that was done a year ago. What we are doing now is winding down the DAA because its task is complete. They are proposing just to build up a bureaucracy for no seeming purpose.The DAA has had a difficult task to complete in a very short period. It took considerable effort to put in place the necessary structures. That has been done. The overwhelming majority of farmers have now received their notice of entitlement. The difference between the 98 per cent and the 75 or 78 per cent is basically the 28-day period that has to expire between those two dates for objections where people can draw attention to any inaccuracies they regard in those payments. The procedures are now well and truly in place. I will look at the particular case referred to by the honourable member and, if there is any further information I need to give to the House, I will do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Members of the House will be aware that, as a result of the Howard government's initiatives to establish national literacy standards and assess every child, we are now seeing the first improvements in literacy for over quarter of a century. This government decided that we could not sit back, as the previous government did, and do nothing to make sure that every young Australian had the opportunities that literacy brings. Of course, when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for education - probably the worst minister for education in this country's history - some 30 per cent of young people could not read and write adequately. He could not think of anything to do in the portfolio to change the situation. This government has taken a large number of practical steps to improve and enhance literacy standards. This morning I announced a very significant new literacy initiative called the Books in Homes in Australia project. This is a pilot program under which the Commonwealth will provide books to some 10,000 young people in remote and educationally disadvantaged communities during the course of this year. The Books in Homes in Australia pilot is about encouraging schoolchildren to read by enabling them to choose books themselves and to own those books. Many of these young people have probably never before had the opportunity to own a book in their own home and to keep that book, read it and enjoy it again and again. The pilot project is a partnership between state governments, the Commonwealth and Scholastic Australia, a publisher of children's books. It is a great example of practical reconciliation as well as the operation of the social coalition in remote communities.  The Books in Homes in Australia pilot is based on a successful Books in Homes program founded in New Zealand by Alan Duff, the Maori author who wrote the widely acclaimed book Once were Warriors that was the basis of that quite remarkable film. Alan Duff has been deeply committed to spreading literacy amongst young Maori children in New Zealand. We had a close look at his scheme and decided that such a scheme had a real prospect of success in Australia as well. Alan Duff will be a consultant to this pilot project. Probably most, if not all, of us in this place have had the opportunity to get a great deal of pleasure out of reading for fun and learning in the process. I hope that this pilot will ensure that far more young Australians have this opportunity.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I just make the point that I have made my position clear in this matter, as I said last time, but I also acknowledge that, in my party, candidates, members and senators have considerable right at a democratic level - that is, the communities they come from, and their party organisation on the ground - to work these issues through. Nothing in that sense has changed. The only other point that I want to make to you is that it is, of course, very illustrative that the question was not asked by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, until very recently, wandered around this country thumping his chest, claiming some sort of moral high ground and indicating that anybody else who did not adopt his particular position was somehow a moral pygmy. Of course, he cannot do that any more. Although they claim some sort of incredible capacity at the top to control their party all the way down, they do in a sense operate a politburo, which my party does not. What did they choose to do in Queensland?  -   - Mr Speaker, if necessary, I will take a point of order. Apparently it is necessary for me to answer my own question. The fact is that in Queensland they did not preference One Nation last. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee who represents Sunraysia, which is responsible for about a quarter of the nation's grape harvest, for his question and acknowledge the representations that he has made on behalf of this industry over quite some period of time. I can confirm that Californian table grapes will not be allowed entry into Australia. The government has accepted the advice of the director of quarantine that further scientific research is needed to address possible risks before any trade in grapes could be permitted. Over recent times, honourable members will be aware of a significant outbreak of Pierce's disease and its vector, the glassy winged sharp shooter, in California. This outbreak has triggered expenditure in the United States of the order of $US40 million in an endeavour to curtail and confront the issue. Australia sent a team of scientists from the CSIRO - an entomologist and a plant pathologist - to California to look at the measures that have been undertaken and to obtain additional scientific information about this pest and disease. On the basis of their report, the director of quarantine has come to the conclusion that the higher risk profile alters our approach and the risk management measures necessary to deal with issues arising from grape imports from California. - To complete the answer: the director of animal and plant quarantine considers that, in light of the changed risk profile and uncertainties about the risk management techniques, there needs to be additional scientific work done before any further consideration can be given to the importation of Californian table grapes. The US authorities have been advised of this decision and, whilst naturally they are not satisfied with it, they have accepted that this is a serious issue for Australia and one that we have a right to have resolved. Australia will never compromise our clean, green image. We will adopt the strict standards necessary to protect our industries from risks of exotic disease or pests associated with imports, and these decisions will always be based on sound scientific assessment of the risks involved.</DOC>

 - I remember saying something substantially to the effect of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put to me but, as always, I will check the fine print. The decision announced today by me on behalf of the government will be warmly welcomed in the Australian community. This decision will not only reduce the price of petrol for Australian motorists but also impose a very important financial discipline on governments. I think the Australian public has long resented the indexation of taxes, first introduced by the Hawke Labor government in 1983. This is the first government that has been willing to abolish the automatic half-yearly indexation of excise. I think that will be very warmly welcomed. As I said earlier today, this decision has both a discretionary component, which is the reduction of 1½c a litre, and a structural component, which is the abolition of six-monthly indexation of excise. I believe it is widely welcomed in the Australian community, and I think increasingly the Australian public will see us as having taken a decision which will not only provide a reduction in the price of fuel -  - Not only will the discretionary reduction be welcomed but I think the Australian public will warmly applaud the government's decision to remove the automatic indexation of petrol excise. I think that will be very warmly applauded. I look forward to receiving the support of the opposition in legislating to remove the Hawke government's excise tax imposed in 1983.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes, I am aware of those claims, because I listened to the AM program yesterday and I heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition talking. One minute we were not spending enough and the next minute we were spending too much. Like his leader, he tries to walk both sides of the street. The claim that there is a huge windfall from the operation of the GST on higher petrol prices caused by higher world crude prices is wrong. What those people who assert that, like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, completely ignore is the substitution effect.  - `Oh,' he says, `the substitution effect.' The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should understand that, if a family is spending $15 to $20 more a week on filling up their car with petrol, it stands to reason that they have $15 to $20 less a week to spend on something else, and if those items attract GST then there is in fact no increase in the GST collection. The advice that we currently have on the basis of the two quarters to date in relation to this year's budget is to the effect that there has been no significant increase in the GST collections over what was predicted at the time of the budget. So the claim being made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that in some way there is a huge revenue bonanza as a result of this, is completely wrong. Moreover, I would point out that in the midyear economic and fiscal outlook higher petrol prices have in fact resulted in a reduced demand for diesel and petrol and therefore lower, not higher, excise collections. In fact, excise collection on petroleum products and crude oils is expected to fall by around $75 million in 2000 and 2001. So this claim that the GST has resulted in an enormous windfall for the government is completely without foundation.The member for Gilmore asked me whether there was an alternative policy. I searched around and found a quote from the Leader of the Opposition - this really is a beauty. On 15 February 2001, the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed by Leon Delaney, Radio 97, Tweed Heads, who said:So in terms of the possibility of abolishing the indexation of excise?To which the Leader of the Opposition replied:We don't oppose the indexation of excise per se, but we do think that governments have a right to consider these issues flexibly.In other words, we are in favour of it but we are also against it. It is like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: we are spending too much money giving excise relief, but on the other hand, we are not spending enough. In other words, if you belong to the Labor Party - the Australian lazy party - it is easier to walk both sides of the street instead of coming clean about what you are going to do.</DOC>

 - As the Prime Minister has already said, the principal reason for high petrol prices is world oil prices. Notwithstanding what the government has done today, it will take a lowering of world oil prices to ensure that there are still significant reductions passed on at the petrol pump. Today, the government has made a contribution in relation to the plight of Australian motorists who have been suffering under high petrol prices. We are quite pleased to admit that it took the coalition to act in this area. You never got any action in this area from the Australian Labor Party. It was the Australian Labor Party which introduced indexation in 1983 and for 13 years never touched it. When the Labor Party came to office, the petrol excise was 6c; when it left office it was 34c. The increase in petrol excise under the Labor Party every year for 13 years was 35 per cent per annum - every single year. This government has never increased petrol excise as a budgetary measure.  - The government continued the indexation, which it has now announced will be abolished. After taking into account the reduction which has been announced today, over the course of five years under this government the increase has been 2.3 per cent per annum; under Labor, for 13 years, it was 35 per cent per annum. - No wonder the Labor Party feel they have to interject on this issue. No amount of interjection will drown out this fact. Under this government, over five years, there has been an increase of 2.3 per cent per annum; under Labor, over 13 years, the increase was 35 per cent per annum. There is no doubt who has the better credentials in relation to petrol.</DOC>

 - The government has announced a 1.5c per litre cut in petrol excise which will take effect from midnight tonight. This tax cut is being introduced to assist Australian motorists who have suffered from high petrol prices in recent months principally as a result of high world oil prices. The government's fuel tax reduction will help to ease the financial burden on motorists while maintaining the government's responsible budget position. I want to make this clear. The cut in excise is for the benefit of motorists and not for the benefit of oil companies. The government expects the benefit of this reduction to flow through to motorists and not to be captured by the oil companies or indeed by retailers. To ensure that that is the case, the government will be prescribing this excise reduction under the price exploitation provisions of the Trade Practices Act. The price exploitation provisions of the Trade Practices Act give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission power to monitor prices, to demand information from businesses in relation to price setting and to name businesses that have engaged in price exploitation. The provisions, contained in part 5B of the Trade Practices Act, provide for fines of up to $10 million for companies which breach those provisions and up to $500,000 for individuals who breach those provisions.Let me make it clear: there is a moral and legal requirement for oil companies to pass on the full reduction in excise. The government has instructed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to step up its price monitoring operations to ensure that it can monitor the effects of these changes. The government also says to consumers that, in addition, they should conduct their own surveillance in relation to these matters. The government will not be tolerating any attempt by an oil company to take back that reduction in petrol excise by way of profit. This is a reduction for the benefit of the motorist, not for the oil companies.</DOC>

Secondly, in relation to the out years, I will be very happy to get those details and supply them before the end of question time.

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. Of course, the benefits in rural, regional and remote areas of the country of today's announcement are significant because of the necessity of fuel for so many people, not just for the pursuit of their businesses but also in their personal lives. For very many people in rural, regional and remote areas there is no such thing as the option of a taxi, a bus or a suburban train. If you want to access education or health services or simply have a social life you are dependent upon your motor vehicle. Of course, in that regard the cost of fuel is a very sensitive issue. Country people in our export industries are very well aware of the realities of world markets. They do recognise, I find as I move around, the realities of global markets in relation to oil and the impact that high crude prices have had on the cost of their fuel. But at the same time the reality is that -  - they welcome action taken by the government to share that heavy burden. I welcome the responsible way in which the government has gone about this. We will make certain that we will maintain strong economic management and a strong budget position, and that will help preserve the very foundations I talked about yesterday as leading to the improvement in terms of trade that we have looked for for so long for Australia's export industries. I think that people in country areas will certainly be looking very closely to see that moderation in fuel prices from the reduction in excise, and they will be seeking to ensure that it indeed flows. The abandonment of the automatic indexation of fuel excise, which was introduced 18 years ago by the Hawke Labor government, will place an additional discipline on government in regard to fuel excise in the future. It will deliver a small benefit as well, that might not have been picked up on, to users of off-road diesel. New businesses of course can claim back all of the excise on their fuel. At the moment, because the rebate rate is set on a six-month rolling average of the declared fuel excise rate, the rebate rate has traditionally lagged just a little behind the declared rate because of six-monthly CPI adjustments. The removal of the CPI adjustment will mean that this lag will be washed out of the system and, over the next six months, the rebate rate will come to be exactly the same as the declared excise rate.So this is a good decision, a responsible decision, that will continue the government's record of reducing fuel taxes and transport costs in regional Australia. Again I emphasise that this is in addition to the complete abolition of all fuel excise on rail. That is worth around $1 a tonne to wheat exporters in the north-west of New South Wales. It is well worth having. The very significant reduction in fuel taxes on the trucking industry is incredibly important to, say, cattle producers in western Queensland where transport can constitute about one-third of their operating costs. Then of course there is the $860 million package to relieve the differential between country and city prices that will be carefully monitored by the ACCC.  This is a record that stands in stark contrast to that of the ALP. Those who have sought to make cheap and opportunistic points out of all of this ought to be reminded that the only thing you can do when it comes to understanding the ALP is to look not at what they say but at what they do. When they were in government they presided over a 500 per cent increase in excise. Not only were they the indexation kings, but also they regularly introduced one-off discretionary increases in fuel excise. Of course, they never sought to compensate rural and regional people for the impact on their lives. In fact, they made the burden on the battlers worse because they penalised those who were running older cars on leaded fuel. The reality is that their plainly born-again conversion to concern over the cost of fuel is a joke and an obvious pretence. </DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that I had admitted that the surplus had been eroded. Can I say that I do not think it is an `erosion' of the surplus. I think that is the wrong expression to use in relation to additional defence spending and providing additional road funding. The Labor Party cannot have it both ways. They cannot demand, whenever the government has an expenditure program, that it should have been more. When I announced the innovation program, what did the Leader of the Opposition say? He said it should have been more; he did not say it should have been less. You are the last people in Australia who have any credibility to talk about getting rid of budget surpluses, because you are the people who ran up massive increases in government debt and left us with a government debt of between $80 billion and $90 billion. - There has been no alteration in relation to the figures that were produced at the time of the Midyear Economic and Financial Review that would in any way put the budget surplus at risk. As to questions relating to individual items such as spectrum, they are matters which are in a process of auction at the present time and I do not intend to make any comment. As far as Telstra is concerned, there has been no change to the position concerning Telstra, and that is that our first objective is to make sure that services in the bush are adequate, and only when proper arrangements have been made for the adequacy of those services will attention be turned to other matters concerning Telstra.  - I was asked for the figures for the out years. The impact of the announcement this morning on this year's budget is $140 million. As I indicated this morning, on next year's budget, it is $555 million; on the year 2002-03, $815 million; and on the year 2003-04, $1,160 million. I would point out for the information of honourable members that the projected cash surplus at the time of the midyear review in 2002-03 is $7.6 billion and in 2003-04 it is $12.9 billion. In other words, the decision that I announced this morning represents a very significant ongoing saving to the Australian taxpayer, because it has lifted off the shoulders of the Australian taxpayer the Hawke-Keating government's petrol indexation tax introduced in 1983.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I can inform the House that the Australian Bureau of Statistics today released the figures for the international trade in goods and services for January. In seasonally adjusted terms, the balance on goods and services trade for January was a deficit of just $37 million. In trend terms, the deficit again decreased in January to be $100 million. This is the smallest trade deficit, in trend terms, since May 1997.There was a slight dip in exports in today's figures, particularly in the rural sector, where wheat crops in particular had been affected because of exceptionally dry conditions in Western Australia and floods which had affected northern New South Wales and parts of Queensland. But exports are up 20.6 per cent over the year to January 2000.The Deputy Prime Minister yesterday referred to ABARE's forecast that farm commodity exports would increase 13.8 per cent this year and 7.6 per cent again next year. Net exports are now expected to make a contribution to growth - the first positive contribution to growth since the Asian economic crisis - of about one per cent. The very strong turnaround in our export position will contribute to a significant decline in the current account deficit in 2000-01.What we are seeing in the Australian economy is the development of a very competitive exports sector, not only helped along by the developments in relation to the exchange rate but also helped along by changes to taxation which have taken taxes off exports for the first time in Australian history. If it had not been for taking taxes off exports - which would not have occurred if it had not been for tax reform, opposed every step of the way by the `Australian Lazy Party' - rural Australia would never have been given the go that it has been given as a result of this to get its product out on the world markets on fair terms. We make no excuses for having helped rural Australia in the world export market by getting those taxes off their exports and by cutting the freight rates in relation to heavy transport. If it had not been for tax reform -  -  - In relation to transport, it was this government's reform of the taxation system which meant that we could cut the diesel tax on heavy transport by 24c a litre. If Labor had had its way, today you would be paying an additional tax of 24c a litre on diesel for everything going into or coming out of rural Australia. That is one of the definite benefits to rural and regional Australia. It has helped our exporters, and our exports are up, and these are benefits of taxation reform. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question. The short answer to your question is that we in the National Party are interested in quality telecommunications services to rural and regional Australia, in stark contrast to the ALP. Even at the most basic level of tightening the universal service obligation, we far outstrip your performance. In relation to the customer service guarantee, you did not even have one. We have put in place a whole series of requirements in terms of the timeliness of new connections, repairs and what have you, and very stiff fines when they are not met, which is helping to deliver the basic quality of services that people in rural and regional areas need with their telecommunications.Let me repeat that point: the ALP did not have a CSG - there were no obligations. No obligations were placed on Telstra or on any other telco to deliver decent service outcomes in rural and regional Australia. But there are today. When it came to assessing what the future needs might be, what did they do when we said that we would have an inquiry into establishing rural and regional service standards? They did what they so often do: they opposed us every inch of the way. And, when we announced who would head that inquiry, what did they do? In true ALP style, they tried to blacken the names of the people that we asked to head the inquiry. There is no genuine interest in this at all from the ALP. When the Besley inquiry handed down its findings, it clearly indicated that there were some matters that had to be addressed by the government, and we have given a commitment that we will address them. The ALP would not have given that commitment because they would not have had the inquiry in the first place. They are not interested. I do not believe that anyone listening to this on broadcast -  - No, there are a couple of other things that I want to point to as examples of their lack of commitment and of our commitment in contrast. Who was it that shut down the analog network? They shut it down. And who was it who helped find a replacement with Telstra? It was not the ALP.The other point I want to make is that we have now allocated about a billion dollars to upgrading and helping with rural telecommunications services - something the ALP would never have thought of doing. A $150 million tender to deliver untimed local calls was put out into the marketplace - a bit of competition - and what happened? We got an unbelievable result for the 40,000 people who live in 80 per cent of the land mass of this country, in remote areas. It was an unbelievable result. They have almost leapfrogged the pack to get right to the forefront of technology to deliver the full benefits of reduced costs and better standards of telecommunications. You name it - I reckon our record stands in stark contrast to yours. So the answer to your question in very simple terms is that we have delivered; you have not. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question, and I regret to inform the House that Australia is witnessing a sudden eruption of industrial disputation in three states. In Perth, the CFMEU is now threatening life bans on workers who refuse to join wild-cat industrial action. That is not my claim; that is the claim of the local AWU organisers. In Queensland, the CFMEU has just begun a seven-day strike at BHP collieries after rejecting a 19 per cent wage offer for workers who were already earning more than $80,000 a year. This is plainly a payback against BHP for trying to introduce workplace agreements in the west. It is one thing to be against BHP; it is another thing to damage Australia's international reputation and to jeopardise Australia's international trade. In Victoria the CFMEU seems to have more power than the state Labor government. It has just called a 24-hour strike against the Victorian government-sponsored long service leave scheme, breaking an earlier agreement with the Victorian government and others for no new claims until 2005. There is a clear message in this: the ALP wins elections on day one and on day two the strikes start. And that is bad news for Australian workers, because strikes cost jobs. - Labor governments cannot control union militancy because the unions control the Labor Party. Senators Lundy and Murphy were sent to this parliament as representatives of the CFMEU. They are the CFMEU's directors on the board of Labor Inc. In 1999 the CFMEU gave $628,000 to the Labor Party - that is the CFMEU's shareholding in Labor Inc.The Victorian strike is costing $17 million in lost production. The Queensland strike is costing $30 million in lost production. That $30 million loss will reverberate right around rural and regional Queensland, and the only people who do not seem at all concerned about this are the members opposite. You cannot shut them up on petrol, but when it comes to this action, which is threatening the jobs of ordinary workers, the Prince of Prolix is suddenly struck dumb. If the Leader of the Opposition is to be known as anything other than a ventriloquist's dummy for the ACTU, he will denounce these strikes.</DOC>

 - The proud record of the Howard government is one that has created nearly 800,000 jobs in the last five years. Of those, 371,000 are full-time positions. This is in stark contrast to what the last five years of the Labor government achieved, which was a paltry 27,000 jobs compared to 371,000 full-time positions under this government. In recent days we have seen some announcements from the opposition on policy - a policy-lazy government that has actually produced something. - What is it that the shadow minister has produced? In a comment to the Press Club on 27 February she outlined a new employment policy for the Labor Party. What is this new policy? Their entire policy direction is to add one new question -  - to the Australian Bureau of Statistics form on how you determine what the labour force is. It will not create a job. All it will do is create one more question. The most amazing thing is that the question that the shadow minister wants included is a question that has been part of the ABS statistics -  - for 22 years.  - For 22 years they have been asking the question -  - and I have brought the documents in here - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. No federal government has ever made a larger investment in public schooling in Australia than the Howard government. Some $9 billion will be invested in government schools by this government over the next four years. This year we are putting some $562 million more into government schools than the Labor Party did when it was in office. That is a 36 per cent increase over the life of this government. Let us make it very clear: we are not just spending tens of millions of dollars or hundreds of millions of dollars more on public education than Labor ever did, but billions of dollars more. We are spending billions of dollars more on public education than Labor ever did through legislated appropriations for the school sector.This commitment was further underlined by our decision to reinvest the Commonwealth share of the savings through the enrolment benchmark adjustment - the EBA - back into government schools. This will mean an additional $130 million for government schools in the next four years. A key feature of this decision will be that we will require the states to produce a plan showing how this money will be spent to develop opportunities for students to study in vital areas such as science, mathematics, technology and innovation. Furthermore, we will be requiring that these new programs and approaches be additional to those which are already funded. This has been essential from our point of view because some states were withdrawing money from government schools as the Commonwealth was putting more money in. No government was a worse offender in this regard than the Carr government in New South Wales. Its treasury has simply been taking money out as the Commonwealth puts money in. It has been relying excessively heavily on Commonwealth funding for the development of buildings and facilities in New South Wales, at great cost to the conditions under which pupils are studying.I was asked in the question whether I am aware of alternatives. I am aware of an alternative because the Leader of the Opposition has stated a policy of completely abolishing the EBA - not putting the savings back into government schools. He is simply going to abolish the EBA and thus open the door, once again, for the New South Wales Treasury to withdraw this money completely from the education system. Whereas our policy guarantees additional funding for students in government schools in New South Wales, there is no such guarantee attached to the policy of the Australian lazy party and the Leader of the Opposition. The beneficiaries of the Beazley policy will be the state treasuries and particularly the state treasury of the Carr government. The Beazley policy is not a policy for school students. It is a policy for his mates in the Labor Party in New South Wales. It is a windfall gain to them of $115 million over the next four years and, incidentally, it doubles the incentive for state treasuries to wink at this continuing exodus from public schools. All we can say is that this is a foolish policy, it is an unwise policy, it is an unthought-out policy, and we have to conclude that the serial non-performer on the other side of the table has struck again. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question and recognise the keen interest he shows in South Pacific affairs. The Australian government welcomes the decision today of the Fiji Court of Appeal upholding what is known as the `Gates judgment' of 15 November and confirming that the 1997 constitution of Fiji remains the supreme law of Fiji. The House may be interested to know that the court also noted that parliament was prorogued on 27 May 2000 for six months - that it was not dissolved - and that, under the 1997 constitution, the office of the president became vacant with the resignation of Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and that it took effect on 15 December. Under the constitution, the vice-president may perform the functions of the president for three months, that is, until 15 March this year - in two weeks time - unless a president is appointed sooner. The court also noted that the interim government failed to establish that it is the legal government of Fiji. This ruling of the Court of Appeal offers Fiji a very real chance to get out of the political crisis that has shrouded that country since 19 May last year. We very much hope that Fijians will use this opportunity to act decisively to uphold the rule of law. The people of Fiji now need to work together peacefully and with a strong will to restore the democratic and constitutional rule which has been denied to Fijian citizens for the last 10 months. The Australian government was encouraged by the Fiji interim government's statement to the Court of Appeal last week that it would accept the decision of the court and use its best endeavours to promote a return to constitutional legality. We now look forward to a positive response from the interim government to the ruling of the court. If that response is as we hope, the Australian government is willing to review the measures it has taken against Fiji and to provide all the assistance Australia can reasonably offer to help Fiji quickly back on the path to democracy. I know I speak for all members of the House - and perhaps it is noteworthy for the Fijians that all members of the Australian House of Representatives would agree with this view - that we would be the first to welcome Fiji when it once again takes its place as an honoured and respected member of the international community.</DOC>

 - What a transparent little set-up this is. The Prime Minister has plainly outlined the government's position, but he has also acknowledged the conditionality. There is no conflict at all between those two positions. We have done the right thing - something you would never have done. We went out there and deliberately set out to establish whether or not service provision levels were appropriate in rural and regional and particularly remote Australia. We established, care of the independent report - and you in your usual way sought to denigrate the characters of some, I have to say, very fine Australians who showed you up with the integrity of their report - that it was the best way to do it of the lot. You said that they were no good, that they were compromised, that they were this, that and the other -   - Mr Acting Speaker, I apologise. Of course, the quality and the integrity of the report gave the lie to the Leader of the Opposition's character assassination. We have entirely appropriately chosen to impose some conditionality upon our position. I think that is entirely appropriate. I see no problem with it. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for the question. The government's changes to the BAS reporting statement, announced last week, have been exceptionally well received by the business community. I will just take the opportunity to read a few quotes. The National Farmers Federation said:Rural Australia has been given a huge boost.The certified practising accountants said:A significant reduction in the compliance costs for small business.The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:The compliance burden of moving to the new tax system will be dramatically reduced.The accounting firm Hayes Knights said:Without question, the simplified BAS is definitely good news for small business.What is the Labor Party policy on this? There seems to be a bit of doubt about the Labor Party policy. On 6 February 2001, the Leader of the Opposition issued a media release stating:A Beazley Labor government will roll back the BAS red tape nightmare by only requiring small business to fully calculate the GST liability once a year.Again on 11 February, on the Business Sunday program, the Leader of the Opposition said:The first phase of our roll-back will mean that people will only do the BAS once a year. Three days ago - 26 February - on the local radio station 2NM, the shadow minister for small business described annual reporting as `the nightmare at the end of the year'. On the basis of the shadow minister's comments, can we now assume that annual reporting has been deleted from the Labor Party policy? If it has, could someone tell the Leader of the Opposition? In the meantime, what we have is confusion - the same confusion, heartbreak and distress that roll-back will cause small business. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I understand that it was announced yesterday that Arthur Andersen has been appointed as the receiver and manager of the Bradmill Undare Group, with the intention of selling the group's businesses either as a whole or separately. I am not aware of whether or not people contacted my office yesterday. As you can imagine, we get hundreds of calls a day and I am not given a note of each and every call that comes in immediately it arrives. But I will make some inquiries about that and find out if there has been any inappropriate delay in returning the call. We have no desire to be in any way discourteous to a union representative which is concerned about the welfare of its members. The textiles, clothing and footwear industry has been under a lot of pressure in this country for many years. I do not imagine that the honourable member is suggesting that we have only had difficulties in that sector since this government came to office because, if that were the implication, then she is displaying a considerable ignorance of the background of the industry. We have made a significant contribution towards assisting firms in this sector to meet the challenge of increased global competition through the $750 million TCF Post-2000 Assistance Package and the decision to pause tariff reductions at year 2000 levels and hold them at that level until 2005. Bradmill, like other TCF businesses, would have benefited from the range of assistance measures that successive governments, including my own, have put in place. I will investigate the matter raised in relation to contact with my office and I will also find out what has occurred in relation to assistance. If there is anything that the government can do to help the situation, we will. You mentioned another firm. I remind you that the assistance there helped the workers. It did not help the company; it helped the workers. I remain surprised that the Australian Labor Party, through its most senior figure in this country, namely, the Premier of New South Wales, still refuses to match the employee entitlement contributions of this government. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for the question. Before answering it, I inform the House that February was the first month in 28 months to be free of any unauthorised boat arrivals. In relation to the question asked by the honourable member, members may be aware that today my department is hosting a seminar where a number of new research papers are being presented. I am pleased that a number of members have made time to participate and to hear some of the presentations that are being made. I welcome also the participation of a member of the opposition frontbench in the discussions taking place there.The research is particularly interesting because it has found that a properly structured immigration program can produce very significant and beneficial outcomes for the Australian community as a whole. I am sure honourable members will remember that, in the early 1990s, findings from research into the economics of migration were that immigration was largely neutral in its impact. One of the reasons is that the migration program, particularly in the last year of the former government, was heavily biased in favour of family reunion where skills are not always relevant factors for determining entry. However, today, under the policies that are maintained by this government and which have restored integrity to the migration program, we can show that immigration now has an unequivocally positive impact, and that is as a result of the changes in its composition. Those changes in composition have, I think, been crucial in maintaining public confidence in the immigration program. A report by Econtech, for example, shows that, due to changes in the migration program between 1995-96 and 2000-01, living standards have been progressively raised. For example, it shows that annual consumption per head, it is conservatively estimated, will be boosted by $257 per capita by the year 2007-08. Work force productivity will be about 0.08 per cent higher by that same year in comparison with what it would have been under the former policies. This is because of the switch to the skilled stream and the increased overall skill level of those who come within that stream. The labour force participation rate will also be about 0.62 per cent higher than it was under former policies. This gain is due to the shift in the age structure of arrivals towards the prime working age group. The research also shows that there has been little impact in terms of employment. In fact, it shows that the program has been beneficial. It is important to understand the reason for that. It is because the increased focus on skilled migration has helped to correct ongoing problems of job mismatch where there is an excess of demand for skilled labour and an excess of supply of unskilled labour. Other research also clearly indicates that impact, particularly through the use of the new points test. For example, it shows that independent, skilled migrants have an unemployment rate of only about seven per cent some six months after arrival. That truly is a remarkable outcome and it represents a very significant reduction from the 24 per cent unemployment experienced by migrants entering under the same category under policies conducted six years ago.The budgetary impact which the honourable member asked for can be seen in Chris Richardson's report - updating the existing model - on the impact of migration on the Commonwealth budget. It takes into account the introduction of the GST as well as putting into that model an accrual accounting adjustment. His report highlights the significant positive impact that skilled migration has on the Commonwealth budget. Without the skilled stream, immigration would have a negative impact on Commonwealth finances. The skills stream of the migration program in the year 2000-01 is estimated to contribute some $1.4 billion to the budget over five years. I am sure honourable members would be pleased to see the outcome of the remodelling of the immigration program to put an important emphasis on keeping the program balanced in terms of skill as against other categories which have adverse economic outcomes.</DOC>

 - What I have always said about unemployment is that this government came to office when I believe it was 8.7 per cent and that under this government it has fallen to 6.7 per cent. Under this government, nearly 800,000 people who did not have work under the Labor Party have been put back into jobs. I have also said that it is important that we continue to run a strong economy and that if you continued to grow the economy at four per cent you would continue to eat into the unemployment rate at about half a per cent per annum, which is what has happened over the last four years as the economy has grown by four per cent. That is the point I made: if you continued to grow the economy at four per cent, the unemployment rate would continue to reduce. So how do you grow an economy at a strong growth rate? You keep the budget in balance, something Labor could never do. The last five budgets of the Australian Labor Party cumulated a deficit of $80 billion. The only trick that the then finance minister had in the bag, when he was running a $10 billion deficit, was to go around, as he did during that 1996 election, and claim that the budget was in surplus. He went around during the 1996 election and said that the budget was in surplus when it was $10 billion in deficit. The second thing you have to do is to keep interest rates low, which this government has also put in place with a new agreement. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition apparently interjects in relation to interest rates. - The home mortgage interest rate today is at 7½ per cent. The lowest it was under Labor, when they went out of office, was 10½ per cent - $3,000 a year more. The third thing you have to do is to lock in low inflation, which this government is doing. The contribution to growth from the new taxation system has been that it has cut company tax, capital gains tax and income tax, abolished wholesale sales tax and will abolish stamp duties and financial institutions duty on 1 July. Those are the things that create a growing economy, those are the things that create real jobs and it is the coalition that stands for job creation. </DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Page. I certainly can confirm that foot-and-mouth disease is perhaps the most feared disease of animals around the world. Whilst it is present in countries around the globe, particularly in Asia, parts of South America and Africa and, at times, in Europe, and alerts and precautions are constantly in place, the outbreak in the United Kingdom has certainly attracted international attention and causes particular concerns because of the large number of movements of people and cargo between the UK and the rest of the world.Since I reported to the House on this issue last week, the situation in the UK has continued to deteriorate. Several more farms have been identified with the disease, and now it is clear that it has spread to Wales and Scotland. There has also been a case confirmed in Northern Ireland and, as a result of cattle moving from a property in Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland, some cattle have been destroyed in Ireland. There have been further reports about outbreaks in other countries in Europe. So far those are not confirmed, but obviously the government is monitoring the situation in relation to those reports as well. The United Kingdom has closed all abattoirs for a further two weeks and the movement of all animals around the United Kingdom, except for poultry and horses, has been banned. In addition to the measures that have been taken overseas, Australia has upgraded its own security, particularly at the airports, so that we can take every possible precaution to ensure that this disease does not come to Australia. In particular, all passengers who have been to the United Kingdom in the last three months will be directed to the red channel at the customs border point. In particular, those people who have been near farms or in agricultural areas where the disease has been in outbreak will be subject to detailed scrutiny.I accept the fact that this will cause some inconvenience to passengers. Reports suggest that there are delays at the airports, particularly at the early morning time slots, when a lot of flights are arriving from European ports. I apologise for that inconvenience, but this is so important that we cannot accept any degree of compromise. It is absolutely essential that the level of scrutiny be detailed. In particular, evidence of straw, dirt or anything that is likely to carry the disease into Australia will result in disinfestation and processes being taken to ensure that any suspect goods are seized. All products that could potentially carry foot-and-mouth disease have been banned entry, and questions will be asked particularly about dairy products and the like.We estimate that these measures will mean that about one million extra people will be put through the red channel at airports in one year. Obviously, that will require significant resources. The government has increased the number of people available for border patrol activities at the airports - almost double, in fact, in the last five years. We are so far managing these matters by rostering extra shifts, but I welcome the Prime Minister's assurance that additional resources will be provided if required. I should also point out to the House that these measures are not likely to be short term. It is inevitably going to go on for many months. We will certainly be continuing this high level of surveillance until the UK is free of the disease, and the international authorities once again certify the UK to be free of foot-and-mouth disease. That will be many months and could, indeed, extend to a period of years. We need to have a major national effort to protect ourselves from this horrific disease. We feel for UK farmers and the UK economy, but the reality is that that makes us all the more determined to ensure that our quarantine measures are able to address any challenge and that Australia remains free of this disease, as we have been for the last 130 years. </DOC>

 - The government has, of course, seen today's building approval figures which, incidentally, show that approvals, which have been down in the previous quarters in trend terms, appear to have turned. It is always important that, when looking at building approvals and building construction generally, you take into account one-off and transitional factors. Forward indicators in the housing sector, such as building approvals and finance approvals, suggest that the sector is stabilising and returning to growth during 2001. - Yes, there were one-off factors because, prior to July of last year, I believe that construction had reached its highest percentage in GDP terms on record. Of course, the reason for that was a pull forward as a result of taxation changes, which is what the government said. If you had a pull forward - that is, these figures were greater in March and June - then, consequently, you will have a downturn in September and December, which is what the government predicted and what has actually occurred. Once we get over the transitional factors, we believe that housing construction will start to strengthen, as has been shown by the approval figures which were released today. It will continue to strengthen particularly in a climate of low interest rates. Anybody who is worried about the house building industry or housing construction will support low interest rates. Apart from the previous year, interest rates under this government are now at a 30-year low - interest rates which were never achieved under the Australian Labor Party, which had interest rates at 17½ per cent in the late 1980s. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects. I say, where there is no understanding there is no conscience. He understands so little about economic policy that he has no conscience about being part of 17½ per cent interest rates. Imagine what that was doing to the young families of Australia as they watched their interest rates go to 17½ per cent. Anybody who wants to get up here and talk about building construction will commit themselves to a low interest rate environment. I say that to the shadow minister opposite, because I have never heard her champion the policies that would give low interest rates in this country. As I recall, she was out complaining not so recently that the government was not spending enough money on this or enough money on that. The people who want to have low interest rates in this country will be supporting, not opposing, good economic policy and will be giving their support to those things that will keep the Australian economy growing strongly on low interest rates, which is a policy of the coalition government.</DOC>

 - Retail trade figures for January were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics today, showing that retail trade increased 0.9 per cent for the month of January and 7.2 per cent through the year to January. This comes after a 0.9 per cent increase in December and, overall, the combined increase in the two months points to considerable momentum in retail trade over the Christmas-New year period. Interestingly enough, there appears to have been some adjustment again, with recreational goods retailing recording the largest increase, largely reversing falls back in October, November and December, and department stores recording decreases unwinding the increases recorded in previous months. Overall, the retail trade figures for January indicate a strengthening in retail trade in December and January, something that the government welcomes. Again, in relation to retail trade we saw massive transitional factors occurring back in July last year. There was a massive bring forward during the month of June as people sought to make purchases prior to the introduction of the GST, and a put back after the introduction of GST for the month of July, but a gradual unwinding over the course of the year. A point I made in relation to the building construction industry, that the figures in the national accounts over the last two quarters will have large one-off and transitional factors. It is a question of looking through those, as we will be able to do, I believe, in future quarters to get some better picture, absent those one-off and transitional factors, in relation to where the economy is going. Households have benefited from large income tax cuts from 1 July of this year. We have had a recent interest rate cut and pensions have been increased as part of the compensation flowing from the new taxation system. All of that will be beneficial for consumption in future months. I have already remarked on the fact that the housing sector, which had a significant bring forward in the March and June quarters and declines in September's and December's, should be supported by rising housing affordability. Another thing that perhaps we have not dwelt on enough in this House is the government's First Home Owners Scheme. The government introduced from 1 July 2000 a first home owners scheme of up to $7,000 for young Australians who had not owned a home before - in fact, any Australians who had not owned a home before. I want to make it clear, because I have seen some of the states passing this off as their own scheme, that the First Home Owners Scheme is funded out of GST revenues by an agreement and implemented by the Commonwealth government. If it were not for the Commonwealth government, the First Home Owners Scheme would not have come about. It was never put in place by Labor governments nor was it put in place by state governments. It was a first home owners scheme which came about as a result of the new taxation system, and it has been warmly welcomed, particularly by young Australians. The Labor Party flips and flops on these issues, I have noticed. Last night we saw the Leader of the Opposition claiming that the government's tax changes had been a dampener on the economy.  - And one of their leading intellectuals intervenes in support of that proposition from the front bench now. During 2000, the Labor Party opposed the government's tax package because they said it was too generous and unaffordable. The whole Labor Party attack during 2000 was that it was a fiscal stimulus which was going to lead to overheating. For example, Mr Beazley in a press release entitled `Who do you think you are kidding' of 3 February 2000 had this to say:The economy is now in its ninth year of expansion. Most economists recognise...growth...has been unbalanced, driven by debt-fuelled consumption, not investment or net exports.So you will presumably be pleased at the moment that consumption is coming off and exports are booming -  - Exports are up 21 per cent over the course of the year which, in anybody's language, even the member for Hotham's, is booming exports. If 21 per cent is not booming exports, I would like to see what they are. Yes, booming is the fact, and no amount of interjection takes away from a 21 per cent increase in exports over the year. Then the Leader of the Opposition had this to say: ...the net fiscal stimulus in this tax package of more than $6 billion in the first year alone, and around $20 billion over three years, runs the risk of fuelling consumption and overheating the economy.All through the year 2000, the government was being attacked for fuelling consumption and overheating the economy. The Labor Party was against the government's income tax cuts because they said they were too large. That was the attack that the Labor Party had on them. Now of course the Labor Party wants to run the completely contrary argument and say that the new tax system was not stimulatory enough. The new tax system put more money back in the pockets of Australians. With the largest income tax cuts in Australian history, we can now see why that was a good policy. We can see why the Labor Party was wrong to oppose it and we can see the complete opportunism of the Leader of the Opposition who opposes everything the government does but on completely contrary and opposite grounds simultaneously.</DOC>

 - The government last week cut taxes in relation to petrol excise  -  - Last week the government cut taxes by cutting the petrol excise by 1.5c a litre, and I think it is a decision that the Australian public have welcomed. In addition to that, the government did something which the Labor Party could never have done and that was it announced the end of automatic indexation in relation to petrol - again, a decision that the public have welcomed. Both the Prime Minister and I have made the point that having cut taxes means that coming into this budget round, the government will have to take a tight rein on expenditure and will have to target measures accordingly. I am asked the question about the welfare statement. As I recall, the government has never put a sum, any sum at all, on the amount of the reforms in relation to welfare. The fact that the Labor Party asserts it has, of course, does not make it fact; that is one of the Labor Party's old tricks. As to what will be done in the budget, and I will be giving this answer a lot between now and the end of May, I can assure the House, the government will not speculate on the measures it will be announcing in the budget. You can wait until budget night when all will be revealed.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Makin. I know she has a very keen interest not only in child care but also in family values. I am delighted to inform the House that the child-care policies that the coalition government has introduced have meant that child care is far more affordable today and there is far higher usage than there ever has been. A leading Sydney paper we all know, the Sunday Telegraph, published an article yesterday headlined `100,000 more join child care'. This is good news for all families and of course particularly those children who can now get into funded Commonwealth programs. Why is that? It is because there has been a significant increase in child-care benefit. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. In the first four years of the coalition government, $4 billion was spent on child care, which was a 30 per cent increase on the previous four years when the ALP was in government. In the next four years we are planning to spend $5.6 billion. What we have done, of course, is to make child care easier to access by reducing the complexity of the system that was put into place by the Labor Party. The best thing is that we have seen that long day care is up 22 per cent. Now 367,000 children are in long day care. In family day care there has been an increase of 14 per cent, 95,000 children, and outside school hours there is an increase of 16 per cent, or 124,000. This means that not only is child care becoming more affordable but also there is greater utilisation, particularly for all those many private child care centres and family day care centres right throughout this country. Further good news is that at the next indexation point for child-care benefit we will be increasing it by 5.8 per cent, and that means that there will be a $7 increase to those receiving the maximum benefit, going from $122 to $129. You have to ask yourself: what is Labor's policy? We know they are policy lazy, that they do not have a policy on child care. The only policy they had was the lowest common denominator, which was scare tactics. The Leader of the Opposition claimed on 24 June in a doorstop interview that the GST would massively increase the cost of child care. He was wrong on that. The Leader of the Opposition claimed on 1 August last year that people are now paying more for child care. He was wrong on that as well. What we are seeing is a far greater utilisation and child care being more affordable. That is because this government is listening and acting. Not only are we building stronger communities but we are building stronger families through our sensible child-care policies.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is no. Perhaps I can take the Leader of the Opposition through the facts, as distinct from deliberately provocative and scaremongering rhetoric which can only be hurtful and damaging to vulnerable people in the community. I am certain that the expression `clawback' is being used in internal documents. That does not automatically make it a correct expression. I believe that in these circumstances the use of the word `clawback' is clumsy shorthand for something that cannot properly be described as an act of recovering money, which is the understanding that I think should be given to clawback in circumstances such as this. What has happened is that on 1 July last year a pension increase of four per cent was paid. It was made perfectly clear that that represented not only a two per cent real increase but also an advance on a future increase. In relation to the adjustment in March, all that has occurred is that there has been an avoidance of a double payment.  -  - The Leader of the Opposition and others may laugh at that, but the very document to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred contains the statement that the action has been taken to avoid double-dipping. That is the language that is used by the very document to which he has made reference. I will be circulating for the benefit of honourable members, and also for others in this building who are interested, a little chart that shows what has happened in relation to the basic pension rate. It shows that in June last year it was $372 and that as a result of the changes the government has introduced it will be $402. It also shows that, if you had just had the CPI plus the MTAWE increases and no tax reform measures, it would only have risen from $372 to $394.10. Interestingly enough, it shows that, if you had applied the policies of the former government, the Labor government, of CPI indexation only and no tax reform, you would have gone from $358.70 to a total of $379.39. In other words, there is a difference from $402 from the coalition to $379.39. Who is short-changing, who is mugging, the pensioners now?The reality is that we paid a four per cent increase on 1 July. Properly using the expression, it is not being clawed back. All that is occurring is that -  - as foreshadowed at the time -  - as foreshadowed at the time, the action being taken merely avoids a double payment. There has been no clawback, there has been no deduction and there has been no deceit. The only people who deserve to be criticised on this issue are the members of the Australian Labor Party who are deliberately scaring older people for their own political benefit.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. With a notice that was given in this parliament last Thursday, from midnight Thursday the government reduced petrol excise by 1.5c a litre. The government has also given notice that it will be introducing legislation to abolish the Labor Party's automatic indexation of petrol prices. That legislation will be passed prior to August when, if we were not to pass that legislation, the Labor Party's legislation for automatic indexation would take effect. I said in the House on Thursday and I say again: petrol excise was cut not for the benefit of oil companies but for the benefit of motorists, and the government expects that benefit to be passed on to motorists. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission did extensive monitoring from midnight on Thursday night and throughout the course of Friday and reported that petrol prices in metropolitan areas fell on average by 1.7c per litre between 1 March and 2 March. We welcome the fact that that cut was passed on to motorists and we make it entirely clear to retailers and oil companies that we expect it to be passed on permanently to consumers, who are supposed to benefit.On the weekend, the Prime Minister made the perfectly justifiable point that, if they so wished, the premiers of Australia are in a position to reduce the cost of petrol to motorists. On radio in Sydney today, Premier Carr made the extraordinary claim that this could not be done; that the premiers were no longer being paid revenue compensation. He claimed that it stopped in the middle of last year. I want to go through this in some detail. Prior to 1997, the states had business franchise fees taxing petrol. When the High Court struck those down, at the request of the states the Commonwealth levied 8.3c per litre on the petrol price, collected for and on behalf of the states and paid back to them. When we moved to the new taxation system, the Commonwealth and the states entered into an agreement by which the Commonwealth would pay to the states full revenue for all of the taxes to be abolished - financial institutions duties, bank accounts debits tax, stamp duties on mortgages and marketable securities - and as a term of that would pay to the states the equivalent of the revenue replacements, the equivalent of the business franchise fees, the equivalent of 8.3c per litre. That money has been paid to the states under that agreement from 1 July. The only state which takes that money and refunds it to motorists is the state of Queensland, and it does so only after Mr Beattie tried to abolish it and was caught by the Commonwealth government. Let me give the House the figures. The New South Wales government is paid $707 million in revenue replacements - the equivalent of 8.3c per litre. Out of that $707 million, it refunds $47 million to motorists; it pockets $660 million. It has the capacity to refund to the motorists of New South Wales 7.2c per litre. I go to Victoria. Many of us remember Premier Bracks when he was a Labor Party staffer up here, working for Mr O'Keefe, the member for Burke, I believe - probably in the days when the Labor Party increased the petrol excise by 5c a litre in the 1993 budget, I think, but I would have to go back and have a look at that. On Friday, Premier Bracks was saying to the Prime Minister, `You should be cutting excise. This is something that the federal government should have been doing for a long period of time.' Let me make this suggestion to Premier Bracks: if you are really interested in Victorian motorists, you have the capacity to reduce by 6.6c a litre the petrol excise in Victoria. Victoria is paid $507 million as the revenue replacement, the equivalent of 8.3c a litre, and Premier Bracks, who is so concerned about Victorian motorists, refunds $38 million out of $507 million. He has the capacity to pass on another $469 million or 6.6c a litre.So the Prime Minister was entirely correct on the weekend. The states are still paid the revenue replacements. They are paid the equivalent of 8.3c a litre. I notice that the Labor Party are now intervening in support of the Labor premiers keeping the petrol excise - aren't you? The truth of the matter is that the Labor Party do not care about the petrol excise; they will do anything to defend a fellow member of the Australian Labor Party. They are not interested in this, because the Premier of New South Wales has the capacity to return that money to the motorists of New South Wales and the Premier of Victoria has the capacity to return that to the motorists of Victoria. To those premiers who want to run around and grandstand on the issue, we say very clearly and very simply: put your money where your mouth is.</DOC>

 - I have not seen that particular document but I certainly do remember making that statement. I will check the context again but, from recollection, it was in relation to the claims that you had made and some reports that appeared in the papers about the issue raised in the previous question by the Leader of the Opposition. It is true that, through the operation of the automatic indexation of the rent allowance threshold, which has been going on since 1993 and was introduced by the former government, there are adjustments made from time to time to the rental allowance. That has always been the case and there is nothing new about that, and there will not be anything new about that in relation to March. Those adjustments have been a function of the system since it was introduced and, according to the advice that I have received, none of the policies that we have introduced in relation to the GST or associated matters have in any way affected the operation of the threshold. Obviously, if you index a threshold and your rent does not go up, you can be affected. That was the case under the Labor Party and it remains the case under this government. </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for McEwen for her keen interest in this matter. I can inform the House that the ACCC collected price data for unleaded petrol, diesel and LPG over the weekend. Prices were collected twice on Saturday and once on Sunday. The data from 2,500 sites in five capital cities indicates that prices have fallen by more than 1.5c per litre, the excise reduction, as competition and lower oil prices have also flowed through to the price of petrol. The ACCC, however, advise me that, on the monitoring information so far, the full benefits of the excise reduction have been passed through to consumers. For the information of the member for McEwen, price falls in some parts of rural and regional Australia will only start to come through this week as service stations receive the cheaper petrol into their tanks. Excise is applied at the refinery gate, so some country petrol stations with larger reserves may not be able to pass on the full benefit until they receive their new deliveries. The same principle applies whether the excise goes up or goes down. Therefore, the ACCC will be monitoring 1,500 sites in 150 towns across regional and rural Australia this week to ensure that the excise reduction is passed on to consumers in full.Compared to 1 March, as of 9 a.m. today petrol in Adelaide is 2.4c a litre cheaper; it is 89.3c. In Melbourne petrol is 3.3c a litre cheaper. The price is 87.8c, of which 6.6c a litre goes directly to Steve Bracks. In Sydney petrol is 3.9c a litre cheaper, but Sydney has the highest petrol prices in the country at 93.5c a litre. How ironic it is that Bob Carr gets the most tax - 7.2c per litre. In Brisbane there has been the biggest fall in petrol prices in the country. Brisbane petrol is 4.9c a litre cheaper at 82.9c a litre. As of last night in Perth petrol is 4c per litre cheaper at 90.7c. - You have got to love the member for Hotham - he is very handy at the most appropriate moments. I took the opportunity to have a look at the Customs Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001. This is the bill that the Leader of the Opposition was using as a fly swatter in the House - and members will remember this - talking about how the Labor Party were going to cut excise. The intriguing thing about that is that you have a look at that bill and you say to yourself, `What's missing?' I will tell you what is missing: what is missing is price monitoring; what is missing is the protection of the ACCC. -  - The Labor Party throw their hands up in the air and guffaw. We have in place consumer protection to ensure that the price benefits go straight through to consumers. The Labor Party are so policy lazy that, when they make a proposal, they do not bother with consumer protection; they worry about their mates in the oil companies getting the benefit. We will fine companies up to $10 million if they do not pass through to consumers the full benefit of the excise reduction. The policy-lazy Labor Party would never come up with that sort of consumer protection. </DOC>

 - I am always glad when the member for Grayndler shows an interest in the electorate of Richmond, because the only interest he does show there - particularly in those people who choose to live in mobile home parks - is to scare them, as his question has no validity whatsoever as he masquerades as a caravan park tenant. The simple point is that those people receiving pensions, particularly those people living in mobile home parks, will be substantially ahead under the new taxation system. As the Prime Minister mentioned and perhaps I can demonstrate, if the Labor Party had been in government, those on a single age pension would be receiving $379 and under the coalition - because we have not only increased them, but also tied them - they are receiving $402. This clearly demonstrates that blue is coalition and red is the Labor Party. There is no substance whatsoever to the member for Grayndler's question. He should spend less time in scaremongering older Australians, because, under the total GST compensation package, they are ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his interjection when he said, `Well, he keeps at it, and he's nearly right.'Opposition members - `Nearly there'! - `Nearly there'? Well, `nearly there', `nearly right'. The fact of the matter is that the point I have been making to the House in the last week is that the Labor Party in one breath say that they support the defence white paper but they have an additional offering of two free submarines, which they are not prepared to disclose how they are going to pay for. I have brought with me today the defence white paper, Defence 2000 - Our Future Defence Force. This is the best document for the defence of this country we have seen in decades in Australia. The member for Kooyong refers to naval expenditure and I refer all members to page 97 which spells out in detail the additional funding required to meet the objectives the government have set for additional naval expenditure and, obviously, naval equipment. In respect of the submarines, it is well known that we are spending more money on submarines to fix up the problems that we inherited from the previous government and, in particular, from the Leader of the Opposition when he was defence minister.It is about time that the Labor Party spelled out in some detail how they are going to pay for two additional submarines. The reason they have got to do that is that, unless they are prepared to tell us where the money is coming from, it is pretty obvious that what they intend to do is to shift the money around in the Defence portfolio - in other words, they will gut the white paper whilst at the same time having the gall to say to the Australian public that they support the document. The Leader of the Opposition has a bit of a record when it comes to financing and managing a project of this sort. In fact, back in 1986 the Financial Review reported:The Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, yesterday rejected recent claims that the cost of Australia's submarine project would exceed its $2.6 billion budget.In 1987, though, he did give us a glimpse of his real abilities as the defence minister. He said:The figures that will be presented to the Cabinet, the parameters of which I mentioned in the House yesterday, are a result of that process. It is not a process involving my sitting down and trying to work out the costs of a submarine.And then he said these immortal words:Quite clearly I am not capable or competent to do so.Amen to that, Mr Speaker. I could not think of anybody more incompetent or more incapable of spelling out the cost implications and the policy implications of Labor's two free submarines policy. Yet he is continuing to push the two free submarines. This is just one example of the narrowcasting that goes on when the microphones are turned off. In the Advertiser on 6 July last year the headline tells it all: `Beazley pledges a clean river and two new subs'. Furthermore - and he is convinced about it - `The case for building more was impeccable', to quote from the Adelaide Advertiser. Labor have a policy with a billion-dollar-plus hole in it. It is about time they exercised some responsibility and told us how they are going to pay for it; otherwise their claims about supporting what the government are doing are hollow. We think the defence white paper deserves support. It deserves substantial support - not the sort of playing at the edges we typically get from a lazy opposition who are not prepared to spell out their real policy position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I will say a couple of things about some of the things that the Commonwealth government are doing in his electorate in a moment. Our record on rural and regional health, I think, speaks loudly and clearly for itself. We are determined to do everything that we can to ensure a reasonable quality of service delivery right across Australia in terms of health and health outcomes. One clear piece of evidence is the $562 million health package More Doctors, Better Services. It will get more doctors, more allied health professionals and more specialists into country areas. There is an extensive shortage in all three areas. There has been the extension of the full Medicare rebate to GP services provided by OMPs, other medical practitioners. There has been a significant contribution to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, ACRRM as it is known, to strengthen its role in supporting and training rural GPs. There has been a $117 million commitment for nine new rural clinical schools and two new university departments of health. At least 25 per cent of medical students will receive a minimum of half of their training in rural and remote areas. This will dramatically change the way in which medical education is delivered in this country. It will create a truly rurally focused national network of professional medical and health training.  An example is the Whyalla Rural Clinical School, which I visited with the Minister for Health and Aged Care some 13 or 14 months ago. There was a real excitement in the air and a very positive attitude about what they are achieving. That will have a wide outreach into the Spencer Gulf region and the Eyre and the York peninsulas, including the centres of Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Coober Pedy, Port Lincoln and the surrounding district. We have established, too, the Rural Australia Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme, an idea that came up, as the minister for health will recall, amongst other places, at Mudgee in my electorate. The scheme provides up to $10,000 for country students to study medicine. The research shows that young people from country areas are nine times more likely to practise in rural, regional or remote areas than are people from metropolitan areas. It is very interesting to note that in broad terms - I think the minister for health would confirm this - to get the supply of country doctors and specialists needed, the medical schools in the country need to be averaging around 25 per cent in their intake of country kids. Do honourable members know what it got down to under the ALP? We are addressing a massive policy failure - not just a lack of provision of resources but also a failure of planning - by the previous government. In some medical schools I understand it got down to two or three per cent. We are aiming to get it back up to 25 per cent with these sorts of approaches. The Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme will provide $20,000 to 100 medical students annually, conditional upon a commitment on their part to work in a rural area for six years. More recently I have strongly supported the request from the AMA and the Rural Doctors Association for a proper look at the issue of the impact of the Trade Practices Act on the recruitment and retention of doctors in rural areas. There is a continual expression of concern here. We need to get it sorted out. Through pressure from the minister for health, from me and from others, the New South Wales government is finally starting to look like it might do something about the spiralling cost of medical indemnity insurance. In the town of Mudgee in my electorate the cost of obstetrics has got so high that the local GPs are simply talking about not delivering babies locally - sending people 150 kilometres away just to have babies - when at every other time the expectations of these Australians, entirely reasonably, would have been to have had their babies in Mudgee. This reflects the Labor Party's lack of commitment to health in rural and regional areas. The Victorian government, back in the days when Mr Kennett was Premier, overcame the problem quite readily by classifying visiting medical officers as employees of hospitals, meaning that the insurance costs were covered by the Victorian government, not by individual doctors. But what did we get in New South Wales? As usual, we got a refusal to grapple with this very serious problem. Those Labor Party attitudes were reflected last night by the Leader of the Opposition when he announced the ALP's priorities for health. Lots of platitudes were delivered last night by the Leader of the Opposition but, in reality, compared to what we have delivered, no commitments at all. We have the runs on the board.The question has to be asked: where were the federal ALP when we announced in last year's budget the $562 million package More Doctors, Better Services? What was the response? Silence. They were alone in that silence. The package was welcomed by, amongst others, the National Rural Health Alliance, the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine, the rural doctors, the Australian Democrats, the ICPA, the NFF, the AMA, the Council of the Ageing, and rural people right across Australia. But where were the ALP? Silent. </DOC>

 - These claims by the shadow minister have been investigated. We have seen these articles suggesting that Telstra has reduced its level of capital expenditure in the customer network, and they appear to be quite clearly wrong. Telstra has advised -  -  - Whatever it takes, regardless of how you spin it or how you put it out. The one thing that ought to be clearly stated is that there is absolutely no interest whatsoever beyond political opportunism involved in the service outcomes to rural and regional Australians from those opposite. Telstra has advised that, at the beginning of its financial year, it forecast expenditure on the customer access network of $1.4 billion and has since advised that it is on target to meet that. There may be, I understand, some variations in how that is done year by year -  - That sometimes happens. Occasionally you do not actually meet your full target in the first year, for example, but that does not alter the fact that Telstra's advice is that it is on track with its three-year program. The Besley report referred to - just to get this right - an average $700 million per year spend over three years. Telstra remains committed to that spend. Furthermore, it has said that, while it is adjusting the amount of spending for individual contractors, it has not reduced the level of customer access network expenditure overall. We, on this side, have consistently talked of and reflected in our public statements our commitment to the concerns of rural and regional and remote consumers over Telstra and its telecommunications standards, and our track record clearly backs that up. Every time the opposition - regardless of who it is in the opposition - get up and ask questions like this, we will go on reminding them that we have a record of a strong and universal service obligation. Telstra's customer service guarantee - which they did not have at all; we put it in place - attracts substantial fines when Telstra does not meet its obligations under that service guarantee. We can also point to funding programs totalling now around a billion dollars, and such outcomes as the $150 million tender for remote area call zones, which I think really highlight a much better set of outcomes - particularly where we have been able to usefully leverage competition - than the ALP ever considered when they were in government. But the clincher, of course, in evidencing their lack of concern for rural and regional Australia, was always the blase way in which they committed the country to the closing down of the analog network.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government has put in place a range of policies to build up quality education in government schools, because we believe that every young Australian has the right to a quality education, whether they are in the government sector or in the private sector. A particularly heavy responsibility, of course, rests also on state governments, which provide some 88 per cent of the funding for government schools. The Commonwealth seeks to work in a positive partnership with state governments. Unfortunately, not all state governments carry out their responsibilities as they should, and no state government has reneged more on its responsibilities to government schools than the Carr government in New South Wales. By the single, most important performance indicator of success or failure - the willingness of parents to choose a government school for their child - the Carr Labor government in New South Wales is a crashing failure. Indeed, this was pointed out by the Daily Telegraph last Friday, 2 March when this comment was made: If school enrolment was a subject, Education Minister John Aquilina would fail his HSC.He would fail his HSC because the New South Wales Labor government is failing to face up to the essential issues that confront government schools. It is this government which has put in place literacy and numeracy programs and the vocational education in schools programs, which in fact are the most positive developments in government schools in New South Wales. If you have a look at the funding commitments for government schools in New South Wales, in the last budget the Carr government increased its funding by a paltry 1.9 per cent compared with a 4.4 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding for government schools in New South Wales. The Commonwealth has recently announced an additional $115 million for government schools in New South Wales through the enrolment benchmark adjustment to ensure that those schools are in a position to offer students high quality maths, science and technology courses. If there were the slightest real interest in public education on the part of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party, they would be bringing pressure on the New South Wales government to lift its game and to restore its funding levels to government schools. But of course they do absolutely nothing. They have a pathetic policy of abolishing the EBA, a lazy policy of abolishing the EBA, which will simply funnel $115 million into the New South Wales Treasury, whereas our policy will ensure that the New South Wales government produces a plan to use that money in government schools. The lazy, serial non-performer on the other side of the table has absolutely no interest whatsoever in genuinely improving public education in this country, and there is a complete policy vacuum on that side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thought that the Deputy Prime Minister gave a very good answer, as the Deputy Prime Minister always does. To borrow a phrase, our position on this is well known. The government have indicated that we will not proceed to the full privatisation of Telstra until we are satisfied that arrangements exist to deliver adequate services in particular to rural and regional Australia. We have always made it clear that our commitment in relation to Telstra is conditional on that. The government's immediate priority is to get more services into rural and regional areas. The Deputy Prime Minister has detailed those, and they have been made possible by the sensible use of the proceeds of the second tranche. Although the allegations made by the shadow minister have been emphatically denied by Telstra, as indicated by the Deputy Prime Minister, the government at present are not satisfied that arrangements are in place and believe that more work needs to be done, including in the context of the response to the Besley inquiry into the adequacy of service levels in rural and regional areas. Our position on this issue is very clear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question, and I note that the Western Australian Labor government in her state is now trying to impose compulsory levies on students, let alone on workers. It is ACTU policy to force every non-unionist in this country to pay a $500 levy to the relevant trade union. If a company tried to charge people for services that they had not requested, it would be in breach of the trade practices legislation. Mr Speaker, if someone decided that your house needed a different coat of paint, proceeded to do the work without asking you and, when you came home, tried to charge you for it, that person would be guilty of a scam, pure and simple. They would be guilty of a scam.Last month, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission declined to remove a compulsory levy clause from a certified agreement even though it held that this was designed to coerce people to join the union. In effect, it held that these clauses were compulsory unionism by the back door and that they amounted to the creation of a Claytons closed shop. I can inform the House that the Employment Advocate has decided to appeal this decision after receiving further legal advice that these clauses contravene fundamental freedom of association principles. If the ACTU succeeds in this campaign, 5.7 million Australians who are not members of a trade union face a $500-a-year union tax. Where do members opposite stand? The opposition are fatally compromised on this matter, because in the last financial year Labor received $583,000 from the trade union at the heart of this dispute. No wonder they want a compulsory union levy: so they can recycle the money to the Labor Party. Unless the Leader of the Opposition repudiates this policy of the ACTU, unless the Leader of the Opposition says exactly where he stands, he will be guilty of having his hands deeply in the pockets of every Australian worker.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I am aware of a recent report, the publication of which had been, to put it politely, delayed for at least a year by the European Union. It was a report carried out by the Netherlands economic institute on the impact of the European sugar industry. Coalition members and others from Queensland would be particularly aware of the impact of the European sugar policy, which was established in 1968, on sugar industries around the world. This most recent report that was done by a respected economics institute in the Netherlands shows that the European Union in 1998-99 spent $2.6 billion, in Australian dollar terms, on subsidies for just five million tonnes of sugar and that the measures used by the European Union include minimum guaranteed prices, import levies, production levies and preferential arrangements for the importation of raw sugar from former colonies of EC members.According to the report - and this is a Netherlands report - EU sugar production is now 10 per cent higher than EU sugar consumption, EU producers receive prices at least twice as high as the average world market price, the average cost of EU sugar is two to three times higher than that of its main competitors, and without subsidised EU sugar production the world market would be 46 per cent larger, world prices higher and the price level more stable. This drives home to Australians two points. It drives home the extraordinarily difficult trading circumstances in which the Australian sugar industry operates and the extremely unfair impact on all Australian primary producers of the distorted trading policies of the European Union. It also underscores the wisdom and the responsiveness of the government's sugar package of $83 million which was announced by the minister for agriculture a few months ago, which provides interest subsidies to assist in planting cane and running the business, family relief payments and assistance in financial management and planning. This is another piece of evidence that, despite great efficiencies by world standards, Australian primary producers are constantly being hobbled by the unfair trading, subsidy and economic policies of the European Union. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. I have actually seen reports from various state premiers and treasurers in relation to their capacity to reduce tax on petrol, but none of those comments have been convincing. As I informed the House yesterday -  - The federal Labor Party interjection in support of the state premiers is a very interesting proposition. Under the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, clause C2, the Commonwealth is obliged to pay to the states and the territories as a guaranteed minimum amount financial assistance grants, revenue replacement payments and state and territory taxes as defined. The revenue replacement payments are the equivalent of the business franchise fees that the states used to impose before the fees were struck down by the High Court. In particular, the revenue replacement fee is 8.35c per litre, which the Commonwealth is obliged to collect and pay to each of the state governments under the guaranteed minimum amount. Each and every one of those states receives from the Commonwealth the equivalent of 8.35c per litre under clause C2 of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations. That being the case, if a state premier or a state treasurer were legitimately concerned about the taxation of fuel, they have the capacity to reduce by 8.35c per litre the taxation of fuel in their state. There is one state premier who did it. The Queensland state Premier tried to abolish his previously existing subsidy, was caught by the Commonwealth and reintroduced it. I am legitimately perturbed by the claims from some states that they do not have the capacity to do it. For example, New South Wales insists that the Commonwealth pay to it $707 million, being 8.35c per litre on the fuel which is sold in New South Wales. It has the capacity to return all of that to its motorists, but it returns only $47 million. If the New South Wales Premier and New South Wales Treasurer are legitimately concerned about tax on petrol, they have the opportunity to give motorists in New South Wales a 7.2c cut in the tax on petrol. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot come to Canberra and insist that they be paid 8.35c and then go back to their states and say that they have no capacity to reduce taxation. They could reduce it by 7.2c tomorrow.Even more bizarre were the claims by the Victorian Premier, Mr Bracks, on the Mitchell program on 6 March 2001 - today. He was asked this question:You do get compensation for the petrol taxes you don't collect - that is, that are collected by the Commonwealth.This is the answer:BRACKS: Yeah, but we get a bundle.Too right they get a bundle.BRACKS: That's right the High Court decision made the franchise fees illegal.MITCHELL: So the feds collected it and said we'll give it back to you.BRACKS: Which was the case in every state in Australia except Queensland ...MITCHELL: So they're giving it back to you at the rate of 6.6 ...Actually we are giving it back at the rate of 8.35.BRACKS: Yeah but it's in a bundle ...MITCHELL: But can't it be cut out of the bundle and given to the motorist?BRACKS: Can it be cut out of the bundle? Well the reality is we're being dudded ...Let me explain for the benefit of Premier Bracks how he can cut it out of his bundle. The Commonwealth is obliged to pay to the state of Victoria, according to the budget papers, $5.69 billion. Out of that bundle, $507 million is for the petrol excise. Mr Bracks pays back to the motorist $38 million. He has the capacity to return the remaining $469 million and cut the petrol excise in Victoria by 6.6c per litre. If Mr Bracks finds it too hard to cut the sum of $469 million out of his bundle, out of his $5.69 billion, here is an offer I make him: I will send him a separate cheque for the $469 million. I will cut it out of the bundle if he will undertake to return it to the motorist.It is not that hard to take $469 million out of the $5.69 billion. I could live with this argument if Premier Bracks were honest and said, `The truth of the matter is I want to keep the 8.35c per litre.' That would be an honest position. But what I cannot live with is a state premier who comes to Canberra, demands that he be paid 8.35c per litre, is paid $507 million and then wants to pretend that he is worried about the taxation of petrol. If he is worried about the taxation of petrol, we will cut it out of his bundle, and he can return it to the motorist. - What I am suggesting is simply this: those Labor Party premiers who want to go on the radio and say that the petrol excise should be cut have the capacity to do it, and while they refuse to do it their grandstanding is complete hypocrisy. That is what I am saying, and we note that the Labor Party is full of defending the Labor states on keeping petrol excise, while saying that the coalition should pay it back. That is the Labor Party position. What I am saying is this: Premier Bracks, Premier Carr and Treasurer Egan cannot have it both ways. If they want to pretend that they are worried about tax on petrol, they can cut it. If they refuse to cut it, they should not go around pretending that they are worried about the tax on petrol - it is nothing but sheer hypocrisy. </DOC>

 - The government has made it perfectly clear that it is concerned about the potential quantum increase in the accessibility of gambling services, so it decided to take action. For that reason, it introduced the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000. The main purpose of the moratorium is to halt the development of the interactive gambling industry in Australia while the government investigates the feasibility of a permanent ban. The government's actions are to restrict gambling -  - Suggestions by the honourable member that the government is trying to protect the offline pokie industry by banning online pokies is absurd. As contained in your earlier question, regulation of offline gaming, including regulation of electronic gaming machines or pokies, is a state and territory issue. The Commonwealth is showing national leadership in regard to its powers under the Constitution, and the Minister for Family and Community Services has been chairing the Ministerial Council on Gambling. No doubt you have checked the members register. You will see that I have fully disclosed my interests in this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his question. I know, from discussions I have had with him, the keen interest he takes in the small businesses in his electorate of Menzies. The Howard led government is committed to ensuring that small business remains the engine room of Australia's economy and, as part of that process, we are keen to ensure that we deliver to small business the sorts of reforms they ask for. Small business is one of the big supporters of tax reform in Australia. Small business has already benefited from the receipt of income tax cuts and, of course, the abolition of the very inefficient wholesale sales tax and its replacement with an input credit scheme through the GST.On the issue of fuel, we have delivered to small business significant cuts in excise and taxes. On 1 July, under the new tax system, we introduced a cut to excise from 44.1c to 37.4c - a cut of 6.7c. I am sure the Treasurer would agree that it would be good if the states would look at their own excises to see whether they can cut them as well. Further to that, last week we delivered a cut of some 1.5c to excise right across the board. Again, I am sure the Treasurer would agree that, if the states even matched that, it would be seen by the motorists in those states as a welcome move. What this amounts to is a saving to small business on excise and taxes of some 7½ to 8c a litre every time they fill up.We would like to know what is the Labor Party's policy on excise and the changes we have introduced. The Labor Party opposed these changes every inch of the way, to the point where the shadow Minister for Small Business is on the record as saying that the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme should be abolished. The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme delivers to small business and consumers in regional Australia savings of 1c to 2c a litre, and the Labor Party want to abolish it. The Labor Party is a party for higher fuel tax.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. I know that he has a very keen interest in the welfare of constituents in his electorate, particularly those who are actively looking for employment. The government has a very firm but fair view when it comes to helping genuine job seekers seeking Newstart allowance. It is terribly important that they get their full entitlement - nothing more and nothing less. That is why it is very pleasing that, in the last financial year - 1999-2000 - 86 per cent of those individuals receiving Newstart allowance did the right thing: they attended to their mutual obligations, they attended their interviews and they declared their earnings.Of course, we are concerned about the other 14 per cent - those individuals who may be breached. It is interesting that, when you look at the figures, of those on a second breach 2.6 per cent are in that category and only 1.1 per cent are on a third breach. This is significantly different from when the Labor Party was in government. There was one breach and that was it - you lost 100 per cent of your payment. We were requested by ACOSS to have a fairer scheme and this was supported by the Australian Labor Party. What we have done, particularly for Newstart recipients - those between 18 and 34 - is introduce a Work for the Dole scheme, which has been highly successful. We also introduced Job Network and we have introduced a preparing for work agreement to ensure that job seekers know their rights and responsibilities. There is an appeal process. If people do feel as though they may have been breached incorrectly, they can appeal. What is interesting is that, of those appeals, only 2.6 are actually appealed and less than one-third are set aside.We are also very cognisant that, if people are homeless, if they have a drug dependency or if they have a mental illness, of course they are exempt from this breaching regime. We want fairness. The Labor Party's record of fairness is that, when they breached someone, that person lost 100 per cent of their entitlements straightaway. In the last year that the Labor Party was in government, 86,000 people lost their total entitlement, which is well over four times the number for the current regime. That was their policy on breaching. When it came to fraud, they let it go unchecked. They had sloppy compliance mechanisms. And the bottom line: Working Nation was also a total failure. Labor never encouraged people back to work; they were happy to let them languish on social security payments.</DOC>

 - I would have to do my own calculations. I have this disturbing habit that, when the opposition puts a proposition to me based on some of their arithmetic, I like to go away and do a little checking of my own. I do not know why; I just want to do that. Maybe it has to do with the habits of the opposition. But let me just return the Leader of the Opposition to the way in which the rent assistance operates. The rent assistance scheme in its present form was introduced in 1993. As a result of that scheme's operation over the years, it is my understanding that every time there is a periodic adjustment, several thousand people can be affected, including `adversely affected'. So the fact that somebody's rent assistance goes up and down is a function of the periodic indexation of the threshold. - The Treasurer reminds me that this adjustment is something that is part and parcel of a scheme. Unless you have a rent adjustment scheme - and I do not hear the opposition suggesting this - that never involves any kind of adjustment of the threshold, then of course you might have a different outcome. But I do not hear the Labor Party advocating that. When they introduced the scheme, that was not an element of it. I will still go away and check the arithmetic, but it would appear to me that the Leader of the Opposition is complaining about the operation of a policy that his government, prior to 1996, introduced.   - No, the loss of this money is due to the adjustment of the rent assistance threshold, not to the operation of the government's taxation system. It is your rent threshold that is being adjusted. That is the reason why this family - and I would have to go away and do the arithmetic - could be affected in the way that the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting. </DOC>

 - May I say that departmental officials certainly ask much better questions than members opposite. - Catholic schoolboys of my acquaintance, of my generation, used to recite the poetry of Monsignor P.J. Hartigan - some members opposite might remember it - and one of those poems had a refrain, from memory, something like this: `We'll all be rooned,' said Hanrahan, `before the year is out.'Roonism - the view that life is bad and getting worse - is a mutant sibling of the tall poppy syndrome and it risks poisoning Australian public life. One of the worst features -  - One of the worst features of the roonism practised by members opposite is that they run down Australia in order to build up themselves. They knock their country -  - They knock their country in order to try to get a cheap political advantage themselves. The latest example of this `roonism' is an ACTU survey purporting to show how bad life is in contemporary Australia. There are three serious problems with this survey. First of all, it is from an obviously self-interested source; second, it contains, apparently, doctored figures; and, third, it peddles urban myths masquerading as facts. This ACTU survey was conducted by the Australian Labor Party's private pollster, handpicked by Paul Keating, which receives about a million dollars a year courtesy of the Australian Labor Party. When this material first appeared on the ACTU's web site on Friday, 2 March, this so-called authoritative survey said: ... 34% of Australians indicate that they have less job security. By Monday, 5 March the survey said:... 43% of employees are less secure in their job.What happened last weekend to cause job insecurity to rise by nearly one-third? Obviously nothing happened. This is the kind of survey where you pay your money and you get the exact result that you want. Sharan Burrow gave the game away when she said on the ABC yesterday:We wanted to validate a blueprint for fairness that we put out this afternoon. Plainly, this ACTU survey is nothing but a crude exercise in push polling. The fact is that workers do not have more job insecurity; this government has created 800,000 jobs. Living standards have not fallen; average weekly earnings are up by 12 per cent under this government. Spending on education has not been cut; in fact, it is up by one-third. On the evidence of this survey, the one thing you cannot do is trust the ACTU. You cannot trust the ACTU and you cannot trust the political party which the unions own, operate and funded to the tune of $5.7 million in the last financial year.</DOC>

 - I do not accept the allegation made by the member for Lilley. I will, naturally, as I always do, investigate it. If there is anything further to add to what I have said, I will. I might, just in passing, mention that the Age Pension News of March-April 2000 contained information regarding the operation of the advance payment in relation to the increase in the pension. While I am on my feet, if it is allowed by you, Mr Speaker, I would like to say that I have not completed the independent arithmetical analysis of the question of the Leader of the Opposition, but I do have a sort of advance instalment on that process which may be of some assistance to honourable members. I think the leader asked me about a single income family on $28,000 with three children. I think that is what he asked me, and I think he mentioned a rent adjustment of somewhere in the order of $4 a fortnight. My advice is that a single income family on $30,000 a year with three children, when you take into account the extra family assistance and the tax cuts, is $70.39 a week better off - $70.39 a week better off.  - `It's not the point,' he said. Oh, no, of course it is not the point! - I repeat that this family is $70.39 a week better off as a result -  - They are $70.39 a week better off than they would have been if you had been in government. Not only are they $70.39 a week better off as a result of tax reform but also families in a similar situation are significantly better off because of the lower mortgage interest rates that obtain in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. I am aware of the Queensland Teachers Union's announcement yesterday that it plans to distribute to Queensland parents a leaflet that contains what can only be described as an outrageous collection of lies and misrepresentations regarding federal government school funding arrangements. I call on the state Minister for Education in Queensland to ensure that this blatant piece of political propaganda is not distributed through schools in that state. Amongst the outrageous claims in the leaflet -  -  - The other side will defend to the death the right of unions to politicise Australian schools, but you will not hear a peep from the Leader of the Opposition when unions go out disrupting basic literacy tests that are fundamental to the future of Australian children. The union party is all about spreading disinformation and not about advancing the interests of Australian schoolchildren and protecting the rights of Australian parents.Amongst the outrageous claims in this leaflet is that the Howard government has cut funding to government schools in Queensland. In fact, the reverse is the truth. The Howard government is providing record levels of funding to government schools in Queensland. Commonwealth funding to government schools in Queensland this year now stands at a record $416.5 million, a 6.6 per cent increase over last year and a 44 per cent increase over 1996. In other words, there has been a massive infusion of funds by the Howard government into public education in Queensland. By contrast, it is the state Labor government, which has the principal responsibility for funding government schools, that is short-changing public education in Queensland. I illustrate this by pointing out that the last Queensland state budget increased government school funding from state sources by less than one per cent.This outrageous leaflet from the Queensland Teachers Union also peddles the furphy that state schools receive only 35 per cent of total federal funding. The reality is that over 60 per cent of the money that flows to schools through the Commonwealth budget identified grants and financial assistance grants goes to government schools. It is also a fact that government schools nationwide get more than three times as much funding as non-government schools: public funding for government schools is around $13 billion per annum for the two million students in those schools whereas non-government schools receive $3 billion per annum for the one million students in those schools.The Queensland Teachers Union says it intends to distribute this political propaganda on behalf of the federal Labor Party through state schools to parents. I call once again on the Queensland state minister to give instructions to school principals in that state that this political propaganda is not to be distributed through schools. Should the state government refuse to do this and allow the distribution of this propaganda, I will be asking the Queensland state government to ensure that the federal government's response to this outrageous information will equally be distributed to parents in Queensland so they can hear the truth.</DOC>

 - You certainly cannot take anything for granted from the member for Grayndler, particularly with those comments. But what is important for pensioners, particularly pensioners living in mobile home parks, is that the figure they are getting today in pension reimbursement is $30 more than they would have got in June last year and indeed is significantly more than if the Australian Labor Party were in government. In regard to indexation and rent assistance, as the Prime Minister pointed out, this was a policy introduced by the Australian Labor Party back in 1993 to ensure adequate indexation between the minimum threshold and the lower threshold.I will have a look at the member for Grayndler's question. But, as I said before, we can never believe what you say. You always masquerade as a caravan park tenant, and of course you should spend more time in your own electorate representing your own people, who benefited dramatically from the 10 per cent increase in the maximum threshold that we provided.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Accessing Medicare has always been difficult, particularly when we simply had Medicare offices which were not able to be located in all the areas they were needed. That is why one of our initiatives on coming to government was to bring in Medicare Ezyclaim facilities in pharmacies. These have been particularly popular. We now have nearly 600 pharmacies in Australia with Medicare Ezyclaim facilities, and we have plans for the roll-out of another 200 over the coming months. This will mean that there are nearly 800 locations in Australia where people can directly access the Health Insurance Commission for Medicare claims in ways they were not possibly able to do so before.The location of Medicare offices in their electorates is something that is keenly sought by local members. My attention was grabbed late last week when someone forwarded to me an advertisement from the Port Stephens Examiner of Wednesday, 28 February 1996 - three days before the 1996 election. The advertisement says:Bob Horne MPNelson Bay Medicare office opensBob Horne and Labor are committed to making Medicare even better for local families. That is why Bob Horne fought so hard to get a Medicare office opened in Nelson Bay.There is only one problem with that: there is no Medicare office in Nelson Bay. It never opened; it never happened. -  - We have Bob Horne, the local member, three days before the election claiming that a Medicare office in Nelson Bay has opened - an election advertisement saying that this is the case. You can imagine my surprise when I got a letter from one of his constituents who claimed they had been walking around the shopping centre looking for it - but it had never happened. The second part of this is that the member for Paterson also says how hard he worked to get this Medicare office open - an office which in fact does not exist. So I thought that I would check with the Health Insurance Commission as to how much representation it had received from the member for Paterson in his very hard work to get this fictitious Medicare office to open. It is true - he did write one letter to the Health Insurance Commission in three years, and he got a reply from the parliamentary secretary to the minister at the time, the member for Calwell, saying, `No, we can't do it, we're never going to do it, and we can't open part-time offices because they're inefficient.' The fact is that today the people of Nelson Bay do have two claiming facilities in pharmacies. They do have access that they never had before. I am happy to table the advertisement for this fictitious Medicare office, which was published three days before the 1996 election. The member for Paterson has a bit of explaining to do. </DOC>

 - As I said to the House yesterday, obviously there have been transitional and one-off factors brought about by tax changes, and this is a point that the government has made on many occasions. For example, in relation to the construction industry, there was a huge bring-forward of construction work into the March and June quarters of 2000. In fact, construction at that point was, as a proportion of the economy, at some 20-year high. Obviously, once you had had a huge bring-forward in the March and the June quarters, that would be unwound in the September and the December quarters, as we have seen. And, as I told the House yesterday, we have just seen in the most recent trend figures the building approvals market pick up again.Conversely, there were changes the other way. For example, I can recall in the lead-up to June-July 2000 motor car manufacturers bemoaning a lack of sales as people held off because cars became cheaper under the new system. That again was a one-off matter where, in that case, purchases were put back. Since the new taxation system has come into effect, in relation to motor car sales, July was the highest July on record, August was the highest August on record, October was the highest October on record -  -  - The Labor Party used to tax cars at 22 per cent - wholesale sales tax. Once you abolished wholesale sales tax and introduced 10 per cent GST -  - cars became cheaper, so anybody who knew that the tax change was going on held back prior to 1 July. I am saying that you have these transitional, one-off factors. July was the highest July on record, August was the highest August on record, October was the highest October on record, November was the highest November on record and December -  - These are the motor vehicle registration figures. - The member for Hotham wants to say that nobody believes the VFACTS industry summary of motor registrations. These are independent statistical facts. They may be inconvenient to the Labor Party, but they are independent statistical facts. November was the highest November on record, December was the highest December on record and January was the highest January on record. We have always said that there are going to be one-off and transitional factors. There are some things that were put back - electricals, cars - which are now catching up. There are some things that were brought forward. In particular, construction was brought forward for very strong months in March and June. We have always said that you would have one-off and transitional factors which would be displayed in the September and the December national accounts. We expect that by the time of the current quarter, the March national accounts, you will be getting a much clearer picture of where the economy actually stands. The economy will be stronger throughout the course of this year than it otherwise would have been, because this government cut tax. The Australian Labor Party opposed the taxation changes on the grounds not that they would mug the economy but that they would overheat it. They spent the whole of the year 2000 saying, `You are giving away too much in income tax cuts; you are overheating the economy.' Today they want to say, `Oh, no, no, no. We were wrong about that. It was not giving away too much; it has had the reverse effect.' As I said yesterday, the Labor Party have the ability to hold mutually inconsistent positions simultaneously and be wrong about both of them.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Wannon for something more than a passing interest in banking. In his capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, he is well recognised around Australia as a leading authority on banking regulation. Richard Viney released his bank appointed review of the banking code of practice yesterday. The government views this paper as a very significant report, because it identifies for the banks key community concerns about consumers and banking. There were a large number of recommendations in the report, but some of the key recommendations, which we are encouraging the banks to respond to as quickly as possible, include that credit should not be extended to those people who cannot afford to repay it. Why should you extend the credit card limit when you know that people cannot repay the money? Secondly, guarantors should be properly informed of their legal and financial obligations to the bank. Thirdly, banks should better disclose low fee, low cost accounts for those most financially disadvantaged in the community. Fourthly, the banking code of practice should incorporate the principle of fairness - this is commonsense - and that, under the banking code, small business should have the same rights as individuals. One of the more significant recommendations is that - and this was taken out of the Hawker report into banking - it was recognised that the banks should implement a three-month consultation period with the local community before they decide to close a branch. All members on this side of the House would welcome community consultation by the banks before they take any actions that may disadvantage a community. The Viney report is a 200-page report with 12 pages of recommendations covering a range of areas from electronic banking to staff training. We are encouraging the banks to think not only of their shareholders but most importantly of their customers. I need to confess to the House that I might have inadvertently misled some members on 6 February when I advised that the Viney committee had received 26 submissions and none of them were from the federal Labor Party. In fact, I was wrong. Viney received 56 submissions and none of them were from the federal Labor Party - not one. Yesterday in response to the report, the Labor Party put out a press release - believe this - saying that the Viney report was a missed opportunity when, of 56 submissions, not one came from the federal Labor Party. It is not as though the federal Labor Party did not have time. The ALP had since 12 May last year to put in a submission; that is, 10 months - 43 weeks or 298 days, in case it needs to be simplified, or 7,152 hours - to put in a submission. The Labor Party did not contribute one zack to the report on banking commissioned by the banks. Why didn't the Labor Party put in a report? Why didn't the Labor Party put in a submission? - The Leader of the Opposition is saying that he cannot trust the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to put in something that is informative. It is a policy-lazy opposition. On something as important to the community as banking, the Labor Party has no contribution to make, and that says a lot about a policy-lazy Labor Party.</DOC>

 - Exports have grown 21 per cent over the year to January. That is the point I made yesterday. The member for Hotham may say that a 21 per cent increase in exports is not booming. I would love to know the figure that he would point to during the six years he sat on the front bench of the Labor Party from 1990 to 1996 that compares with the 21 per cent increase in exports. During the six years that he sat on the front bench, the Labor Party government accumulated $80,000 million in deficits. We are quite happy to stand up here and talk about the economy because, during the period when the member for Hotham sat on the Labor Party front bench with the then minister for employment, unemployment was 11.3 per cent. Today it is 6.7 per cent. When I spoke about jobs last November I would have made this point. - The unemployment rate today is 6.7 per cent. He says that is collapsing. When this government came to office, the unemployment rate was 8.7 per cent and 800,000 people have since been put into work. That is presumably a collapsing labour market - an additional 800,000 jobs! In the six years during which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition sat on the front bench of the Labor Party, the record low for unemployment was 8.7 per cent. Their record high, of course, was 11.3 per cent.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition can stand up here and say, `Exports have only grown by 21 per cent, unemployment has only fallen to 6.7 per cent, interest rates are only 7½ per cent.' You have got to compare a 7½ per cent interest rate with the alternative. If you really want to compare it with the alternative, we can remember the Labor Party's record: 17 per cent. We can remember an overdraft rate of 21 per cent. You have got to compare the current economic outcomes: an interest rate of 7½ per cent, unemployment at 6.7 per cent, a budget which is now in surplus, $50 billion of the Labor Party's $80 billion worth of debt repaid in five years and exports up 21 per cent. I said earlier that you are going to get reflected in both the September and the December quarters of the national accounts one-off and transitional factors, not only because of bring-forwards and push-backs through the taxation changes but because of the changes in relation to the Olympics. The thing that this economy needs is good economic management: budgets which are in surplus, interest rates which are low and unemployment which has fallen in a way which the Australian Labor Party could never dream of.</DOC>

 - I recognise the honourable member for Aston's interest in this important issue. The Australian government deplores the threatened act of cultural vandalism proposed by the Taliban extremists in Afghanistan. If they were to carry out the threats that they have made, and there is some evidence that they have begun to do so already, then that would constitute the most disgraceful act of cultural vandalism outside of wartime and I think deserves to be totally condemned by the international community. The Bamyan statues not only are considered Afghanistan's best-known archaeological treasures but are of very great importance to the whole of the world. They date back about 1,500 years, and the tallest statue, which is more than 50 metres high, is the tallest standing Buddha in the world and is one of the tallest statues of any kind in the world.  Our government, along with many others, calls on the Taliban to respect the cultural and spiritual heritage of all religious groups and to cease all further acts of destruction. A number of organisations and countries have condemned what the Taliban have been doing and have called for them to cease forthwith. That includes, not surprisingly, UNESCO but also the United States, the European Union, a range of Buddhist countries and, interestingly enough, Afghanistan's neighbours Iran and Pakistan. Indeed, members may be interested to know that Iran offered to buy those statues in order to try to ensure their preservation. A special United Nations envoy has visited Afghanistan to persuade the Taliban to save these irreplaceable parts of the world's cultural heritage. I am sure all Australians deplore this act of cultural vandalism by the Taliban. We feel in particular for those members of the Buddhist community in Australia who have been affected emotionally by this very distressing affair.</DOC>

 - This government is very conscious of the impact on dairy farmers around Australia of dairy deregulation and has been working with the industry to endeavour to make the transition to the new arrangements as smooth as possible. I can report to the House that almost 99 per cent of dairy farmers have now received the notices indicating to them the amount of payments that they will receive under the federal government's restructuring package and 86 per cent have now been paid at least their first two instalments.The honourable member also asked whether there are any alternative policies. I have noticed three alternative policies coming from the Labor Party over the last couple of weeks and it has been quite interesting to follow these alternative policies because they seem to be all over the shop. Just yesterday, the Queensland minister for agriculture, Henry Palaszczuk, put out a new plan to assist dairy farmers. Here we have the Queensland minister who deregulated the industry in the state of Queensland, who provided absolutely no compensation whatsoever to the Queensland industry, proposing a five-point plan to assist the industry and - wouldn't you know it? - all five points involve more money from the Commonwealth. An extra $200 million from the Commonwealth is Henry Palaszczuk's plan to assist the dairy industry. It is interesting that he does not seem to quite have his plan in line with that announced by the Leader of the Opposition during that boondoggle bus trip up to northern New South Wales. Amongst the Queensland minister's plans is a proposal to spend another $45 million on a dairy regional adjustment program. That is a program that the Leader of the Opposition proposed to slash by $20 million under his plan for the industry, and to spend the money on training schemes that this government has been funding out of FarmBis.  Some interesting comments have also been made on this issue by another expert on dairy industry policy, the member for Werriwa. As often is the case, when we are looking for a bit of honesty in this field we have to go to the member for Werriwa. To the member for Werriwa's credit, when he was speaking on the John Stanley show following his notorious article in the press last week, where he condemned all taxation concessions to agriculture and said that farmers should be paying more tax, he was questioned on some of these issues. I do not want to be critical of the member for Werriwa, because for the first time at least he acknowledged who was responsible for dairy deregulation - in fact, he praised the Bracks Labor government and his state Labor colleagues because, he said, they are the ones who kicked off dairy deregulation. At last we have, contrary to the comments by the shadow minister and the member for Paterson, at least an acknowledgment that it was the state governments that introduced dairy deregulation. He went on to say:I have not got any dairy farmers in my electorate.Surprise, surprise!But what I have got is the lowest milk prices on record. You can now go down to Duffy Brothers at Campbelltown and buy two litres of milk for $1.90. Now we haven't seen prices like that since the 1980s, and I was talking to a family in my electorate that has got seven children and they buy six litres of milk a day - that is a $10 to $15 a week saving from this policy. You see, I defend the interests of consumers in my electorate; they do not want to pay subsidies through to dairy farmers. They want a competitive industry and a bit of price competition.So, on the one hand, we have Henry Palaszczuk, the minister in Queensland, calling for an extension of the federal government levy on milk, the tax, and we have the honourable member for Werriwa saying he wants to abolish it altogether. It is about time that Labor made their policy clear. It is pretty obvious that, under Labor, dairy farmers could expect to get absolutely nothing. They would get the same treatment federally that they have got at state level - the industry is deregulated, but absolutely no compensation. They have no plan for dairy farmers. They have no commitment to the industry. They have a confused mishmash of policies that will deliver absolutely nothing to dairy farmers.</DOC>

 - I have seen today's figures. Those figures are disappointing. Those figures, of course, are for one quarter, and a setback in one quarter does not in any way destroy the strength, the growth and the progress of the last five years. It does not destroy in any way the fact that this government has repaid $50 billion of debt that we inherited from you, it does not alter the fact that the government debt position of this country is probably stronger than it has been at any time since World War II, and it does not alter the position that we have about as low a government debt to GDP ratio as it is prudent to have. The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about the impact of the tax package on the Australian economy. I am grateful that the Leader of the Opposition has asked that question. It allows me to remind the House -  - I find it very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition seeks in some way to sever the tax cuts from the GST. It was an exercise in semantics that the shadow minister for finance was not prepared to adopt when he addressed AMP representatives on 1 May last year and said:With economic growth at around 4 percent, an annual fiscal stimulus of around $6 billion over three years from the GST package (variously estimated to be equivalent to between 0.25 and 0.5 per cent of GDP) is not appropriate at this stage of the cycle ...Not to be outdone, the Leader of the Opposition himself said in February last year:... the net fiscal stimulus in this tax package of more than $6 billion in the first year alone, and around $20 billion over three years, runs the risk of fuelling consumption and overheating the economy.Typical of a man who would seek to walk both sides of the street on every issue, what the Leader of the Opposition has sought to do is, on the one hand, when he thought it suited his political convenience, argue that the tax package was overheating the economy and now argue, because of his own political opportunism, something that is the opposite. That is exactly what he does. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot last year say that the tax package would overheat the economy and now turn around and ask us to accept that the tax package has in fact mugged the economy. The reality is that this quarter's negative figure, which I said at the beginning is a disappointment, does not in any way alter the fact that, over the last five years, the policies of this government -  - The policies of this government have delivered a stronger Australian economy. This government has had the courage -   - Today's figures, as the Treasurer indicated at his press conference, are the product of a number of developments in the economy, including some of the transitional impacts of the introduction of the new taxation system. There has been a significant downturn in the housing industry, and that has certainly contributed to the downturn in economic activity. The welcome news in that particular department is that over the past two months there have been signs that the downturn has finished, and there are some very tentative signs of recovery. One of the things that will build upon those tentative signs of recovery is the announcement today by the Reserve Bank that there has been a further reduction of a quarter of a per cent in official interest rates. One of the reasons why I make the claim, without any fear of contradiction, that the last five years have delivered a stronger and better Australia is that average housing mortgages now attract a monthly repayment of $267 less than they did when the Leader of the Opposition ceased to be the finance minister of this country. Everyone remembers that a hallmark of the last time the Leader of the Opposition was a member of a government in this country was that we had 11 per cent unemployment, we had 17 per cent interest rates and we had a government debt of $85 billion. I repeat that today's figures are a disappointment - undeniably a disappointment - but a setback in one quarter does not destroy the additional strength, the additional progress and the underlying flexibility that has been delivered to this economy by the policies of the government over the last five years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can advise the House that in the December quarter, seasonally adjusted, GDP declined by 0.6 per cent, which is obviously a very disappointing result. It comes off the back of a period of very strong growth, particularly over the last four years where growth has been continuously above four per cent. What the GDP figures for the December quarter illustrate is that household consumption grew, although it grew at less strength than has been the case throughout 1998 and 1999 when it was growing at about one per cent per quarter, whereas it grew at about 0.5 per cent in the December quarter.The part of the national accounts which illustrated the largest fall was in relation to dwelling investment, which fell by 15.4 per cent in the December quarter. Interestingly, dwelling construction represents around five per cent of the national accounts. If you take dwellings out of the national accounts - that is, you abstract the falls in dwellings in both the September and the December quarters - the remaining part of the national accounts, some 95 per cent of the national accounts, grew by 2.1 per cent in two quarters or by an annualised rate of 4.2 per cent for the year. - In other words, 95 per cent of the economy showed good strong growth, but it was the five per cent of the economy, namely, the dwelling part of the economy -  - which, when added back into the national accounts, meant that over those two quarters they were in total a negative of minus two per cent. Dwelling construction and investment I think was affected by two things. The first is that there were obviously transitional effects from the new tax system. The new tax system pulled forward construction in the housing sector into March and June where construction in the housing sector in those two quarters was around the highest level in 20 years. Conversely, as that unwound in the September and December quarters, you saw those large falls which have influenced today's national accounts. The second factor which has obviously influenced the housing investment figures is interest rates, which were rising through much of last year. As they were rising through much of last year, one could expect a drop-off in relation to housing approvals finance and, ultimately, construction. The good news is, as the Prime Minister said, trends in both housing building approvals and housing finance now appear to have turned up. That speaks well for construction around the middle of the year. Interest rates have fallen again today, which will also be positive for the housing industry, and there are tentative signs that that will recover. May I make it clear to the House that corporate balance sheets appear to be in a strong position, the profit share of income is around historically high levels, credit is available, exports are growing and inflation is low: all positive signs for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - In the course of the financial year unemployment has fallen and given more people jobs. In fact, since this government has come to office, there are nearly 800,000 people in work who could not find work under the Australian Labor Party. Not only have we put the budget position into surplus but we have used those surpluses to repay the Labor Party's debt. I have made this point before to the House. But imagine if you were running a budget that was not carrying $80 billion of Labor Party debt. Imagine the way in which you would have been able to cut taxes if you did not have to service $80 billion of Beazley-Keating-Crean debt - the interest bills that we had to ask taxpayers to pay.The government's record is: unemployment today is significantly down on what it was under the Labor Party. When we came to office, it was 8.7 per cent; today it is 6.7 per cent. Interest rates are significantly lower than they were under the Australian Labor Party. Today you can get an interest rate of 7.3; when the government was elected it was 10.5. Budgets have been in surplus over the last three years, including this year - unlike the Labor Party which ran five years of accumulated deficits. And nearly 800,000 additional people are in work. The shadow Treasurer likes to go back and look at what people were saying last year in relation to growth and in relation to the economy -  - I will make the point again: all of the Labor Party's complaints last year against the government's economic management were that we were overheating the economy. The member for Hotham said this on 27 January 2000: After all it's his GST package which is ramping up inflationary expectations and causing a multi-billion dollar fiscal loosening. Last year the government was attacked for `fiscal loosening'; today it is attacked for `mugging the economy' - completely inconsistent and contradictory positions. - I conclude on that quote from the member for Hotham, who damns himself out of his own mouth. He spent the whole of last year attacking this government for giving income tax cuts which were too small, and today he wants to argue the contrary. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that today the Reserve Bank of Australia cut official interest rates by 25 basis points. Nearly all of the banks and other mortgage providers, such as Aussie Home Loans, have announced immediate reductions in their standard variable interest rates, bringing standard variable interest rates down to 7.3 per cent. That is good news for Australian homebuyers, and it will be good news for the home building industry. A mortgage interest rate of 7.3 per cent compares with a mortgage interest rate of 10.5 per cent when the government was elected. During 13 years of Labor Party government, from March 1983 to March 1996, interest rates were never as low as 7.3 per cent. During 13 years of Labor Party government, including during the period when the Labor Party gave Australia the worst recession in 60 years, the standard variable mortgage interest rate was never as low as 7.3 per cent. I have here a list of standard variable mortgage interest rates, which I am prepared to table. It shows that in March 1996, when the government was elected, the standard variable mortgage interest rate was 10.5 per cent. During the period going back to 1983, the rates peaked in 1989 and 1990 at a point of 17 per cent. I repeat: standard variable mortgage interest rates in 1989 and 1990 peaked at a level of 17 per cent. For the average Australian mortgage of $100,000, today's interest rate cut illustrates a monthly saving overall of about $270 a month from those figures as applied in March 1996. If you were on 10.5 per cent in March 1996 and today you are on 7.3 per cent, on a $100,000 mortgage you are now saving in after-tax money $270 a month - $270 a month for young home buyers, $270 a month for families. Today the cut of 0.25 per cent will save them around $20 a month in interest. As I said, this is an historical low in interest rates. To get back to a seven per cent rate, other than during the period of this government, you would have to go back to September 1973 before the Whitlam Labor government got to the economy. I am prepared to table that list. Today's announcement is good news for Australian home buyers.</DOC>

 - When this government was elected it legislated the charter of budget honesty, and it legislated it to insure that by law a government would do two economic reports: one at the time of the budget and one at the time of the midyear review. The reason that was legislated was to ensure that in Australia never again would the kind of deceit that was practised by Mr Beazley, the now Leader of the Opposition, occur. He went into the March 1996 election telling the people of Australia that the budget was then in surplus and, after we were elected, within a week we had a report that, far from being in surplus, it was $10,000 million in deficit.This government produces, in accordance with the law and the charter of budget honesty, two economic statements: one at the budget and one at the time of the midyear review. Before I became the Treasurer and before the charter of budget honesty was enacted the Labor Party used to put a two-page press release out and called it a midyear review. It was two pages. Under the charter of budget honesty this government reports on its forecasts, its budget position. It reports on all measures and it costs them. It did that in November. It will be updating its forecasts in accordance with the charter of budget honesty when it brings down its budget in May of this year, in accordance with the legislation which this government has passed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her obvious interest in this matter. The first bank to announce the full pass-on of the interest rate cut this morning was Westpac, which announced that Westpac, Bank of Melbourne and Challenge Bank will deliver in full to 750,000 customers an interest rate cut of $31 a month. National Australia Bank have announced that from next week the full rate cut will be delivered to nearly ½ million customers with home loans. Also, importantly, credit card holders and small business and personal borrowers will also have the interest rate cut delivered in full.St George, with a quarter of a million customers, and the Bank of Adelaide and the Commonwealth Bank also announced that next week they will be delivering the home loan cut in full. The only major lender not to have responded so far is the ANZ Bank. However, Wizard, with its 27,000 customers, is to be applauded for its immediate pass-on to existing customers of the 0.25 per cent cut. And Aussie Home Loans, with 120,000 customers, is going to deliver the interest rate cut in full from next week. The message out of this is that the banks are actually doing a better job of passing the interest rate cuts on to customers than they have done previously. In fact, we went back and had a look at how long it would have taken under the Labor Party for the interest rate cut to be passed on, and under the Labor Party in 1995-96 it took 51 days for the banks to pass on interest rate cuts to consumers. Some of them are starting today, immediately. Most of them are getting it done by next week.I was also asked by the member for Forde what this means for the average borrower. The average $100,000 home loan is $60 a month cheaper today that it was at Christmas. A family in Beenleigh, where I understand the average house price is around $120,000, with a $100,000 mortgage is now paying $270 less a month under the coalition than it did under the Labor Party. That is $3,200 a year of after tax income that is not going to the banks but staying with a family in Beenleigh - $3,200 a year.The Labor Party yesterday was talking about the fate of a family of four with a household income of $28,000 a year. What does $3,200 a year of after tax income mean to that family? At their peak in March of 1990 the average home loan repayments under the Labor Party were $800 a month more than they are today - $800 a month more under the Labor Party than they are under the coalition today.For small business the story is just as compelling. Under the Labor Party in 1996 the small business overdraft rate was 11.25 per cent. Today it is 8.45 per cent, a saving on a $100,000 overdraft of $2,800 a year for the average small business. At its peak in 1990 - the days that the Labor Party tends to forget but that we on this side will not - a mechanics shop at a place like Carinda with a $100,000 overdraft would have been paying $12,000 a year more in interest repayments to the bank under the Labor Party than they do under the coalition. It is a compelling story: under the Labor Party you get higher interest rates; under the coalition you get lower interest rates, delivered in full, a hell of a lot faster.</DOC>

 - As the House knows, the government supports the policy of a floating exchange rate, which was put in place by the previous government and was adopted as bipartisan policy. We always took the view on this side of the House that good economic policy should have support - quite different from the Labor Party, which knew that the tax system in Australia needed to be reformed and wanted it to be reformed, but for sheer political opportunism tried to oppose the government every step of the way. To the Labor Party I say this: if you really think that the wholesale sales tax is better than the goods and services tax, why don't you pledge to reintroduce it?I am asked about the state of the Australian economy in 1995 compared with the state of the Australian economy now. The Australian economy today is in many respects much stronger than it has been for a decade. It is stronger in terms of the number of people that are in work - the unemployment rate today is 6.7 per cent and in 1995 it was 8 to 9 per cent. The budget today is in balance, whereas in 1995 the budget was in deficit for the year - one year only - by $17,000 million. In fact, in 1995 the Labor Party spent all of their revenue, sold off assets, expended the proceeds and then went out and borrowed another $17,000 million. That is what the state of the budget was. The Australian economy is stronger in terms of employment, its budget, its debt position and its current account. On today's figures, the current account deficit fell to a low three per cent of GDP. In the years to come the Australian economy will also be immeasurably stronger because this government has abolished wholesale sales tax, has introduced the goods and services tax, has cut income tax, has halved capital gains tax for individuals, has reduced company taxes and, on 1 July this year, will abolish financial institutions duty - something the Labor Party could never have done and something which will give this economy the great growth opportunities in the future which it deserves.</DOC>

 - I am very conscious of the fact that I cannot revive debate but, certainly I think it is appropriate to welcome the fact that this House this morning, this parliament today, has passed legislation to finally remove tallies from meat industry awards. Under the old tally system workers would receive overtime once they had done a certain quantity of work. That meant that we had a kind of two-speed day in the meat industry - very fast work in the morning to reach the tally and rather slower work in the afternoon to clock up overtime. The tally provisions in the main meat industry award ran to no fewer than 47 pages - that was a 47-page obstacle to efficiency in this industry and higher pay for workers in the industry. Its removal is a great boost for an industry employing nearly 20,000 people and contributing nearly 1½ per cent to Australia's GDP. This is an important part of the award simplification process. Award simplification was a policy of the Keating government, but it is no longer a policy of the nark party opposite. What the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is to put all industrial matters back into awards. This means that the temperature of the water in the tea room, the number of beds on building sites and the quantum of trade union training leave would go back into awards, under members opposite. It can, however, once more be bipartisan policy.I would like to refer to something that the member for Dickson said in October 1996 when she was Leader of the Democrats:Our award system ... is at times too bogged down with unnecessary detail and is difficult to use.I am quoting her. She went on:It often fails to ... encourage the flexibility needed to increase the productivity of crucial, high value, high skilled workers ...I am sure the member for Dickson believed it then and I am sure she believes it now. The member for Dickson would be doing Australia a great favour on this subject if she could persuade her new party to adopt her old principles.Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of delegates to the national conference of the Australian Hotels Association.</DOC>

 - I may well, in 1995, have said that. But I, of course, as always -  -  - I may well have said that. Of course, I will apply the opposition check test and have a look and see exactly what I did say. A lot of things have happened -  - Yes, a lot of things have happened since the middle of 1995 to improve the economic position of mainstream Australia. To start with, there was a change of government in March 1996, and that has been followed, in the time that we have been in government, by a very significant improvement in the living standards of average Australians. The opposition leader asks me a question about the pressure on battlers and the pressure on the living standards of Australians. The reality is that since we have been in office the living standards of battlers have been boosted by two significant developments. The first has been the reduction in mortgage interest rates, and they are worth now compared with March 1996 - let alone a comparison with the 17 per cent attained in 1990 - an improvement of $270 a month for the average home buyer. The other thing that has happened is that, under this government, the real wages of Australian battlers have risen faster than they did under the former government. The Leader of the Opposition asks me a question about the impact of economic policy on the battlers of this country. You boasted that you cut their wages! You and your two predecessors used to come into this parliament and boast about how you had cut their real wages. The last person who can come in here and give me lectures about the economic squeeze on the Australian battler is the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition -  - Quite understandably, the Leader of the Opposition, for a person in his position on a day like this, is naturally asking questions based upon today's national accounts. Those national accounts are, as both the Treasurer and I have said, quite a disappointment, but I would remind the parliament, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition and I would also respectfully and politely say to the Australian public that a setback in one quarter does not destroy the additional strength, the additional growth and the additional progress that the policies of this government have delivered to the Australian people over the last five years. There are reasons why the economy has gone backwards in the last quarter. They are largely transitional reasons. They do not give credence to the argument of the opposition in relation to the goods and services tax. It remains the case that the Leader of the Opposition found it convenient to condemn the tax package on the grounds of overheating the economy last year; he now seeks respectability by saying that the goods and services tax has in fact brought about a contraction in the economy. You cannot have it both ways. If you seek to be opportunistic on something like this, ultimately the public will find you out. You may find it easy pickings today, but as the dust settles and the Australian people take a longer look at what we have done, and they also remember what you did when you were in government and they look at the vast empty space that represents the alternative policy prescription of the Leader of the Opposition, they will begin to have a very different view. It may be easy pickings today, but there will come a time when you have to tell the Australian people what you stand for.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can report to him that our aviation policy is delivering enormous benefits for air travellers in this country. Amazingly, it is now possible to fly between Brisbane and Sydney for $39. For some travellers, it has to be said that that is undoubtedly less than the taxi fare to the airport or less than the hardback book that they would read on the plane. The number of passengers flying on the major east coast air routes has increased by over 30 per cent, which in numerical terms is an extra 250,000 people per month who can afford to visit their friends and family interstate who could never have afforded it before.In relation to aviation safety, something that is always very high in the consciousness of the travelling public in Australia, it has to be said that our air safety record is outstanding. A recent determination by an international observer was that Ansett is the second safest airline in the world and that Qantas is the third. The latest Australian Transport Safety Bureau figures reveal that the number of aviation accidents last year was 27 per cent lower than in 1991 - a particularly potent figure when you think of the increased number of flights and the distance of those flights over the period. The government has dramatically improved CASA's capacity to conduct surveillance of the aviation industry. The authority has now adopted quality management approaches which are standard in the world's best run safety institutions. Indeed, for the first time in many years CASA is now fully meeting its surveillance objectives. It no longer suffers from the institutional timidity that resulted in the Monarch and Seaview crashes under Labor. CASA is not a partner with the industry, nor is it an industry development agency; its only job is to protect aviation safety.To be fair, most people in the aviation industry are serious about safety, and CASA's job with respect to responsible operators is to make sure that they remain focused on safety and to help them become even safer through their promotion and education programs. But in the end CASA is a law enforcement agency, and under the government it is taking tough and decisive action, as we would expect it to, against operators who are not serious about safety. In fact, there has been a gap in CASA's enforcement powers which dates back to the old Department of Civil Aviation days. The penalties jump from counselling to very serious administrative action or prosecution. CASA does need new powers to deal with offences that are on the one hand too serious to be dealt with through counselling but on the other hand are not serious enoughto justify suspension or prosecution. As a result, the authority will be introducing an administrative fines system to address those offences. Starting next month, operators who commit minor infringements will receive administrative fines as a step up from counselling, and operators who commit more serious offences will continue to be dealt with through administrative action or prosecution, with a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment or a fine of around $230,000 maximum. The government is also proposing to introduce a system of enforceable voluntary undertakings to help CASA deal decisively with minor offences or safety deficiencies. I recognise that those measures are not universally popular with the aviation industry, but I state again that our primary objective is to protect air safety in this country.There is an alternative. As I say, you should never listen to what the Labor Party says but look at what it does in government. The alternative approach is the approach it adopted when in government. It ought to be recalled that CASA's predecessor, the Civil Aviation Authority, was in a state of what could only be described as continual reorganisation. In less than seven years there were four chairmen, four chief executives and six heads of safety regulation changes.  The government's aviation policy has created two new airlines and has made air travel affordable for hundreds of thousands of families. Our reforms to CASA have improved air safety regulation and sustained Australia's extraordinary air safety record. There is always more work to do, but I have to say that the contrast with Labor is stark indeed.</DOC>

 - We know the rhetorical flourishes of the member for Hotham, and I thought he was going to come to the dispatch box and claim credit for the record highest budget deficit ever in Australian history. I thought he was going to come to the dispatch box and claim credit for the record highest unemployment rate of 11.3 per cent. I thought he was going to come to the dispatch box and claim credit for the record highest Commonwealth debt of $80 billion in the last five years of the Labor government. I thought he was going to claim credit for the record highest number of people ever put out of work, which was over a million, as I recall, in 1990.This government has presided over a period, since 1996, where the Australian economy has grown in a way which has been unparalleled. This government has presided over a period where inflation has been low in a way we have not seen for 30 years. This government has presided over a period where the interest rates have been lower than when the fathers of these two leaders of the Labor Party were in government. This government has presided over a period where the tax system has been reformed in a way which has never been done before in Australian history. For all of the talk of the Australian Labor Party, let them answer one question. If they are so opposed to GST, why don't they repeal it? - He interjects he is going to roll it back. He just cannot tell us when, by how much, on what, how he is going to pay for it or what he will put income tax up to to pay for it. He cannot tell you one good or one service on which he intends to roll back the GST. This is the laziest policy you have ever seen. Mr Della Bosca had his head taken off because he said that Kim Beazley should give up the roll-back policy. Now Mr Kim Beazley gives up the roll-back policy and poor old Della Bosca is walking around headless for no good reason. Della Bosca should have his head reattached to his neck because Della Bosca said, `Give up the roll-back policy; the roll-back policy is no good.' You took off his head and then you followed his advice. On this side of the House, we would like to see the head reinstated on Della Bosca. We would like to see a bit of an announcement of one good or one service where the GST is going to be changed. We would like to know what the price of chicken wings is going to be after roll-back. Most of all, we would like to know how high income tax rates are going to be to pay for it. That is what Australia wants to know.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for the question and acknowledge the representations she has made on behalf of apple producers, along with quite a number of other members on this side of the House: the member for Forrest and the people around Donnybrook in particular, the member for Pearce, the member for Hume, the member for Murray, the member for Mallee, the member for McEwen, the member for Macquarie, the member for Mitchell, the member for Maranoa and the member for Flinders. Indeed, there has been considerable interest in this issue. I can confirm to the House that Australia's ban on apples coming from New Zealand will remain in place.   - Key scientific issues were raised during the public discussion period into the import risk assessment and clearly these issues must be adequately addressed before any consideration could be given to allowing apples to come into this country. The Director of Quarantine announced yesterday that that process would be open and that key players involved in the process would have an opportunity to present their views and the scientific evidence on the issues that have been raised. He has also given a commitment that, if additional research needs to be done to test some of these scientific matters of concern, this will be done to ensure that we can adequately clarify any outstanding scientific issues. - This afternoon, I will be going to New Zealand. I do not expect I will get a terribly cordial welcome, but I will certainly be making it clear to New Zealand that -  -  - I will be emphasising to New Zealand that Australia maintains a conservative approach to quarantine issues and that we will be adopting a strict level of quarantine protection to ensure that we can maintain our clean and green image, our disease-free status, wherever it exists. On the other hand, I will be assuring them that we will deal with these issues always on the basis of sound scientific evidence. We are not prepared to put Australian industries at risk, but we will deal with these issues fairly and on the basis of appropriate science.Over recent times I have made a number of significant reforms to the import risk assessment process to make sure that it is more transparent and to ensure that key stakeholders and industries have a greater role in the process. That is a significant contrast to what happened when the Labor Party was last in government. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was once the minister responsible for these issues, and in those days -  - there was no public consultation process, no commitment or requirement to publish any of the technical papers and no avenue of appeal. These sorts of reforms have been made and we intend to go quite some distance further. Instead of in-house decisions made without consultation, as occurred under the Labor Party, there will now be full and open opportunity for consultation. The government will certainly be involving key stakeholders in these sorts of issues. I want to assure all of those associated with this process that the key scientific issues that have been raised will be properly addressed. They will be addressed on the basis of science, but there will be no compromise on our clean and green image and our disease-free status for apples or, for that matter, any other proposed imports.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Australian government is very sympathetic to the plight of the farming communities in the European Union and Great Britain with the outbreak of both BSE and foot-and-mouth disease. Australia, as has been announced, is providing veterinary assistance to the UK to help manage the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, and we have offered further assistance.This morning I convened a meeting of representatives of the major meat industry groups in Australia to discuss the opportunities that may exist to increase our exports of both beef and sheepmeat as a result of the plight that has beset the European Union and Great Britain. Present at the meeting were representatives from Meat and Livestock Australia, the Cattle Council, the Sheepmeat Council, NMPA, Livecorp and the Australian Meat Council. The first point that was unanimously supported is that we, as a country, must ensure that BSE and foot-and-mouth disease do not enter Australia and affect our industries in Australia. Of course, the government is absolutely committed to ensuring that. We have already committed to providing AQIS with the required resources to maintain Australia's disease-free status. This morning's meeting also indicated that Australia would easily fill the quotas we already have into the EU for beef, which is 7,000 tonnes, and sheepmeat, which is 18,650 tonnes. We will be making representations to see if we can expand the opportunities in both those sectors for access into the European market that are restricted in that regard. We will continue to lobby, on behalf of those industries, for more access into the European Union.At the same time, we have given an undertaking that we will work with industry in gaining improved market access to some of the third-country markets where EU product has been banned. About 70 countries across the world have banned the importation of beef products from the European Union. Some of those countries have already expressed interest in sourcing product from Australia. We want to ensure the Australian industries take advantage of that. Certainly, as far as some of the trade policies that exist that limit our access to those markets go, we will be working to ensure that we remove those impediments to trade as quickly as possible.The overall issue is focusing new attention on some of the policies in the European Union, particularly the common agricultural policy that I know the Prime Minister referred to in question time earlier this week. An article in today's Australian Financial Review indicates that the benefits would accrue not just to exporting countries by the reform of those policies. The article by Alan Mitchell reads:The main benefits of free trade go to the people who open their markets the most. Who would benefit most from the abolition of the Common Agricultural Policy? The European people, who would suddenly get access to cheaper Australian and North American grown food, of course.We concur with that view. As a government, we will continue to work with industry in not just arguing for better access, and access with fewer impediments, to that market and other markets of the world but also creating an economic environment in Australia in which they can be far more competitive. We have heard today about reforms that have gone through the parliament with regard to workplace relations, particularly in the meat industry in Australia. They are well and truly overdue, as you would well know, Mr Speaker, in making those industries more internationally competitive. We have heard today of a reduction in interest rates. Australian farmers, and particularly beef producers, still bear the scars of the high interest rate regime that was overseen by previous Labor administrations in Australia. Our government has vigorously worked towards reducing those interest rates and keeping them down over the years that we have been in office. We have seen a further reduction in interest rates today, which will significantly strengthen the position of Australian exporters. The good news released last week by ABARE in its forecast is that rural exports will increase by 15 per cent this year, further strengthening the economy and rural and regional Australia. We will be actively working with the beef industry and the sheep meat industry in getting access into those markets. </DOC>

 - My understanding - and I will check it of course - is that those allegations that are being investigated emanated directly from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. In the case of Mal Brough -  - Hang on.  - The allegations do not relate to the conduct of the minister. Matters relating to the minister have previously been dealt with by the Electoral Commission and by the Australian Federal Police. In the case of the Minister for Employment Services, he had not been sworn as a minister. He indicated to me that he did not -  - and in those circumstances, and in the absence of allegations of substance that directly relate to the minister, I see no reason at all to stand her aside. </DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question and recognise the obvious and very great interest he has in matters Indonesian. The government, not surprisingly, deplores the recent outbreak of ethnic violence in central Kalimantan, which has left hundreds of people dead. Up to 45,000 people have been displaced from their homes. The Australian government has, not surprisingly, urged the Indonesian authorities to do all they can to protect the security and the human dignity of all residents of Kalimantan. As the honourable member suggests in his question, it is important that we as a country do what we can when there are crises of this kind in a neighbouring country and friend of Australia's. In this particular case we have decided to send, forthwith, 1,000 tonnes of Australian rice, which will be distributed by the World Food Program, to meet the needs of those people who have been displaced.  Arrangements have been made with the Australian Rice Growers Cooperative urgently to ship this Australian rice to Indonesia. I can inform the member for Farrer, and I might take the opportunity here of mentioning the member for Riverina as well, that this rice will come from their electorates. It is a very good illustration of a point that should more often be made about the Australian aid program, and that is that the tremendous strength of Australia in the area of food exports and food production means that we can assist people all around the world. There are some people who say that we should cut out our aid program. There are some people who say that we should not give rice to Indonesia or that we should not give food aid to any countries in any circumstances. But on this side of the House - and, dare I say it, on the other side of the House but certainly on this side of the House - we think it is the right thing to do. We think it is the right thing to do to give rice from the Riverina to the people of Indonesia at this time of crisis. Those people who say that we should not need to explain not just to the Australian community why they would act in an inhumane way in circumstances like this but to the rice growers of the Riverina why their rice could not be used when need calls for that rice. This 1,000 tonnes of rice that we are sending will provide 2.5 million daily rations, or feed those 45,000 people who have been displaced for around two months. So I think it is a very satisfactory contribution for Australia to make. It is a very important contribution to make. It once more illustrates the great value of our having an aid program which can help alleviate poverty and demonstrate the humanitarian commitment of the people of this country to other peoples in our region.</DOC>

 - When I said that I believed the minister had behaved honestly, what I was referring to - and I will repeat it - was the fact that he complied in full with the requirements of the disclosure of pecuniary interests in this parliament. - The opposition interjects and disputes that. The reality is that he did what he was required to do under the code. It was an action of the former government that removed the requirement for members to make oral declarations during debates. The former government decided to do that because, I understand, it became a bit inconvenient. That is why it decided to do it. In relation to the declaration of pecuniary interests required of ministers by me, which are in substantially the same form as were required of ministers by my two or three or four predecessors, I have checked again and the minister complied in full with those requirements. He made the disclosures. I would remind the parliament again that the minister was not present when the decision was taken by the cabinet. What he was doing when he was piloting the legislation through parliament was enunciating government policy, which he is duty bound to do.  It is the view of the government - and it is most certainly my very strongly held personal view - that state governments of both political persuasions in this country for too long have profited from poker machines. - I think they have profited from poker machines and I feel absolutely no embarrassment in saying that. Poker machines have brought an enormous amount of social destruction in this country. They may have fed the profits of a large number of clubs, but they have brought about a great deal of social misery in the Australian community. There are a large number of people -  - Nobody on any side of politics in this country, particularly at a state level, comes to this poker machine issue with particularly clean hands, with the possible exception, I might say, of one or two of the governments in Western Australia which have been rather slower to embrace poker machines than was the Labor government in New South Wales that started the thing going in 1956 and has been followed, I regret to say, by governments of Liberal persuasion around the country. What the minister was doing was enunciating settled government policy. I simply do not accept that there was a conflict of interest and I do not accept that he has behaved in any way dishonourably.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. One of the best things about the white paper - and there are many good things about it - is that we have set out what we think are the equipment requirements of Australia's armed forces in the next 10 years. Furthermore, we have put the money aside in our calculations to ensure that those commitments are properly funded. It is called the capability plan. It is the first such capability plan that we have had. It marks a new era in proper management and planning for the defence forces. I believe it will give this country a much more secure position as we proceed through this decade.I am asked whether or not there are any proposals that might jeopardise that. There is no doubt that in the policy field there are some proposals which jeopardise the very substantial commitment we have made to the Australian Defence Force. I advise members of the House that the Labor Party has a policy for two new subs. The reason that that jeopardises our plan is that its proposal is for two free submarines. I have no doubt that the secret plan of the Labor Party is to raid the defence budget and upset the priorities which are encompassed in the white paper. But that is not the only area where we find the seeds of colossal mismanagement for which the Leader of the Opposition was infamous when he was defence minister once before. - He is going to strengthen national security. What would be the cost? According to his documents, there would be no cost at all. We had a proposal for an Anzac battalion. What did he say that would cost? He said, `Zero, zero, zero for a total of zero.' That is the free battalion you are going to get. We have the community affected by the Salt Ash Bombing Range here in Canberra today. The parliamentary secretary has been speaking with them. Of course the Labor Party has a solution - a new bombing range. What would be the cost of this solution? We have the benefit of Labor's costing - Labor's initiatives from the 1998 election campaign. This is a free bombing range. We have a free submarine, a free battalion and a free bombing range. They are full of promises of new equipment, all purchased from the same shop, and all for free. On top of that, Labor have a policy for a coastguard. In 1977, this proposal was considered. In 1984, the now Leader of the Opposition looked at it and said, `It is not a good idea. On today's prices it would cost $2 billion.' When you look at his policy, what does he say? He says that a coastguard would have a minimal financial impact on the budget. So we have got a free coastguard now to throw in with our two new free subs. The fact of the matter is -   -  - I do not want our Treasurer to think any of this is for free. The fact is that, if the Labor Party is to have a genuine policy position on defence, they are going to have to put up some of the details to back up their position. You cannot hide, when the questions are being asked, how you are going to pay for these commitments. They launched the campaign in Ryan this week, and the one person who was not there was the Leader of the Opposition. The Labor Party, in the seat of Ryan, have got him so hidden away that they have got Peter Beattie sending out the direct mail, because they know that Kim Beazley as an alternative is not well received either in the Ryan electorate or elsewhere. We have a few months to go between now and the next election, and I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you can run, you can jog, but you cannot hide. There is no rock big enough, there is no tree big enough, that will allow you to escape the implications of the empty and hollow promises that you today make to the Australian public.</DOC>

 - What I said last night -  -  - What I said last night, and I repeat for the benefit of the member for Perth, is that the minister made a proper declaration to me. I had it checked. I was advised by my department that it complied in full with the requirements. I am not aware of any basis to allege that the minister was taking advantage of, or had improper access to, any inside information. If somebody on the other side has a specific allegation of misconduct to make against the minister, I will investigate that allegation as I would in relation to any -  - The requirement of the minister in relation to declarations of interest has been met in full. That is the advice that I have received after having made a proper and thorough investigation. The facts of this matter are apparent from the questions that have been asked by the opposition, the responses I have given and the responses the minister has given. In light of the fact that the minister was not involved in the original decision, in light of the fact that he was, in his public utterances, merely advocating settled government policy - which, as a minister, he is required to do - there is not in my view and in the view of any reasonable person a conflict of interest involved. That was what I was questioned about in the first place. If you or any of your colleagues on the front bench have some particular allegation as distinct from a generalised smear, make the allegation and I will have it investigated. Until then, I stand 100 per cent beside the minister. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The government is effectively addressing the skill needs of Australian industries to provide the underpinning for future jobs growth and economic growth in Australia. For the past 10 months, the government has been working with the National Farmers Federation to look at the skill needs of businesses in rural and regional Australia as part of our National Industry Skills Initiative. Last Friday in Hahndorf, in South Australia, the National Farmers Federation handed to me the report, which I had requested from them, on four rural industries, outlining their skill needs and how these skills can best be delivered. The report identified the changing skill needs in rural Australia, including high-tech imperatives such as the increased use of gene technology, robotics in horticulture and wool production, and photonics, all requiring rural workers to have the most up-to-date skills. The industry skills initiative has the very strong support of the National Farmers Federation, and the president of the federation, Ian Donges, has said that this is another example of the government underlining its commitment to skill development and working cooperatively with industry. However, the National Farmers Federation has raised with the government a key concern of many employers of apprentices in rural Australia, and that is that a number of the states and territories are walking away from the policy of user choice. User choice is a crucial policy introduced by this government under which employers are entitled to choose the private or public training provider who can best provide the training that they want for their apprentice. Employers have clearly indicated to us that they want choice, yet some of the states are not delivering effectively on this choice for employers. The worst offender happens to be, in this case, the Labor government in Victoria, the Bracks government, which has put a cap on the opportunity for private training providers to take on additional apprentices. This is absolutely typical of Labor Party governments. As soon as the Labor Party is elected to office, they are protecting the employment bases of their union mates. They do not care at all about small business, and any small business in Australia that imagines that the Labor Party stands for the promotion of anything but union power should think very carefully again. What we see from Labor Party governments as soon as they are elected is that the doors are thrown open again for the unions to walk through, often uninvited, into the business itself in an effort to promote the interests of a narrow section of the community. Nothing illustrates this more clearly in this area than what has happened to the user choice policy - the right of employers to choose the appropriate trainer for their apprentices. Silent as always, the lazy, serial non-performer who is the Leader of the Opposition says nothing to criticise his Labor colleagues in the states, because they know that they are waiting again to try to promote union power through every policy they have. That was how they destroyed the apprenticeship system when in office, and that is what they would do again. </DOC>

 - For a man who continues to deny responsibility for racking up $85 billion of government debt, that is a remarkable question. -  - I remember the accumulation of mistakes and errors made by the former government, of which the now Leader of the Opposition was a senior member, and at no stage, at no time, did he or his former leader ever go near to acknowledging that they might have some responsibility. I have never heard an apology from him about the `recession we had to have'. I never heard an apology from him or his then leader about that.  The basis of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is wrong. The circumstances which have induced the negative economic growth in the December quarter have been outlined by the Treasurer, and the Treasurer has pointed to a number of factors, including both domestic and overseas ones. If we are to have an intelligent debate, instead of an exercise in negative talking down of the Australian economy - in which the Leader of the Opposition specialises - we have to acknowledge that the reasons for the contraction in the December quarter are both domestic and overseas, and they have been well outlined by the Treasurer and me both yesterday and today.I take the opportunity to make a very important point to those who are interested in intelligent discussion about the state of the Australian economy, as distinct from the pure political rhetoric indulged in by the Leader of the Opposition, and that is that one quarter of negative economic growth does not mean that the Australian economy has hit the wall, it does not mean that the Australian economy is in recession and it certainly does not wipe out five years of growth and strength and progress. It does not alter the fact that the unemployment rate now is at least two per cent lower than it was when we came to office. It does not alter the fact that we now have a historically low rate of inflation. It does not alter the fact that the average home buyer in Australia is $270 a month better off than he or she was in March 1996. It does not alter the fact that last October the unemployment rate in relation to women in the Australian work force reached a record low. It does not alter all of those achievements and all of those things of which this government is entitled to be very proud. Yes, we had a bad quarter. The important thing is to make sure that in our responses to that we inspire and encourage confidence and we do not, as the Leader of the Opposition always does, talk down the Australian economy, to the great detriment of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I am not surprised that a member who chaired a committee of this House which produced the report into the retail sector entitled Fair market or market failure should be interested in the future of small businesses, particularly but not only in the retail sector. Small businesses are at a disadvantage under the trade practices legislation because they lack the economic clout and power to take action in their own name when they are at the butt end of unfair treatment and unfair failure. Because of that, the government proposed an amendment to the Trade Practices Act which would enable the ACCC to undertake representative actions under part IV of the act.This proposal, I am pleased to say, drew the support of all of the premiers of Australia. The Treasurer wrote to the various premiers of Australia and, across the political divide, they wrote back and they said, `Yes, this is a very good idea,' including the Labor Premier of New South Wales and the Labor Premier of Queensland. But, unfortunately, I understand that it is subject to an amendment in the Senate. That amendment has been sponsored by the Australian Labor Party, and it seeks to take out of the reach of this amendment any reference to secondary boycotts. This could be called the union escape clause. As the person who was originally responsible for introducing section 45D into the Trade Practices Act, I want to say on behalf of the government that this attitude being taken by the Labor Party is just another exercise in protecting their union mates. We will persevere with the amendment. We think small firms are entitled to have the economic protection -   - of the ACCC, who can take representative action on their behalf. The big end of town, the large companies, can afford the litigation involved in standing up to union secondary boycotts. Small firms cannot. We want to redress that imbalance - we want to give the small firms the same opportunity as the big firms. The only way you can do that is to allow the ACCC to stand in their place, and the Labor Party is against it. The Labor Party is against it because the unions are against it. It is another reminder to the small business community of Australia and another reminder to the Australian community that Labor is still controlled by the union movement. No amount of political rhetoric will alter that reality. When it comes to a choice between union power and the protection of small business, Labor always will choose union power.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is no. The longer and more reflective answer is that, if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were seriously presenting himself as an intelligent commentator and participant -  -  - No, he is not? Oh, well. Of course he is not. If he were presenting himself as a serious participant in, or commentator on, economic debate in this country, he would understand that under a floating exchange rate, by definition, the value of the currency will vary from time to time. People who opportunistically seize on the level of the currency -  - It does not add anything to intelligent debate for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to opportunistically seize upon a particular level of the Australian dollar, and in his question the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to the current level of the Australian dollar. Under a floating exchange rate regime, in case he does not know, the value of the dollar will vary from time to time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition does his own reputation in the Australian community no service at all - and I am feeling in a charitable mood towards the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I would not want the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to hold himself out as being anything other than a serious participant in the economic debate.You know very well that this country has been well served over the last few years by having a floating exchange rate. In fact, the floating exchange rate that Australia had in 1997 and 1998 was one of the reasons why this country was able to ride out the negative effects of the Asian economic downturn. I would have thought that those who sit opposite would support the maintenance of an exchange rate regime that enables this country's economy to adjust to changing economic circumstances. I do not think it does our country any service or your reputation any service to engage in such an opportunistic piece of political point scoring.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. Can I say to the member for McEwen and all members that a significant number of benefits have accrued to all Australian women as a result of the policies of this government. I mentioned in answer to an earlier question that last October women's unemployment fell to a level of 5.9 per cent - it is currently 6.2 per cent - and that was the lowest rate in decades. A total of 65.7 per cent of working age women - that is, aged between 15 and 64 - were in the labour force in January 2001, one of the highest participation rates on record.The $24 million Return to Work Program assists parents and carers, most of whom are women, returning to the work force after a period of two years or more. To date there have been 2,741 commencements in that program. That particular program was an initiative of the coalition government. Women students, as my colleague the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs will know, make up 58 per cent of students commencing an undergraduate degree at university. The proportion of women in postgraduate studies increased from 43.5 per cent in 1996 to 52.7 per cent in 1999. That represents an expansion of opportunities, particularly for younger woman.In the area of parental choice, the family tax initiatives of the coalition, including the initial part of $1 billion in 1996 and the subsequent benefits under the new tax package, have greatly expanded the choices available to both men and women in relation to the caring arrangements they make for their young children. I am pleased to say that the number of women holding positions on Commonwealth boards and bodies is at a record high of 32.2 per cent. I might observe, though, it is still short of what is a desirable figure. In 2001, 24.5 per cent of Commonwealth parliamentarians are women, an increase from 14 per cent in 1995 and almost double, I might I say, the international average. Credit should be given to all of the political parties of Australia that have greatly expanded the opportunities for women to participate in parliament.I am also particularly pleased to note on this International Women's Day the advances that have been made in child care under this government. The government's strong commitment to child care is demonstrated by the allocation of a record $5.6 billion - I repeat, in case the member for Jagajaga did not hear: an allocation of $5.6 billion over four years, including $900 million in additional funding for a simpler and more generous child-care benefit - a total of more than $4 billion in the last four years and that is over 30 per cent more than in Labor's last four years in office. Significantly, in September the ABS figures which analyse various costs in the Australian community showed that child-care costs for families following the introduction of the new tax system had dropped by 15 per cent since 1 July 2000. In other words, the introduction of the new tax system has reduced dramatically the cost of child care for Australian families. This is of enormous satisfaction and pleasure to most men and women.On a broader level, I am also very pleased to note that the national agreement on firearms, concluded in the early months of this government's term of office, has not only created a safer Australian community, it has created a safer Australia, for Australian women in particular.This government remains strongly committed to policies that expand opportunity and choice for both men and women in the Australian community. But it is important, on this International Women's Day, to in particular mark the contribution of the government's policies to expanding opportunity and choice for Australian women. </DOC>

 - As it happens, I have not seen the front page of the Nillumbik GazetteOpposition members - Mail! - Nor have I seen the front page of the Nillumbik Mail, so obviously I cannot comment on the story. I might say that, if this were a genuine question from the opposition, no doubt the honourable member would have shown it to me - if he really wanted an answer to the question. But the Nillumbik Mail ought to know that he did not, because he was more interested, I take it, in making a political statement on the basis of it. The tax changes put in place on 1 July 2000 abolished wholesale sales tax - which, of course, was a tax on printing - replaced the wholesale sales tax with a goods and services tax on a broader base at a lower rate and they reduced income taxes so that people have more money in their pockets to spend. Let us not forget that the Labor Party opposed the cutting of income taxes and claimed that you could not cut income taxes because it would be too expansionary to fiscal policy. For small business, we then reduced the company tax rate, we introduced capital gains tax rollover so that if they were to retire they could do so while rolling over their assets for retirement, and we cut capital gains tax in half for individuals. When all of those measures are put together, the changes to the Australian taxation system were overwhelmingly positive and were overwhelmingly in favour of economic growth, because they cut the overall tax burden by about $6 billion. That was why the Labor Party said in 2000 that they were against the tax changes. This stuff about how the GST is supposed to have dampened demand is a complete, recent invention. The Labor Party's attack was always that it was too expansionary. The Labor Party got that wrong as they have got the other calls in relation to taxation reform wrong. Those changes, on the whole, have been good, and will be good, for the Australian economy and that will apply to all of those businesses.</DOC>

 - I was very intrigued to see the Labor Party change their tune yesterday. For the last year or so the Labor Party have been claiming that the government's tax cuts were too expansionary. They were claiming last year that, because they were so expansionary - this was the claim from the Leader of the Opposition - they were leading to interest rate rises. That was the Labor Party's claim - that they were leading to interest rate rises. Yesterday, after having done a 180-degree turn, he adopted a completely mutually inconsistent position. Yesterday, of course, the Leader of the Opposition was claiming that the GST had not been overheating the Australian economy but it had been dampening the Australian economy.If the Labor Party genuinely believed that the GST was dampening the economy, you would have expected that, last night, when they were asked what they would do about the Australian economy, they would have pledged to repeal it. If the Labor Party genuinely believed that the goods and services tax were a negative dampener on the Australian economy - assuming they are opposed to a dampener on the economy - you would have thought that last night they would have pledged to repeal it. That has always been the Labor Party's policy. In fact, Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, said this on 23 February 2000: ... people are entitled to know where the Labor Party stands on the GST and the direction in which we're going.We would say: that's for sure, isn't it?... people are entitled to know where the Labor Party stands on the GST and the direction in which we're going.He went on to say:They're also entitled to know exactly what we'd do in the next term of government with a GST ...				...			...			...People are entitled to know it and not be deceived.That is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 23 February 2000. Last night, on the 7.30 Report, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked to name one area where the Labor Party will roll back GST - one good, one service. He was asked it not only once, he was asked it twice: name one good or one service where the Labor Party is going to roll back GST. You should have seen him. He was like a gold fish. He was sitting there going like this. He cannot name one good; he cannot name one service. `The GST is responsible for dampening the economy and now we intend to keep it in full.' - After five years the Labor Party is still to announce an economic policy.  - We would say that the Leader of the Opposition was right when he said that people are entitled to not be deceived, and the whole of Australia waits to find out which good, which service, how much money and, most particularly, how much income taxes are going to be raised under the Labor Party. Make no mistake about this: when the Labor Party talks about rolling back GST, the Labor Party talks about rolling up income tax. The reason they will not name the roll-back is that they do not want Australia to find out how much income taxes are going up under Labor. - Ah! Shh! A moment of epiphany: the statement of a policy. Just so that it gets into the Hansard - we just had a policy uttered by the Leader of the Opposition. He says now, `No rises under Labor.' Where have we heard that kind of language before? 1993? Perhaps you would like to put your no rises into - Government members - L-a-w! - We would love to see no rises in l-a-w. The last time the Labor Party made a promise like that, they put it into l-a-w, they ran off to an election, they abolished the income tax cuts and they increased wholesale sales tax. The Labor Party claimed in February that they would not deceive the Australian people - they cannot name one good or one service. Poor old Mr Della Bosca, headless, wanders the streets of Sydney because he suggested that the Labor Party give up this roll-back. You have Con Sciacca out there taking questions on Brisbane radio about the roll-back of the GST. When he was asked, `Are you going to wind back the GST?' Mr Sciacca answered:We have said that we will try to make it fairer and we will try to make it simple. It is impossible to wind back the GST. I mean, if we did that you'd be crazy.I mean: `If you did that, you'd be crazy.' We have the headless Della Bosca, the headless Sciacca and the Leader of the Opposition who wants to talk about roll-back, but he will not tell the Australian public the truth - and he ought to. </DOC>

 - While the point of order was being made, in the time available, I could only write down three - I could write down Holt, I could write down Blaxland and I could think, in relation to the period when the honourable gentleman was the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, of Canberra and, stretching my mind back, to Adelaide. The circumstances surrounding the resignation of the former defence minister are well known. I think the new defence minister is shaping up very well, particularly on submarines.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her very real interest in these matters. I was talking to the member for McEwen a moment ago and she reminded me to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of a significant number of women in agriculture, from Australian Women in Agriculture, who are here with us in Canberra for a couple of days.Honourable members - Hear, hear! - I had the pleasure of joining them yesterday for the launch of Professor Margaret Alston's book Breaking the Glass Ceiling, which is all about recognising the contribution women can make in agripolitical circles in this country, and progress is being made there but there is still more to make. They and their families will be very much aware of the importance of lower interest rates to the wellbeing of rural and regional Australia and yesterday's reductions will be universally welcomed. They will bolster the new and emerging better prospects for agriculture in Australia. Whilst I do not in any way seek to be trite about some of those industries - and some areas such as the New South Wales and Queensland dairy industries are doing it tough - I think it is fair and only appropriate that we point to the better terms of trade that are now clearly emerging for many of our great agricultural industries. It has taken a long time to happen but we are now clearly looking at a situation where prices are rising faster than costs. In that circumstance, it is important that we never forget - as the member for New England, I think, so succinctly put it - particularly those involved in small business or in agriculture, the damage Labor's interest rate policies did. We should never forget it.  In relation to the farm sector, the commonly used rule of thumb is that every one per cent reduction in interest rates represents a saving of around $300 million to the farm sector in this country. When you think about the reduction in interest rates from the 21 or 22 per cent - indeed, I know of some who were paying as high as 28 per cent from the pastoral houses - 10 or 11 years ago to today's rates of eight, nine, 10 per cent, depending on your margin and so forth, it is obviously huge. It is obviously incredibly important to the rural sector in this country capturing those better terms of trade and really picking up their position.We are now approaching the winter crop sowing period. It is a very expensive time in much of rural and regional Australia. Certainly, I know in my own area, and in Western Australia, a lot of farmers will be throwing everything at it seeking to recover from very tough seasonal circumstances - floods in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, and drought in Western Australia. They will be seeking to maximise their borrowing limits in order to do all they can to recover, and those lower interest rates will be of very great importance to them. I was talking to a farmer the other day and when I was saying that we had done a lot to lower interest rates he said, `You know, I think it has a lot to do with global trends.' It is worth remembering that at the time Labor had our farmers paying up to 21 per cent and 22 per cent interest rates in this country, American farmers - you know, we are engaged in a battle to death with them in a lot of export markets - were paying eight per cent for their money. The situation under a coalition government is that our interest rates have been at or in some cases even below American interest rates. A farmer in my electorate was having a bit of a go at me the other day - occasionally it happens that they have a bit of a go at the coalition - about fertiliser prices and I was saying that there was not a lot that I could do about it. His mate said to me, `I don't know; if you can't do something about this, I might have to vote Labor.' All I had to say was, `Remember what they did to interest rates and remember that a Labor government at the moment would put Simon Crean back in control of interest rates,' and you know what? He backed away at a million miles an hour. </DOC>

 - The fact of the matter is that this government has put more places, more money and better aged care into the whole of Australia, including Brisbane and the whole of Queensland, than the Labor Party ever did in 13 years of government. When we took over, the Auditor-General did an audit and found that the Labor Party had left 10,000 places short because they had made cutbacks. In the last two years I have allocated 22,000 places. Indeed, we have increased funding since coming to office by $1.4 billion in order that we can have more places, better care and more money in the system.  The reality is that we have a ratio, which was set by the former Labor Party government, of 100 places per 1,000 people aged 70 and above. After the last allocation of places, we in fact exceed that in Queensland with well over the hundred, so that as they are brought on stream we have a shorter and shorter period of time, which is called the entry period. Let me explain why it is called an entry period. Where there is an emergency, the average time for entry for an emergency is 48 hours. Where we have used respite, where we have used extra resources to allow people to have services at home, those people are able to make a choice as to which aged care home they may wish to enter. Part of our reform process was to combine what were called nursing homes and hostels and they are now all called aged care homes. Someone who is in low level care can indeed spend high level care years in that same bed. It is called Ageing in Place, and it is a very compassionate program designed to stop people having to be unnecessarily moved and so that they can remain with their husband or wife as a matter of compassion.The question that was asked was a very facile one indeed. It was one designed to cover up for Labor's negligence when they were the government. The reforms we have put in place have resulted in more beds, more money and better aged care.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson. I know she takes a keen interest in small business in her electorate. Yesterday's interest rate cut of 0.25 per cent, coming on top of the 0.5 per cent cut we saw in February, is clear evidence that this government's sound economic policy is delivering low interest rates and low inflation. -  - They have a little laugh on the other side, so let us go back to when they were in power. Let us go back to 1996, when interest rates were 11.25 per cent, compared with the 8.45 per cent they are now. Those opposite  may not be interested, but I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that small business is interested. For a small business with an overdraft or loan of around $100,000, this represents a saving of $2,800 per annum, or about $233 a month. That is in small businesses' pockets. Let us go back a bit further to the 1980s and early 1990s. - I note that the Deputy Prime Minister was talking about higher interest rates for farmers. I was a farmer in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and I remember vividly the devastating effect of 22 per cent interest rates. Let us compare that period with now. If you compare the 20.5 per cent rate that was prevalent in the late 1980s with the 8.45 per cent rate for a business or farm with $100,000 debt, today's rate represents a saving of $12,000 a year - $1,000 a month. This government is benefiting small business. That is in complete contrast with those who sit opposite, because the Labor Party represents high interest rates, high inflation and high taxes. Small businesses know that. They know that the Labor Party is bad for small business.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the member for Hughes for her question. She is a great supporter of the Australian Defence Force. I know she works very hard for it in her electorate. The question asked is a very important question which goes to the heart of the future of the Australian Defence Force. The white paper that was announced before Christmas is the most comprehensive document setting out a plan for the future of our Defence Force - the most comprehensive that we have had in literally decades. In respect of coastal defence, we are proposing the upgrading of Anzac ships; the upgrading and eventual replacements of frigates, making the Collins class submarines fully capable, to fix up the bungling of the former Minister for Defence who is now the Leader of the Opposition; major upgrading of the Orion patrol aircraft - that is very important - and replacement of 15 Fremantle class patrol boats. That gives us a sense of the extent of the upgrade of facilities and capabilities that are contained in the white paper. I was very pleased that when the white paper came out the opposition said that they would support the defence white paper and thus the priorities contained within it. I think that gives the Defence Force and defence industries, and the jobs that will go with them in Adelaide and in other places around the country, real security of jobs in the future. - The Hunter or wherever you wish to mention. For the last two weeks, we have been entitled to and have pursued the question of how the Labor Party will pay for not only the white paper but the additional two submarines which are at the core of the maritime aspects of their policy. We welcome what they say on the white paper. The Leader of the Opposition says:The opposition finds the broad policy framework enunciated in the white paper to be an appropriate basis for defence policy and military strategy in Australia. And the shadow minister - the best form of defence is offence - went so far as to say that the white paper was so good that in fact it was the Labor Party's idea. He said:Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - So he announced prior to Christmas. Labor say they are going to have the white paper and they are going to have two additional submarines. They say they are free submarines, but we all know that subs cost money, a lot of money. It is pretty simple. Back in 1998, the Labor Party were going to pay for their two free subs by reordering priorities so that other projects within Defence would have been cancelled. So the question for today is, and the question for the last two weeks has been: what are you going to do? Are you going to cancel defence projects which you have publicly said you will support or will you in fact find the money elsewhere? After two weeks, we finally have a response from the Labor Party on a fairly simple but significant question. This is a response three paragraphs long, but longer in its impact on the Defence Force. This is in today's West Australian. It says: The federal opposition says that it will cut funding on other defence items to pay for two submarines worth more than $1 billion rather than boost defence spending. Defence minister Reith has challenged opposition leader, Kim Beazley, to say how he intended to pay for what Mr Reith called free subs and other defence promises.A spokesman for Mr Beazley said it was planned to buy the vessels out of the global defence budget. Funding for other items would be cut.We want to know where the Labor Party are going to cut into the priorities which, like the hypocrites they are, they have been telling the Australian public they support. They have been going around the country saying that the defence white paper is so good that it is the Labor Party's policy and that they will enact it. Now, in the dead of night, after a bit of pressure for a couple of weeks, we find that Labor have a plan to trash the capability requirements set out in the white paper. What does that mean? Are they going to trash the upgrading of the Anzac ships? Are they going to trash the 15 replacements for the Fremantles which we need for the coastal defence and surveillance task? Are they going to undermine our capacity for the purchase of new combat aircraft? Are they going to scrap the 350 armed personnel carriers which we are going to upgrade? Lastly, are they going to do what they did back in 1991? Back in 1991, what the Labor Party did was basically to scrap two battalions. The import of this is that Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, is going back to the discredited policy. When we had to deal with Timor, it was only because the government had taken the preparatory steps to prepare for Timor that we were actually able to send the men, women and equipment to Timor that we were able to send. This is not just lazy defence policy; this is a deceitful policy position. The Leader of the Opposition has not bothered to discuss it with his shadow minister, who is out there on a limb on the policy position. After two weeks, this finally removes the charade - this claim about bipartisanship on defence. You have got a policy to trash the very white paper you have been publicly supporting. That is not good enough. We intend to pursue this matter all the way to the next election.</DOC>

 - The area of outworkers, particularly outworkers in the textile industry, is already regulated. It is regulated by a 1982 federal award. Obviously in this area enforcement is difficult. - Enforcement is a matter for both the federal and the state inspectorate in this general area. I can point out to the House that the federal inspectorate is a very vigorous organisation. Over the last 12 months the federal inspectorate has been responsible for launching prosecutions in 5,000 cases -   - which has resulted in the recovery of more than $4 million for workers. If the member for Dickson has any specific instances of exploitation and abuse, I would be grateful if she would report them to the wage line. They will be chased up by the federal inspectorate.On the general subject of women's employment - after all, it is International Women's Day - let me say that this government has a very good record when it comes to women's employment. - Under this government, the participation rate for women has gone up from 52.5 per cent to 54 per cent -  - In the Workplace Relations Act, this government has a regulatory framework in place to cover this matter. The member for Dickson should remember that, because, let us face it, she helped to negotiate it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am in a position to inform honourable members of the situation for 43 out of the 44 health funds in Australia, and it is great news. Of those 43 funds, 41 will have no premium increase whatsoever this year. Of the other two, a small one, the Transport Friendly Society, with about 5,000 members, is having a small increase and the other - GMHBA, based at Geelong - is having a small decrease. So, for the first time ever, there will be a slight overall decrease in premiums for the nine million Australians who have private health insurance.This has come about after a lot of hard work and as a direct result of Lifetime Health Cover, the 30 per cent rebate and this government's commitment to fix an area that was in diabolical trouble. It is great news for honourable members and it is great news for 68 per cent of the voters in the federal seat of Ryan who have private health insurance - one of the highest rates of health insurance anywhere in Australia. The only thing that would put it under pressure would be the election of a Labor government. We are pleased with this result. The one fund that I am not in a position to make an announcement on is HBF in Western Australia. I have asked for more information on that and I will be in a position to make an announcement next week.</DOC>

Labor's record is that from November 1991 to February 1996 average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time adult women increased 3.1 per cent per year. That is okay. Under the coalition, average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time adult women increased by 4.3 per cent a year. Our record is clearly better.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. When the Labor Party was in office, we saw the apprenticeship system emasculated; we saw the apprenticeship system almost destroyed. We had the lowest number of people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force for three decades. In 1994, female participation in apprenticeships and traineeships was a mere 13 per cent. It had been around that level for decades. In the last five years, I am pleased to report that, as a result of the government's reforms to the apprenticeship system, there has been an enormous increase in the proportion of women in apprenticeships, with 32 per cent of new apprentices currently in training being women and the percentage rising. This translates to an extra 66,000 apprenticeship and traineeship positions being created for women in the last five years - 66,000 additional opportunities for women to get high quality training through the government's apprenticeship and traineeship system. This is wonderful news on International Women's Day. I am sure every member of this House will welcome this very significant advance. We have seen also, I am pleased to report, a 22 per cent increase in the number of females doing an apprenticeship in the traditional trade occupations over the last five years, going into industries like engineering and mechanics and becoming electricians. The majority of growth, however, has been in the non-trade areas because the Howard government has opened up to new industries the opportunity to offer apprenticeships and traineeships through the New Apprenticeships system. Industries like retail, trade, hospitality, finance and community services - industries that are large employers of women - now have the opportunity to offer women first-class, structured training that leads on to a portable qualification which is nationally recognised. There is an enormous contrast between what this government has done for apprenticeship opportunities for women and men compared with the previous government. The previous government handed the apprenticeship system over to the trade union movement. They essentially frightened employers out of taking on apprentices and trainees because to take on a trainee was just about equivalent to inviting the ACTU through the door into the small business workplace. We have put in place an apprenticeship system which actually meets the needs of young people, women, men and those seeking to improve their skills. The Labor Party were out of touch. They have no policies now that are going to commit them to reviving the apprenticeship system. We have built up the apprenticeship system. We have built up skills and we have built up opportunities for women on a very large scale. </DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am very keen -  - I am happy to provide the House with the same information I have provided to the Prime Minister -  - so that I can answer this and the imputations, indeed slurs, in the mere question. Millers Inn, the hotel in which I have a one-sixth interest, I have now learnt, and did not know, lodged an application with the Hobbs Bay City Council on 10 April 2000 for a planning permit for five extra machines. - Keep that date in your mind - 10 April 2000. - I have also been advised, but I did not know, that the discussions within cabinet on interactive gambling took place on 3 and 8 May. I was not acting minister until 12 May 2000. I was not privy to any information until the morning of Friday, 19 May when, as acting minister, Minister Alston's adviser briefed me on the cabinet decision regarding interactive gambling. That was the day I announced, in my acting minister's role, the government's moratorium on interactive gambling. - I was not briefed before that date. I had seen no cabinet documents, I had seen no policy documents and I had never discussed the matter with Senator Alston -  - I had never discussed the matter with Senator Alston's public servants or with Senator Alston's staff. I was totally unaware of the cabinet considerations on this matter. The cabinet must have made, I conclude, its decision on 8 May. I got briefed on 19 May to go out and announce the decision and the hotel, again which I did not know, had lodged an application on 10 April. You are a bunch of liars and slurrers. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question and the interest she shows in foreign affairs. I note the interjections from the opposition. It is now 182 days since the opposition spokesman asked me a question about foreign affairs, which demonstrates the depth and profundity of his interest in these issues - not that anyone would call Laurie profound.I will be visiting Washington from 20 to 22 March, and this will be the first contact at ministerial level between our government and the new Bush administration. I will be holding discussions with senior members of the administration's foreign and trade policy team, including Secretary of State Powell and the trade representative, Bob Zoellick, as well as with key members of the Congress.In my discussions with Secretary Powell, I will be underlining the importance of the enduring nature of our security relationship. He clearly knows only too well about that. This year is the 50th anniversary of the ANZUS Treaty entered into by the Menzies government and is one of the great security achievements of Australia during the last 100 years. We will be having extensive discussions about a range of international security issues. We certainly share with the United States concerns over ballistic missile proliferation and weapons of mass destruction, and we understand the interest that the United States has in developing a missile defence system to try to deal with that threat.I note that, in contrast with the opposition here in Australia, a number of countries, including the Labour government in the United Kingdom and the Social Democratic government in Germany, increasingly now share similar views to Australia on the United States missile defence plans. In a joint statement between President Bush and Prime Minister Blair, they said that they recognised the existence of a common threat stemming from the growing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and increasingly sophisticated missiles for their delivery and that they needed to obstruct and deter these new threats with a strategy that encompasses both offensive and defensive systems.That is a very sensible statement, and it stands in stark contradiction to the Australian opposition's position, should it ever become the government of this country, that it would not allow Pine Gap to be used in any way at all if it were to be associated with a development of an American missile defence system - which, of course, in the end would lead to the closure of the Pine Gap facility altogether. Labor's commitment to ban the use of Pine Gap for the missile defence system would in the end lead to the closure of Pine Gap and would severely undermine the very basis of the alliance that we have with the United States. Labor's proposition is apparently that it will fix up the ballistic missile threat through the member for Kingsford-Smith hopping around the world, going and telling the likes of Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong-Il to stop building missile arsenals. You could only question whether they would listen to the member for Kingsford-Smith on issues like that. Of course the answer is that they would not. I also look forward to discussing with Secretary Powell and others perspectives on issues in South-East Asia, in particular, naturally enough, Indonesia, our largest and most important neighbour, and also developments on the Korean Peninsular and in North Asia more broadly. I will be using my talks with Ambassador Zoellick and others to discuss the possibilities of entering into negotiations with the United States on a free trade agreement between our two countries, and the Minister for Trade will, two or so weeks later, be in Washington to enter into further discussions on the topic. We at this stage are merely exploring that issue with the United States and, as far as Australia is concerned, it would be axiomatic, if there were to be such an agreement, that it would facilitate the reduction in protection in the United States against Australian agricultural exports.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. Like the member for Makin, I am very proud to serve in a government which believes in higher pay for Australian workers and which has delivered on that commitment. The latest enterprise bargaining report released today shows record numbers of new enterprise agreements were concluded in the December quarter. What is more, those new agreements have delivered workers pay rises averaging over $30 a week. Under this government, productivity based enterprise bargaining has become entrenched in the Australian work force. There are now nearly 1½ million workers employed under enterprise agreements, and that is up from just 26,000 under enterprise flexibility agreements in 1996. So, under this government, productivity based enterprise bargaining means that workers can earn more without having their money ripped off through higher interest rates, higher mortgage repayments, higher inflation and higher unemployment. Unfortunately, what members opposite want to do is to scrap the enterprise bargaining system that we have put in place and go back to the bad old days of the Accord, which meant lower wages and higher unemployment. I do not believe that the Australian people are worried by a statistical blip in the growth figures. What scares them most of all -  - Despite the best efforts of the nark party opposite, led by the greatest economic ghoul of all time -  - what is worrying the Australian people is the prospect of a return to government of the unions by the unions for the unions under a weak leader who was the teacher's pet of the Hawke cabinet, the court jester of the Keating cabinet -  - and he is now nothing but the ventriloquist's dummy of the ACTU.</DOC>

 - I have seen Labor's banking policy, and I have also seen the level of interest rates today compared with what it was under a Labor government. -  - I might remind those excited ladies and gentlemen opposite that when the Leader of the Opposition last had a serious position in the government of this country the interest rate charged by banks was 17 or 18 per cent. I would say on behalf of the coalition that the best banking policy is a low interest rate policy. Therefore, on the track record of what Labor did when it was in government and what this government has done since it has been in office, there can be no doubt that the best banking policy - namely, a low interest rate policy - is the policy to be delivered by a coalition government. Amongst a number of commitments contained in Labor's banking policy is a commitment to restore all of the services that have disappeared. Is that going to be funded by the government? How many bank branches are you going to reopen under that policy? Are you going to force the banks to subsidise the restoration of those services or are you misleading the Australian people? It is appropriate that the research centre that gave birth to this policy is the Chifley Research Centre, and the name Chifley will forever be associated not with progress in banking but with an attempt to destroy the private banking systems of this country. Let me say yet again that the best banking policy is a low interest rate policy, and on that score Labor has no credibility.</DOC>

 - As the member for Parramatta would be aware, I launched the public education campaign in the Ermington community hall in the electorate of Parramatta yesterday, choosing, as I did, a part of Australia that is very much representative of middle Australia and very much comprises families which, like families all over this country, are concerned about the threat posed by illicit drug use to their children and to the young people of Australia. This campaign, which went to air all over the nation last night, is unashamedly directed towards encouraging Australian parents to become more directly involved in dissuading their children from commencing taking illicit drugs.The research carried out for the campaign showed that more than 70 per cent of young people indicated that their parents and other family members did have the capacity to influence them not to commence drug taking. The campaign is comprised of a series of very direct, unambiguous television advertisements supported by radio and print ads and also supplemented by a booklet which will be distributed to every household in Australia. This booklet contains valuable information in relation to the nature of the drug menace. It contains very useful advice to Australian parents regarding issues to be canvassed in discussions with their children regarding drugs. It contains the street names of the drugs most commonly in use in Australia and contains other easy to be understood information about the threat posed by drugs.Under this government a record amount for a federal government has been allocated to the Tough on Drugs strategy, and I am pleased to say that I have had the cooperation of premiers of Australia across the political divide. Last week in Brisbane I jointly launched a diversion agreement with the Queensland Premier, several months earlier I launched a similar one with the Victorian Premier, late last year I launched one with the New South Wales Premier and my colleague the minister for health has launched and signed diversion agreements with at least one other premier of an Australian state. This is an issue that concerns all Australians. It is an issue that should unite all political leaders in this country irrespective of their political allegiance, and I am very pleased to say that the response, generally speaking, to the government's launch yesterday has been very positive. It is seen as a very direct, no nonsense appeal to Australian parents, and it is based upon the very commonsense reality that the greatest resource we have in fighting the drug menace is Australian families. That is why this campaign is unashamedly and very directly targeted towards enlisting the support of those families. </DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker; I am very happy to answer this question. In regard to media speculation, which the honourable member has of course whipped up to his best political opportunist standards, that will result from a review. I am informed by Telstra that no decisions have been made on any of these matters, including staffing levels, and that, to preserve commercial confidentiality, Telstra does not comment about the substance of the ongoing transactions. The House might be informed, unlike the member for Perth, of the facts of the situation: in November last year NDC reduced its -  - To finish the point, last November NDC reduced its staff base from around 6,300 people to 5,900 nationally. All but 12 of the 400 staff affected were voluntary redundancies and were not forced lay-offs. At the risk of stating the obvious - but it is necessary for the honourable member - while Telstra is partially owned, it is an independent corporation and its board and management are responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation. So I would like to know from the member for Perth whether he would intervene. He never did when in government. I would like to know whether or not he would intervene. He makes a song and dance about decisions that the board has to make in a very competitive environment, which this government fostered. We would like to know whether or not he would intervene. He is bluffing, and he knows it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. The launch yesterday by the Prime Minister is just one part of a very large National Illicit Drug Strategy, the majority of which is in my portfolio because it relates to demand reduction measures. It has many parts, partly reflecting that there is no simple solution here and we have to attack the problem of drugs on many facets. In the health area the largest areas of activity are, as the Prime Minister said, with the states and territories where we have committed $70 million to finalise agreements with Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland for drug diversion programs, programs to take people out of the criminal justice system when they are first-time offenders. This is a very progressive and very innovative program that shows very great promise.Our Non-Government Organisation Treat-ment Grants Program has allocated $57 million to 133 non-government treatment programs for new or existing treatment services. We have funded 87 projects nationally through community based prevention programs. We have spent $7½ million on doing additional research, on providing the evidence about best practice treatment. This sounds remarkable, but in this area there is a dearth of information as to how one can best manage the problems of addiction and it is only now that we are starting to answer some of these questions. Also, we funded the evaluation and monitoring of alternate treatment modalities. We started this in June 1998 and were expecting a report by midyear. One of the outcomes of this may be that we are actually able to fund for the first time in probably 30 years a major new treatment for heroin addiction that has been through a clinical effectiveness and a cost-effectiveness process, and that is the drug buprenorphine. It is unfortunate that people decided to talk about this last week before it has been through the full process, but the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee do advise me they have made a positive recommendation to go to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority, and if we can get it through the final stage of the process we should have a very exciting new treatment for heroin addiction available in Australia on a fully subsidised basis for the first time in 30 years.</DOC>

 - The commitment that I will take to the next election in very large part will be this - that we are committed to the services that they need in rural and regional Australia. Here is the rub. We have clear evidence, an outstanding track record, proving that - in stark contrast to the ALP's posturing. The ALP would have you believe in the first instance, presumably, that when the PMG - remember those days; `back to the future' and then Telecom - was wholly government owned we got great services in the bush. That is the first thing you would have us believe - no effective USO and certainly no customer service guarantee, which are the real tests of commitment to services in the bush, the real deliverers. The next thing that has to be said is that we will be true to our own policy commitment. We clearly have identified the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee as the most effective mechanisms for delivering what rural and regional Australia most needs in telecommunications - standards and the delivery of those standards, and mechanisms for penalties if Telstra fails. That is in contrast to the ALP. When the Leader of the Opposition talks about Telstra operating commercially, does he ever bother to mention who corporatised Telstra? It was the ALP -  - What is the position of the Leader of the Opposition now in relation to the corporatisation, or whatever, of Telstra? It is that he is going to start to direct it again. But it did not work in the old days. It did not give us the services we needed then. So there is no reason it ought to in the future. The only thing it will do is interfere with the effective commercial operation of Telstra, which I am sure the shareholders will really appreciate. So what we will take to the next election is a proven track record of commitment to the things that matter in rural and regional Australia in terms of telecommunications and the evidence that it is real because of the resources we have put into telecommunications. In relation to the question of the sale of Telstra, the government's position is quite clearly known. We have said that it is conditional -   -  - It is - quite clearly known, unlike you. I have not met anybody in the bush who believes you on privatisation. Why should they? Remember the Commonwealth Bank? Remember all those dodges you put out saying, `We will never, ever, without consultation with the Australian people, privatise the Commonwealth Bank'? You are not believed. Neither should you be believed. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. Last week the IMF released a third time a public information notice summarising its assessment of the Australian economy. The government, for the first time, voluntarily released the article IV report on the Australian economy, something that has not been done before. Previously, the information notice has been put out but not the full report. The government made the decision to publish the full report. The IMF praised Australia's economic management, stating:... prudent economic management had created a dynamic, flexible economy that was well-positioned to withstand external shocks.The IMF pointed to the `narrowing of the current account deficit, the limited impact of sharp currency depreciation on balance sheets, and the generally strong financial sector indicators'. The IMF also noted the far-reaching structural reform in Australia, and found particularly impressive the fact that Australia's productivity had increased and increased markedly in the second part of the 1990s. Unlike many countries that did not have an acceleration in the second part of the 1990s, Australia did. Other international measures, particularly from the US Federal Reserve, found that our productivity kick up in the second part of the 1990s was more substantial than in the United States itself. The IMF stated that they supported the mild fiscal stimulus in 2000-2001 - that was the fiscal stimulus arising from income tax cuts - which they saw as a price worth paying for achieving the long-term benefits of comprehensive tax reform. I might say in passing that the fiscal stimulus in itself may well have been a good thing, notwithstanding the long-term benefits of comprehensive tax reform. They also acknowledged the inherent political difficulties with industrial relations reform but noted that the potential pay-off in terms of growth and employment is likely to be significant. One of the two things that the IMF has recognised and welcomed in Australia, and urged more work to be done on, is industrial relations reform. I think everyone on this side of the House would say that industrial relations reform is important. It is something that has the capacity to create more jobs for Australians and we should not let an entrenched trade union movement direct political parties to hold it back. We noticed on the weekend that yet another ACTU president was preselected for the Labor Party frontbench. We have the member for Hotham, former ACTU president, the member for Batman, former ACTU president, and now Jennie George wants to make her entry into this House. The Labor Party would turn the House of Representatives into some kind of old age home for ACTU presidents, if it had its way. The second thing is that the IMF talked about the long-term benefits of comprehensive tax reform. The only thing the Labor Party first promised it would do on tax reform was to repeal it. Then, when it realised that the benefits were such that it could not go through with the policy to repeal it, it has been promising - well, it was promising on an almost daily basis - roll-back. We have not heard any more of roll-back since 17 June of last year. Australia waits breathlessly to see which goods will have the GST taken off them, which services will have the GST taken off them, how much it will cost and how much income taxes will go up as a consequence - and make no mistake: when you hear roll-back on GST, hear roll-up on income taxes. The Leader of the Opposition was on the radio on Monday of this week, and he was asked about his policies and he said, `On the one hand, we are criticised for not having policies.' And here he drew a great deal of strength from not having policies and he said, `If you don't have any policies, the issue of how you can afford them doesn't come up.' The opposition have no policies, no conception of how to fund them and no idea of a coherent economic policy. The people of Australia deserve to know, and more particularly they deserve to know what the cost is going to be.  </DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. In relation to the issue of wholesale sales tax and now the GST exemption for motor vehicles for T&amp;PI pensioners, the original entitlement was extended on the basis of the need for mobility after the Second World War and was a compensation measure in T&amp;PI pensions for loss of mobility. It extends to the veteran an entitlement for a vehicle. It may be for a motor car or a panel van or it may be for a motorbike. - The entitlement has been there since 1948 or 1949. - What I announced last week was that the exemption would apply to a motor vehicle - in other words, a motorbike or a motor car - for T&amp;PI pensioners, and it will apply -  - It will not. It is the entitlement that they have always had, and it will apply from 1 July last year.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I can inform the House that the government has always treated the purchase of non-financial assets as an expense and the sale of non-financial assets as a revenue - non-financial assets being plant, equipment or buildings. That has always been the case under all governments including this one. The treatment of non-financial assets is similar to buying and selling furniture. If you bought furniture, that would be an expense; if you sold furniture, you would save the proceeds as revenue. But a very big change has taken place at the Commonwealth level in the treatment of sales of financial assets. A financial asset is something like equity. Up until 1996, whenever there was a sale of equity - notwithstanding that you were swapping one financial asset for another; in this case equity for cash - the Labor Party treated the sale of financial assets as recurrent revenue. They put it directly on their bottom line.  - When the Labor Party stands, as it does from time to time -  - and asks the government whether it should take Telstra out of its forward estimates, the truth of the matter is that, because the sale of equity in Telstra is the sale of a financial asset, it is not shown on the bottom line in the forward estimates. - The sale of Telstra is not shown on the bottom line of the forward estimates -  - because that way of deceptive accounting that the Labor Party practised was abolished in 1996. - I heard the Leader of the Opposition ask earlier whether the government was attracted to Labor's banking policy. Labor's banking policy, as I recall it, was the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. Again, that is something the Labor Party said it would never do. I remember in the 1990 election the poor officers of the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association running around with placards saying, `Don't vote Liberal; they'll privatise the Commonwealth Bank.' Then Labor got elected and it privatised the Commonwealth Bank.In the first tranche of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank in November 1993, the Labor Party received $1.7 billion for privatising it. That $1.7 billion was treated as revenue - and every last dollar was spent in the 1993-94 budget. In the 1993-94 budget the Labor Party ran a deficit of $17 billion, sold off the Commonwealth Bank's first tranche - and spent every last dollar; they had nothing to show for it. In the 1995-96 budget the Labor Party ran a deficit of $10 billion, put out a Qantas sale, received $1.4 billion - and spent every last dollar, and still went out onto the financial markets to borrow the difference. So they were spending more than they had, flogging off assets, expending the whole of the proceeds and then borrowing to fund their deficits. The following assets were effectively sold for nothing - that is, there was nothing left after they had been sold - the Defence Service Housing Corporation loans area, Australian Airlines, Qantas, Commonwealth Bank 1, CSL, the Moomba to Sydney pipeline system, the Commonwealth uranium stockpile, Aerospace Technologies of Australia and Qantas. The Labor Party sold all of those assets - every single one of them -  - They spent the proceeds in their entirety in the year of sale, counted them to the bottom line and went onto financial markets in order to borrow to fund their deficit. As a result of losing those assets, Australia has nothing to show. As a result of selling all of those assets, notwithstanding the fact that the Labor Party -  - This shows the actual genius of financial accounting under Labor. Notwithstanding selling Australian Airlines, Qantas, ComBank 1, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, the CSL, the uranium stockpile and Qantas, you still ran up $80 billion of debt. You ran a deficit, you sold the assets, you expended every last dollar - and then you went and borrowed $80 billion of Commonwealth debt. This government does not treat Telstra in the way that the Labor Party treats it. We do not put it in our bottom line. This government does not sell off assets and have nothing to show for them. When this government turned the budget into a surplus, all of its privatisation was paying Labor's debt. Today, $50 billion of Labor's $80 billion has been repaid. If this government had not repaid the $50 billion we would be holding $50 billion of debt, servicing $50 billion worth of debt, and the budget would be in a much more precarious position. This government has always adopted the principle of not putting that on the bottom line, of using assets sales to build other assets and retire debt. Shame on the Labor Party for its wanton mismanagement! </DOC>

 - The government has made it perfectly plain that any further sale of Telstra is conditional upon us addressing and discharging our responsibilities in relation to the findings of the Besley inquiry that we set up. Their only response to it was to seek to denigrate three very fine Australians we asked to go out there. They are about as high a quality as possible but, no, they did not like it. - You can dish it out but you cannot take it. We have made it quite plain -  -  - It is true. That is all they did - just denigrate the three fine Australians we asked to report on the state of telecommunications in the bush. They gave us an honest answer about what needed to be done, and we have said that any further sale is conditional upon us addressing those concerns. I would have thought that that was a very strong policy position for anyone who was genuinely interested in service outcomes in rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question, and I note her very real interest in telecommunications in her own electorate. As has already been highlighted in this place today, in the end you have to look at evidence, in the end you have to look at the facts and in the end you have to look at performance and compare it with something. There is no doubt that we have delivered consistent, real and ongoing improvements in telecommunications services right across Australia, but in particular in rural and regional areas. Let us come to the most effective device of all for those who are really interested in service delivery outcomes as opposed to political rhetoric and the scoring of cheap personal points, as the opposition spokesman so busily concentrates his energies on, and that is the customer service guarantee. The first question that has to be asked is: who put the customer service guarantee in place? It was not the ALP. Indeed, unless something has happened that I am unaware of, we do not even know yet from their policy platform whether they support it. Yet it is that very mechanism that has set down standards of service delivery which telephone companies have to meet across Australia - and if they do not meet them there are penalties.I do not know whether anybody remembers the old days of the ALP's fully owned PMG and Telecom, but I remember them. I remember being on a party line; I remember what the service delivery standards were like in those days - all of 14 or 15 years ago when they were still in power. If you wanted a telephone there was absolutely no obligation - none - on Telecom to actually get you one in a decent period of time. There was nothing at all. The evidence is that no-one in the ALP is actually interested in standards - that is really evident to everyone who is listening. We expanded the universal service obligation, too, to beef it up very considerably. Then there is mobile phone coverage. Who was it who, without a thought for rural and regional Australians, just wiped out the old analog network? And under whom was it that an alternative was found? The coalition, with CDMA, which is now replacing the service that Labor gave away. Then there is Networking the Nation. We have now delivered around $250 million in funding for around 500 projects to expand and improve services. The latest round includes, for example, at Mungindi in my own electorate, a new base station and a repeater to give the town and surrounding area -  - Someone has been there - who has been there? -  - No, they would not have been out there - none of them would have been out there. - That will give that town and the surrounding area mobile phone coverage, something they would never have got under the ALP. In South Australia a pilot project will trial the use of high quality Internet access for the School of the Air, connecting remote kids in an advanced virtual classroom. That would never have happened under the ALP. In New South Wales a joint project with the state library, worth around $5 million, will provide broadband access to at least 90 rural communities. Then there is the $150 million local call access arrangements for the 40,000 people who live in remote Australia. Was that an ALP doing; was that something the ALP thought of - the putting out to tender of the provision of services out there? And so it goes on: $25 million to complete mobile phone coverage along nearly 9,500 kilometres of Australia's busiest highways.There is more work to be done - we identified that via the Besley report. The installation, repair and reliability of phone services is still an issue, and mobile phone coverage is an ongoing issue, as is access to the Internet and data speeds generally. These will all be areas of further focus by the government. But, when it comes to alternatives, what do we find? A one-liner from the ALP. And guess what it focuses on? Not on outcomes, but on who owns Telstra. That is all. That is the only policy commitment they have - it is there on Labor's web site. You look up Telstra policy and all you find is a 95-word extract from the Leader of the Opposition's address in reply to last year's budget. All it covers is the question of Telstra's ownership. So there has been nothing since May of last year on Telstra policy and telecommunications policy - nothing. There is nothing about the customer service guarantee or service levels, nothing about ISDN access or Internet speeds, nothing about mobile phone coverage, nothing about improved services for businesses, nothing about distance education and nothing about reduced call costs for remote areas - nothing of substance at all, nothing that matters, for rural and regional Australians.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Barker for his question. I am glad to inform the House that last week the ACCC asked the Reserve Bank to investigate ways of making Australia's credit card system more competitive for consumers and particularly for small business. As of January this year, there were 9.5 million credit card accounts in Australia and there were 64 million card transactions a month. There is also $6.4 billion a month spent on credit cards which, for the average Australian family, represents spending of $15,000 a year on credit cards. Under the current interchange arrangements, about $150 from that credit card expenditure each year goes in interchange fees to the bank. Under the powers given to the Reserve Bank by this government in 1998, the Reserve Bank has the capacity to reopen the interchange system for competition and to break down the cartel that is being run particularly by the international credit card providers. The Labor Party did nothing for 13 years on this. Under the Wallis reforms in 1996, and by their delivery in 1998, we have put in place the mechanism that allows this credit card cartel to be broken open to competition.The member for Barker asked me a question in relation to alternative banking policies, and I must say that I was a bit surprised to see the Labor Party announce their banking policy today. The reason is that the Labor Party have been reported in the media on numerous occasions now saying that they were going to release their banking policy in April. All of a sudden, they release their banking policy today. -  - I am coming to `why'. The reason why it is a little surprising is that the government and the Australian Bankers Association have been discussing a consolidated response from the banking industry to the recommendations in the Viney report. The Australian Bankers Association had discussed it with the government and decided to release it this Wednesday.   - The Australian Bankers Association coordinated all the major banks in order to have four legs to their announcement this coming Wednesday. The first was a basic account for disadvantaged Australians; the second was a branch closure protocol; the third was special services for disabled customers; and the fourth was a response to Viney on the banking code. Today I looked at the Labor Party's policy and it says there will be, firstly, a basic account for the disadvantaged; secondly, a branch closure protocol; thirdly, special services for disabled customers; and, fourthly, a review of the banking code. I think the word for that is `plagiarism'.It gets even better. To give credit to the Labor Party, there is something that is unique, and that is their promise to reregulate banking with a social charter. They refer to the social charter which they are going to negotiate with the four major banks - all the major banks. They state that, if this social charter is not implemented by the banks on a voluntary basis, it will be implemented through law. In case the Labor Party missed it, I have here a copy of Banking Finance, with the headline `CBA resists charter'. The biggest consumer bank in the country has already said that it is resisting Labor's policy: it will not sign up to the Labor Party's policy. If the Labor Party think -  - In the next 24 hours we will be endeavouring to find out as much as we can about the Labor Party's policy, because the indications so far are that they have stolen half of it from the banks themselves. Secondly, they have a voluntary social charter that the biggest bank in the country has already said it will not sign up to. The third key factor is that they say they are going to levy the banks -  - The member for Hotham - God bless his soul - said that we are not going to try. The member for Hotham is out there promoting the reregulation of banking - and do you know what the total cost will be? The Labor Party closed 500 bank branches in their last three years of office. They reckon that they can reopen 500 bank branches with $20 million a year. They are going to levy every bank in Australia, which means levying every bank account in Australia. They are not capping profits. When it comes to the Labor Party's policy on banking, who pays? I will tell you who pays - the people who have their money in bank accounts. They are the people that are going to pay for the Labor Party's sloppy, plagiaristic policy on banking.</DOC>

 - I thought I had fully explained this to the member for Hotham earlier. When the Labor Party was in office, the proceeds of sale were put directly on the bottom line of the budget. For example, in November 1993, the Commonwealth Bank secondary public share offer, which raised $1.7 billion, was put directly on the bottom line of the budget, and you announced an outcome after treating that as revenue. Let me give another example. The Qantas public share offer of July 1995, which was sold for $1.4 billion, you put on the bottom line. When you announced your budget bottom line, you put $1.4 billion in as revenue, notwithstanding that it was a one-off sale of a capital asset. It was not until this government was elected that we said that one-off sale of capital assets, financial assets, are not going on the budget bottom line. They do not go on the budget bottom line. We report an underlying surplus every year in the budget which does not include the proceeds of capital sales in the bottom line. Only in relation to cash flow do we produce a cash flow statement where you can add it back in and it appears as a headline figure. Let me tell you what the budget bottom line would be. The budget bottom line in the 2000-01 budget, which is reported without any asset sales, was $2.8 billion. If we accounted, like the Labor Party, on a headline basis, we would be claiming that we were turning an $8 billion surplus.  - Telstra is not taken onto the bottom line and it has not been since the Labor Party's fraudulent accounts up until 1995 and 1996. Let me go through it further. Not only do we turn a surplus budget without including asset sales, like the Labor Party, but we actually pay down debt out of the budget and, because asset sales are not in the bottom line, the full proceeds of asset sales either go into new assets or go into retiring debt. What the Labor Party did was put asset sales in its bottom line, still turned a deficit and still went out and borrowed the difference. For example, in 1993, the Labor Party, in a period of growth, produced a budget deficit of $17 billion, padded it out with $1.7 billion, which it put in the bottom line, it was about $15 billion short, and it went out onto the financial markets to borrow the difference. You not only produced deficits; you applied asset sales as recurrent revenue, you expended the full proceeds in the year on which you did that and you borrowed the difference. And notwithstanding the sale of all of those assets - Qantas, Commonwealth Bank, Snowy Mountains, CSL, the uranium stockpile and Australian Airlines - you still borrowed $80 billion on financial markets. When the economy was growing at four per cent, you borrowed $80 billion, you ran up deficits, you included in your bottom line assets sales and you expended every last dollar in the year of assets sales. The member for Kingston is smiling because he did it. He knows how it was done. He was working in the then Treasurer's office and he knows how they did it. And then they were still short and they went and buried - borrowed - Australia in $80 billion debt.This government does not report the proceeds of asset sales as revenues, it does not report them as negative outlays, it does not report them in its cash balance, it does not report them in its fiscal balance and, what is more, it uses them to build assets and retire Labor's debt.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I note that none of the bridges of concern are in his electorate, but I can certainly assure the House that the member for Eden-Monaro is a vigorous advocate of the need for infrastructure in his own electorate. There are other members of this place, though, that are very concerned indeed that there are impediments to the successful completion of three very significant and important bridges that were announced three years ago as part of the federal government's Federation Fund commitments. It involved $44 million to build new bridges at Echuca, Robinvale/Euston and Corowa as part of the Federation Fund, which was of course a program designed to celebrate the Centenary of Federation and national unity. These bridges are in fact technically the responsibility of the two state governments, but we, recognising that there was a very great need here, put together a package which would have delivered as an outcome of our centenary very much better transport links. It was agreed that as part of this the states would contribute remaining funds to construct the three bridges. I am very disappointed indeed to have to report that three years on - thanks very much to Victoria and New South Wales - we are not yet in the process of building any of them. Despite the fact that most of those original bridges were built at around the time of Federation - thus making it very appropriate that we now rebuild them - the fact is that the Commonwealth's funding is still sitting on the table.The apathy of the New South Wales state government to the construction of new bridges over the Murray River is a disgrace to the Federation spirit. Not only are they being slow in progressing the planning of the bridges but they have committed no money. It ought to be kept in mind that there has been a joint cabinet meeting of the two state governments down in Albury, and we have committed around $440 million to road projects in and around towns along the Murray River. Some of them go to projects that are not, strictly speaking, Commonwealth responsibilities, but we have been prepared to help those communities to make a real difference to their economic and their social lives, and it is about time that the ALP in both Victoria and New South Wales showed a similar commitment.In particular, the time has come for the New South Wales minister, Mr Scully, to stop palming his problems off to the Commonwealth and accept his responsibilities to Murray River communities, particularly given the quite scandalous overrun that the RTA engaged in when it came to estimating the costs of the Albury bypass. Mr Scully wants to avoid all of that now and sidestep it. He cannot. He has a political and a moral imperative to step up to the mark.The Carr government has just announced a $323 million package to upgrade Windsor Road in Sydney. I am sure that is needed. I know that, when I was out there announcing the Western Sydney orbital, people were pointing to the need for the state government to do something about it. But just one-tenth of that would do something for the people of rural and regional Australia along the Murray River. The fact that that one-tenth is not there, that it is not forthcoming, ought to leave no-one under any misapprehension at all about the apathy that the Australian Labor Party has for rural and regional Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. Last week the opposition announced what it had in store for the Public Service if it were ever to gain office. One has to say that this is quite a remarkable blast from the past, because what it does is take the Public Service right back to the days when policy came out of the office of the Commonwealth Public Sector Union, where uniformity was everything and where flexibility had absolutely no place in determining Public Service working conditions. What the union hates more than anything else is the right of members of the Australian Public Service to negotiate agreements that seek to give them more than the union model. Jumping to its master, the ALP plans to take this right away from members of the Public Service and force them back into the clutches of the union. AWAs, Australian workplace agreements, are to be dispensed with and future employees are to be deprived of the right to make such agreements, even though it has to be said that these agreements have been crucial - quite crucial in some cases - to ensuring that key members of the service remain in the service. Indeed, all the Senior Executive Service are now on AWAs and 15 per cent of the middle management of the Public Service are on AWAs. There are some 5,000 AWAs in the service and the Labor Party intends to get rid of these. It intends to get rid of the right of all members at whatever level of the Australian Public Service to enter into these individual agreements. Moreover, employees are no longer going to be allowed to negotiate directly with the agency to improve their conditions.At present, some 43 of the 100 certified agreements in the Public Service have been negotiated not with the union but directly with employees. Under the Labor Party this is going to be prohibited and the union officers are going to be enthroned once more in every negotiation. It is no wonder that the officers of the CPSU were out there welcoming the policy in the media. Of course, this is what is going to happen with every Labor policy as it comes out and as the relevant union dictates what the terms of that policy will be. Running like a flame on a petrol trail, we are going to see union power zooming through every Labor policy. That is what it is going to be about. It is going to be inflating the power of the unions in every area, and the Public Service is the start. It is very bad news for the Australian Public Service; it is very bad news for the rights of Australian public servants. This is the ugly face of Labor, taking away individual rights and enthroning union power in their place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The Victorian government's 1996 referral of its industrial relations power to the Commonwealth was one of the most significant changes in 100 years of industrial relations history, because it meant that in at least one state of the Commonwealth we had one law, one tribunal and one system. That was very much to the benefit of workers and businesses in Victoria. The Victorian government now wants to celebrate the Centenary of Federation by re-enacting 1901 and by re-creating its own industrial jurisdiction with its own tribunal, commissioners, awards and orders! This will cost Victorian taxpayers $10 million a year. It might create a few jobs for the comrades, but it is potentially going to cost the jobs of up to 40,000 Victorian workers. Perhaps this is a last-ditch attempt to create a retirement home for Jennie George before she comes up here to be the third superannuated ACTU president on the Labor front bench.This government has previously tried to enhance conditions for Victorian workers through its Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 that the ALP has blocked in the Senate. We are now proposing a specific package of measures to improve the conditions of Victorian workers not covered by federal awards: we are going to provide carers leave and bereavement leave; we are going to enable federal inspectors to take action on behalf of workers; we are going to provide extra protection to outworkers in the textile industry. If members opposite were really concerned about the condition of workers, rather than just the power of unions, they would back the government's bill when it comes into the House and the Senate. - </DOC>

 - The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question is yes, I am aware of the comments made by Senator Boswell. Can I interpolate by saying how delighted I was with the decision of the Central Council of the Queensland National Party to endorse Ron Boswell. If ever -  -  - I say again that I am delighted with the decision of the Central Council of the Queensland National Party to endorse Senator Boswell as the person at the top of the National Party ticket in Queensland at the next federal election. I wish him well. Can I say that there is no greater fighter for the interests of country Australians than Ron Boswell. He is a person who fights very hard for the interests of country Australians. The Leader of the Opposition asked me whether my attention had been drawn to the comments made by Senator Boswell about competition policy. It has. It is true that I said yesterday a number of things about competition policy, and I am very happy to repeat them today. They are as follows. This government very strongly supports policies that promote competition in the Australian economy because we believe that greater competition brings great benefits to the Australian community and to individual Australians. I think particularly of the banking competition that was promoted by the findings of the Wallis inquiry, implemented by this government. I think of the cheaper telecommunications charges which have been a consequence of the policies pursued by this government. I think of a number of other policies that have resulted in much greater competition. I also said, and I repeat again today, that in the implementation of any broad policy there may be areas where it does not always operate completely in the national interest. That is what I had in mind when I made those comments yesterday. If I find areas where the policy is not working to the public benefit or in the national interest I will not be the least bit reluctant to pursue changes with the state governments, because that is the commonsense thing to do. But nobody should imagine, and no state government should imagine, that in the process of doing that the government is going to walk away from the implementation of pro-competitive policies. But there can be occasions where a very small nominal gain for consumers can be at the cost of significant dislocation to an individual community. It may well be the judgment of people of commonsense and goodwill on both sides of politics that that does not necessarily represent a net public benefit. That is the kind of public interest test that I am going to bring to this. I think it is a commonsense approach. I should say that there is no understanding between Senator Boswell, the Deputy Prime Minister and me. A number of discussions have taken place between the three of us. Those discussions will continue. The reaction of the government will be against the background of maintaining the thrust of our competitive policy but making certain that, where they are not working to the public benefit, then there should be assessment and adjustment where necessary. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - He is not even serious about that question himself, Mr Speaker. He has got a smile all over his face. -  - We have just heard a question from the great plagiarist of Australian policy making. We have now unlocked the secret to Labor Party policy making: you get an industry group to brief you and - bang, bang - you have got a policy. That is exactly what happened. The Leader of the Opposition does not persuade anybody on this side of the House - and I dare say he does not persuade many people in the broader Australian community - with his new-found concern for Australian banking customers. It was a little different when he was in government. In politics it is always a question of, `Don't do as I say; look at what I did when I had the responsibility to influence the affairs of the nation.' When the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Finance in the Keating government, there was nothing wrong with big banking profits. In delivering the Sir Robert Garran oration on 23 November 1994 he even linked business confidence and high banking profitability. He may go out to the Australian public now and say, `For too long ordinary Australians have had to endure all these things as the banks pursued higher profits at the expense of their customers,' but it was different back in 1994. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects and asks about levels. I will remind you of the level of interest rates when you were last in government. You allowed the banks of Australia to charge interest rates -  - When you were in government, the average home buyer was paying 17 or 18 per cent.  - Farmers were paying 22 and 23 per cent on bank bills. The Leader of the Opposition can wave pieces of coloured paper around in the parliament but I say to him, as I said yesterday, that the best banking policy is a low interest rate policy. The side of politics that has delivered low interest rates is the side of politics that I am very pleased to lead. The policies that we have followed have given the consumers of Australia a better deal, with lower interest rates and lower inflation, than they had in 13 years under Labor. Do not listen to what Labor says. Look at what Labor did when it was last in government. When Labor was last in government, interest rates went to record levels; government debt went to record levels. Labor showed no concern for the customers. There was no social charter under the Hawke government or the Keating government. You boasted about how you freed up the banking system, you boasted about how you deregulated the banking system, and now you come in here shedding your crocodile tears, pretending that you worry about the ordinary Australian battler. When you were in government you not only sent his interest rates through the roof but also you boasted about cutting his wages. You now have the temerity to try and pretend that you care about the Australian battler. You are displaying your monumental hypocrisy. Once again, it is not a question of listening to what Labor says in opposition; it is a question of remembering what Labor did and acted upon in government. The Australian people, the Australian banking consumers, remember that only too well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. Last night, I attended the Rural Roads Congress in Mildura, in his electorate, and I was reminded down there not only of the very high esteem in which he is held but also that, as far as I am aware, he is the only civil engineer in this House. As such, he has been a vociferous advocate of the need for better roads in rural and regional communities. He is therefore, of course, a strong supporter not only of his own community in Mildura, who are wanting us to consider a bypass - which I have undertaken to look at seriously - but also of the Roads to Recovery program. Last night at the congress, I was struck by the overwhelming support of local councils from right across Australia for the federal government's grants through the Roads to Recovery program. Many things about the program delighted people at the congress - particularly its flexibility and the way in which the Commonwealth government is interacting directly with local government. There are no intermediaries in the middle; there are no state governments to interfere, to overlay their priorities, to attempt to cost shift and to do all those things that unfortunately sometimes state governments do try to do. We listened to local councils when we were devising the Roads to Recovery program. We are continuing to listen now. Last night I announced that the federal government will speed up Roads to Recovery payments to local councils wanting to get on with projects that involve large up-front costs. Certainly the money has been flowing quite well. Indeed, having announced the program only at the end of November last year, the first money started to flow on the last day of last month - the last day of February. Since then, some councils - in fact, quite a few - have been saying they want to complete several major projects under Roads to Recovery as early as possible. They have asked if it is possible to bring forward Roads to Recovery money to this financial year. The government are receptive to this. We want to help councils that would benefit from accelerated payments of their grants. I am currently looking at mechanisms by which we might be able to do that, possibly as early as next month. We are also looking at ways of speeding up payments of the Roads to Recovery grant to councils that have quite small entitlements and have projects they want to progress, so that perhaps they can put it all together in one hit. These developments again are reflective of us seeking to act on what local government wants to do. It means that valuable road projects, bringing jobs and other economic and social benefits together in a coordinated way, can be completed as soon as possible and in a more cost-effective way.  Of course, these benefits would never have been possible if the ALP was in control of the federal government's roads program. The point was made to me repeatedly last night, by councils that I met and talked to, that, under Labor, as it was put to me, local roads were forgotten roads - right across Australia. Everyone remembers that. In case the Leader of the Opposition forgets, local roads are the roads right across this nation where virtually all of our exports, all of the things we value add, all of the things that create Australian jobs, begin their lives. They are also the roads that people depend upon to take their kids to school, to get to the doctor and to enjoy a normal social life. As such, they are incredibly important both socially and economically. It is not only federal Labor that has a poor record on local road funding. It has to be said that some state governments are almost as bad. Government member - Queensland. - I hear someone saying, `Queensland.' Indeed, that is quite correct. A recent report undertaken by the Bureau of Transport Economics points the finger at both Victoria and Queensland. They provide almost no assistance to local government for their local road network. One of the things we have been calling for is for state governments to demonstrate a commitment to local government of the same order that we have. We have not had that message reinforced once by those opposite, those new found champions of the interests of rural Australia. </DOC>

 - In reply to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, there are a number of things that are true about the new tax system. One of the things that is true is that the financial institutions duty - which is a burden on many people: many consumers, many financial institutions, many ordinary Australians - will be completely abolished on 1 July this year. It is also true that, as a result of the other reforms that have been introduced - and, typically, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to focus his question on one particular aspect of taxation reform instead of giving proper credit to the aggregate impact of taxation reform - when you look at the aggregate impact of taxation reform, you will find that the average Australian is better off. The average Australian is better off because of personal income tax reform. The average Australian is better off as a result of the other changes that have been implemented. Importantly, what the opposition have to explain - if they are going to impose, under their charter, additional obligations on the banks and are justifying the imposition of those obligations on the banks - is whether they are going to be able to guarantee that those obligations will not be passed on by the banks to the Australian public. - I invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to have a look at the reaction of the Australian public today to the proposal of the opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is putting forward a proposition that additional obligations should be placed on the banks. Those obligations, if they are costly, will be passed on to banking customers. That is what will result from what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and his party are proposing. We are seeing a latter day conversion by the Australian Labor Party to concern and compassion for the customers of Australian banks. When the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were senior ministers in the Keating government, neither of them gave a damn about the interests of banking customers. You were perfectly prepared to sidle up with the chief executives of every trading bank in Australia. You were perfectly prepared to share their cigars and go around reassuring them just how big banking profits were under a Labor government. You had no interest in banking customers. You presided over astronomically high interest rates, you have stolen a policy from the Australian Bank Association, and you expect the Australian public to believe that you really care about their interests.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question and acknowledge her interest in the state of Queensland and its financial relations. On Friday of this week there will be a meeting of the ministerial council which is part of the intergovernmental agreement on Commonwealth-state financial relations. Back in the old days, these gatherings were called Premiers Conferences and the Commonwealth would put an offer to the states of the amount of money that it would give them in the year ahead. In fact, going back some years, it was put under the door of their hotel rooms, late the night before the conference. That has all changed. The Commonwealth has now provided the states with a growth tax, which is called goods and services tax. All goods and services tax is paid to state governments. All of the revenue from goods and services tax ends up in the state capital cities of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth. The Commonwealth collects goods and services tax, it collects it on behalf of the states, it puts it into a pool and it asks an independent grants commission to allocate it according to a formula of need. If New South Wales and Victoria believe that they are not getting a fair allocation, they should convince Queensland and South Australia to change the formula. From the Commonwealth's point of view, we will follow the formula and the outcome of the independent umpire, the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The one thing the states can be assured of is that, notwithstanding the way in which it is distributed - and it will be distributed by the Commonwealth in accordance with that formula - they will be getting the full revenue from goods and services tax. In the first year, 2000-01, New South Wales is estimated to receive $8.23 billion in GST revenues. I pulled out the ABS government financial estimates - and I believe they include specific purpose payments, some of which would come from the Commonwealth - and, just to put that in perspective, the whole spending in New South Wales on education in 2000-01 will be $7.4 billion and the amount of GST paid to New South Wales will be $8.2 billion. The GST will pay the salary of every schoolteacher in every classroom, in every school of New South Wales in the forthcoming year. It will pay for all of the curriculum, it will pay for all of the training and it will pay for recurrent costs in relation to the classrooms. When I heard Premier Carr announcing his roads funding on the weekend - the New South Wales government spends $2.4 billion on transport - I thought, `And there's the GST in action again, building roads for New South Wales.' The state of Victoria, in the current financial year, will receive in GST $5.7 billion. The state of Victoria spends on public order and safety $1.7 billion. In other words, GST pays the salary of every policeman on every beat in the state of Victoria. It pays for the courts; it pays for law and order. These state premiers who run around as if the GST had nothing to do with them - know nothing, see nothing - busily banking the cheque -   - as we speak on a monthly basis -  - paying for the schools and paying -  - It is paying for the schools and paying for the police -  - It is paying for the schools and paying for the police and paying for the social services of all of those state governments. No wonder Premier Bracks has been so critical of the roll-back policy! He was asked on 13 March:If Kim Beazley gets in you'll have to negotiate the whole GST, won't you, Mr Bracks?Well, if there's roll-back we'll have to, that's correct.Because roll-back means this: fewer police on the beat, fewer schoolteachers in the schools, fewer roads. -  - That is what roll-back means. If you are going to roll back the revenues, it means less for the states - and Premier Bracks said this. -  - Premier Bracks said this.If Kim Beazley gets in you'll have to negotiate the whole GST, won't you ...Well, if there's roll-back we'll have to ...So not only do we await the roll-back policy; we await the increases in income taxes and we now await the new Commonwealth-state financial agreement. I thought I should give the last mention to the member for Indi, who sent me a clipping today out of one of the Albury newspapers I believe. It was headed, `Miles of smiles as the treasurer delivers'. I thought this could be a good headline for me, and I read it as follows:The cost of buying a new home has been made a little less painful for an Albury couple. As first home buyers [they] were entitled to a $7000 grant for the purchase of a pre-existing home at East Albury ... A cheque for $7000 was handed to them by the NSW Treasurer, Mr Michael Egan.So this is the Labor Party which are so opposed to the GST that they run around with the proceeds handing out first home buyers grants of $7,000. Down in the state of Tasmania, Dr David Crean runs around with these cheques saying, `The GST, which we are so opposed to, has funded a grant. Why don't you thank the Tasmanian government for introducing it?' I table that document, which shows how GST is paying to help young couples into homes and how the Labor Party are trying to take the credit. This is the tax reform that was important for Australia, and only the coalition government had the courage to do it.</DOC>

 - There has been no roll-back of the GST on motorcycles - none whatsoever. What has occurred, as the minister pointed out yesterday, was the payment, through the Department of Veterans' Affairs, of a subsidy of the order of $100,000 which will ensure the longstanding practice whereby an indirect tax burden does not fall on vehicles, be they cycles or cars, of disabled veterans. We are talking here about a figure of $100,000, which will ensure that the treatment that has been afforded to veterans in this area on a consistent basis will continue. It is not being done by means of a roll-back to the GST. While I am on the subject of roll-back -   - let me again -  - The theme in earlier answers by me and the Treasurer, I remind the parliament again, is that the financial institutions duty, which is slated for abolition on 1 July - and that will represent a saving of $1.2 billion -  - I was asked about roll-back, and I purposely mentioned financial institutions duty. I think under a policy of roll-back the abolition of the financial institutions duty would be at risk. That is the point I make. I have been handed a transcript of an exchange between a Mr Murphy - and I assume that is the Mr Murphy the Leader of the Opposition keeps referring to with affection and approval when it comes to matters relating to GST - and Senator Conroy in a Senate committee on 12 November 1999. Mr Murphy said: But the customers get the benefit of the abolition of FID, which is worth over $1 billion, so their customers finish up ahead. -  - They do not like this. - I will explain the relevance, Mr Speaker. - The relevance is that roll-back is when you take the GST off something, and in order to pay for it you either have to cut spending, increase income tax, go into deficit or increase the rate of GST on the things that remain subject to the GST. That is the point that has been made by the Treasurer. The point I was merely making is that, if you have roll-back, all the benefits of the new tax system are under a cloud and under a threat, and I think that is very bad for the veterans, I think it is very bad for Australian women and I think it is very bad for banking customers - in fact, it is bad for all Australians. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Through the government's defence white paper, which was issued in December, the government has provided the most detailed and specific plan for defence that we have had in 25 years or more. It lays out the most specific long-term funding commitment given by any Australian government for decades. It provides the Australian Defence Force with a plan, it sets out the equipment which the Defence Force will need and, most importantly, it sets out the financial commitment of the government to achieve our objectives. This is a truly tremendous plan for the Defence Force. When I was asked by the Prime Minister to take over the Defence portfolio, I was genuinely pleased. The Leader of the Opposition wrote an article in the Australian on 29 December -  - where he basically said, `Reith's got the Defence portfolio; all he's got to do is implement the white paper.' Really easy job - all you have to do is implement the white paper! I was entitled to assume that the Labor Party supported the white paper. - `Correct,' is the interjection. Thank you. I will take that -  - I will take that on the piece of paper in Hansard -  - That is what the opposition said. I was, however, entitled to ask how they were going to pay for all the other policy commitments that they had made in Defence. When you read their policy, they were committed to a couple of new submarines, with no money to be paid for them - the two free subs. There was a bombing range - a free bombing range - and a free ANZAC battalion. So we started to ask the question: how is the Labor Party going to pay for this? We were entitled to, because there was no greater financial bungler in Defence than the man who is today the Leader of the Opposition - the man who left us with a debt of $10.3 billion when he was the finance minister and when he was the minister for employment gave us 11.2 per cent unemployment. So, naturally enough, we are pretty interested in how the Leader of the Opposition might treat the Defence Force if ever he gets his hands back on the Defence portfolio from the Lodge.So we started to ask some questions. On 9 March, we were told that Labor's defence policy would not be decided until after the May budget. They have a policy, you ask them some questions and on 9 March they say that you will not hear it until after the budget. So we asked a few more questions the next day. As reported in the West Australian, a spokesman for Mr Beazley said:... although it will reveal how much money a Labor Government would allocate to defence in general, it will not tell voters what it will be spent on until after the election.First it was: `We have no policy until the budget.' Then it was: `We have no policy until just before the election, but we won't tell you how we are going to spend the money until after the election.' Then, three days later, there was a new revelation of Labor's policy. The shadow minister put out a statement which said that all Labor's previous policies are `null and void'. Then he went on to say, `It wouldn't be appropriate for us to tell you before the election what we are going to do to Defence if we get in.' Just to add insult to injury, this is after the opposition has lectured the government about our consulting with the public about our defence policy. There is a final gem. He says, `We couldn't tell you what we are going to do because, before we decide what we are going to, we have to ask the Defence chiefs what we should do to manage Australia's defence.' But the fact is that we asked the Defence chiefs how we should run Australia's defence. We took their professional advice and put it into the white paper, and these people in one breath were saying that they support the white paper and now we find that, within two weeks of parliament being back for this year, all their policies are `null and void, and we'll tell you after the election'. This is not good enough. We have the best white paper that we have had in this country for decades. The Labor Party have a national obligation, in my opinion, to support this white paper and to give support and certainty to Defence as to the funds that will be provided for defence in the future and, on top of that, to give certainty to the defence industry, which is going to provide the equipment we need and thus jobs in the Australian community. This is a very serious matter. It is incredible that a man who was defence minister for years and ought to know about defence has the gall and the arrogance to say to the Australian public, `We'll tell you what our defence policy is after the next election.' It is not good enough. It is time that you actually produced a detailed policy. If you were fair dinkum and genuinely interested in defence, we would see some substantive comment from you on the issue instead of your playing politics with Australia's future defence needs.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to respond to the shadow minister and advise him that the government will be implementing the white paper it released before Christmas and, furthermore, will be funding the commitments it has made. In respect of expenditure restraint and obligations on Defence to continue to ensure that they spend money wisely - and I share the comment about that matter which you made today - if you read the white paper, you will see that there is a requirement on Defence to continue the efficiencies that they can find. -  - I am just saying that it is spelled out in the white paper. I conclude with the words that I started with, and they are that we will be implementing the white paper as it was released before Christmas and we will be meeting the financial commitments required to do so - full stop.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Mitchell for his question. Yesterday there were two policies released on banking - one was treated seriously and one was not. The one that was treated seriously -  - The one that was treated seriously in fact came from the banks themselves. I think the government welcomes the initiatives that the banks announced yesterday because, in the first place, they are going to deliver to five million Australians fee-free and low fee bank accounts. We welcome that for the most disadvantaged Australians. Secondly, the banks have indicated that they are going to develop a disability plan with HREOC which is going to provide better and more accessible services to people with disabilities around Australia. Thirdly, they have given a commitment to maintain face-to-face banking services in rural and regional Australia, and we welcome that. Fourthly, the banks have committed to put in place a protocol covering bank branch closures where they will consult with the local community for three months. Some credit for that - in fact, considerable credit for that - should go to the member for Wannon and his committee from the House of Representatives who made that recommendation some months ago, and the banks have reacted to that recommendation.I have been asked as well about the second policy that was released yesterday, which is the Labor Party's policy on banking. A little earlier the Prime Minister suggested, quite rightly, that the most important policy you can have on banking is low interest rates. In the Labor Party's policy of eight pages, if you include the photo of the Leader of the Opposition -  - Seven pages then - that is seven pages of content and one of no content. In the Labor Party's policy on banking there is no mention at all of interest rates. There is probably a good reason for that. I was making some comparisons between interest rates under the Labor Party and those to date. Under the Labor Party, interest rates in March 1996 were 10.5 per cent; today they are 7.25 per cent. Today, interest rates for the average home loan are $270 a month cheaper. Of that $270 a month, $100 was the margin that the banks were charging under the Labor Party. I say again: of the $270 a month more the average Australian was paying for their home loan under the Labor Party in 1996, $100 a month was the banks' margin.There is no reference at all in the Labor Party's banking policy to interest rates. What a surprise! What about interest rates for small business? What about personal home loans and interest rates? If you are looking for a documented hypocrisy, it is the Labor Party's banking policy. The very best evidence of that is in relation to the monitoring of fees. Page 5 of the Labor Party's policy states:Labor will direct the ACCC formally to monitor bank fees and charges.That is interesting. I was having a look through the records and I wondered whether the Labor Party had ever made a pledge on that. In 1983, there was no pledge; in 1984 and 1985, no pledge; in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1999 and 1990, no pledge; and in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995, no pledge. I found a pledge in 1996 on bank fees. Do you know what? They came out four days before the federal election. After 13 years - four days before the Labor Party lost government on 2 March - Ralph Willis pledged that he would write to the chairperson of the ACCC requesting formal monitoring of fees and charges of banks. In a revelation, the Labor Party are going to be tough on those banks; they are going to monitor fees and charges. After 13 years - and I am happy to table this document - the Labor Party did absolutely nothing on bank fees and charges. And they had the hypocrisy to put into their policy released yesterday that, should they be elected, they will monitor fees and charges. The Labor Party banking policy is a document in hypocrisy.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for that question. I will make a couple of points in reply. The first is that in the remarks that I made on radio in, I think, Perth the day after the national accounts figures were released, I did not, as the deputy opposition leader falsely - deliberately, probably - alleges, claim that I blamed the December quarter on the interest rate increases. I did not. What I did say in reply to a question regarding the interest rate rises last year is that I thought that there were errors in relation to them. But I further reply to the deputy leader's question by saying: why don't I listen to the deputy head of the Reserve Bank? I will do that and I suggest that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition listen to the same Dr Stewart Grenville and read his speech in toto. You will find out a number of interesting things. Firstly, you will find out that he claimed, in relation to the December quarter national accounts, that they revealed that effectively 95 percent of the economy continued to grow at close to four per cent. That is what Dr Grenville said. You will find that Dr Stewart Grenville said in that speech - and I invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to have a look at it - that the fundamentals of the Australian economy were extremely strong. If you read the speech, you will find that you should stop talking down the economy. That is another thing that Dr Stewart Grenville said. He said that you should stop talking down the economy. - Now you should stop talking down the economy - both of you. You are the prime doomsayers of Australian politics at the present time. You think that you have a vested political interest in badmouthing the Australian economy but, in the long run, people who badmouth the national interest pay a very heavy political price. You may not be paying any political price at the present time but, in the long run, the damage you are trying to do to the Australian economy will catch up with you. - I am glad that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised Dr Stewart Grenville's speech. I thought that he might have raised it yesterday actually. I brought some notes along for it yesterday and I was a little disappointed. But I invite him to read it. I invite him to find Dr Stewart Grenville -  -  - Dr Stephen Grenville - who is, first of all, ticking him off for talking down the Australian economy and, secondly, confirming the fact that according to their view -  - Whether the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's name is Simon or Stephen, he is still talking down the Australian economy. But I do invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, through you, Mr Speaker, to very carefully read the speech of the deputy head of the Reserve Bank because you will find in it confirmation of the analysis which has been given by the Treasurer and confirmation of the analysis that has been given by me. What he drew attention to was the strong economic fundamentals of this country. He drew attention to the fact that the personal tax cuts overcompensated for the introduction of the GST; he drew attention to the successful interest rate policies of this government; and he drew attention to the fact that we had dramatically reduced national debt. It is very clear from a reading of that speech that he is a person who analysed with admiration the economic performance of this government and it contains, for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - whatever his name may be - a stark reminder of the dangers of talking down your own economy. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. Thanks to this government, for the first time in Australia's industrial relations history workers and managers can exercise a free choice in the workplace. I am pleased to say that there are now 155,000 Australian workers covered by Australian workplace agreements and some 240,000 workers covered by certified agreements to which unions are not party. This government is not against unions but we do not see why unions should control the pay and conditions of the five million Australians who choose not to join them. For the first time, this government has created a system which treats the workers and managers of this country as responsible adults who are capable of making their own decisions and running their own lives. As a result of what we have done, we have more flexible, more productive and more rewarding workplaces. I am proud to say that average weekly earnings under this government have gone up by 12 per cent after going up by just four per cent in the previous 13 years. Under this government, the basic award earnings of low paid workers have increased by nine per cent and, to the shame of members opposite, they actually fell by five per cent in the previous 13 years. I have been asked about alternative views and policies. The Leader of the Opposition is more keen to publish his diet than he is to publish his policies, but some policies are finally seeping out and it is very clear that the Leader of the Opposition will abolish AWAs and non-union agreements, and that means that 40,000 Australian workers will lose the better pay and conditions that they have negotiated. It means that the workplaces of 400,000 Australian workers will be entered by the Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts - they will be going to the filing cabinets, rifling through them, finding the contracts and ripping them up. He will be abolishing the Office of the Employment Advocate, who stands between workers and organised thuggery. He wants to treat contactors as employees, which means that tens of thousands of decent Australian tradespeople and professionals will lose their independent status. Worst of all, he wants to exempt the unions from the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. He wants to allow industry-wide strikes, and that means that every workplace in this country can potentially be tied up by a dispute in just one workplace.The people of Australia are entitled to ask: why is this so? It is because the Leader of the Opposition is the puppet of the ACTU, as demonstrated by his attempts to find a retirement home for Jennie George. Until November, Jennie George was a constituent of mine, a resident of Manly, and the only Throsby she knew was the Throsby who occasionally interviewed her on ABC radio. This is the kind of candidate that he wants to foist on Labor voters.  </DOC>

 - The interesting thing about the industry adjustment scheme provided by this government for dairy farmers in Australia is that it took the federal government to provide adjustment assistance because the states that deregulated the industry did nothing. They provided not a cent by way of compensation for quotas as requested by the industry. The states stood idly by after deregulating the industry, and were prepared to provide no assistance whatsoever to support dairy farmers. That is one of the real tragedies of the way in which Labor responds to the concerns of farmers right around Australia. This government responded fully to the industry's request that we facilitate a $1.78 billion restructuring package funded by a levy of 11c a litre on milk.The honourable member suggests that somehow or other the money that has been raised by this Commonwealth levy on milk is not government money, or that it is not government tax. That is a bit like saying that income tax is not government money, either. In a sense that is true: governments have no money of their own - they get it all from the taxpayers. In this particular case, the taxpayers are the consumers of milk and that is government money in the same way as all other taxes received from taxpayers are government money. This government has in fact acted and responded to the industry's request.The other quite erroneous comment that the honourable member has made is that he has parroted the New South Wales Labor agriculture minister with this quite extraordinary claim that the government has somehow or other got a huge tax windfall as a result of this arrangement. Let me first point out that, when the package was originally designed by the industry and the industry approached the government, they asked for a $1.2 billion package, but they wanted it tax free. There is no precedent for these sorts of adjustment packages to be tax free, and so the industry agreed that the scheme should be taxable but it was boosted by a further $500 million to ensure that no farmer would be worse off as a result of these arrangements. However, that does not mean that the federal government has collected $500 million worth of tax. In fact, Mr Amery, Mr Palaszczuk and the Labor ministers who like to peddle this line to cover up for the fact that they have done absolutely nothing themselves, know full well that an independent authority was commissioned to do a study on the taxation impact of this particular levy, and the conclusion of that study was that the revenue implications for the government were neutral. Mr Amery and Mr Palaszczuk know and they can tell the honourable member for Paterson, if he will listen, that the taxation implications of this for the government are neutral. There is no $500 million windfall, but there is $1.78 million worth of benefits for the Australian farmer - benefits that would never have been provided by Labor state governments, who ignored the dairy farmers of Australia even though they acted to deregulate the industry. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I know from experience that he is keenly interested in affairs relating to small businesses in his electorate. The coalition are great supporters of small businesses and we believe that small business is the engine room of Australia's economy. We go out and we listen to what they are saying and we act. But those who sit opposite just pay lip-service to small business. Last night's rejection in the Senate of the amendments to the unfair dismissals bill is clear evidence of that lip-service the Labor Party pay small business. They sit there and claim to want to help small business and yet they took the opportunity last night to make sure that those amendments were rejected. Amendments which Mr Rob Bastian, the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, said would create 50,000 jobs yet the Labor Party opposed it in the Senate. They opposed it even though it would not affect one existing employee. When I travel around Australia, small business say to me that they want something done about the burden of unfair dismissal laws. They want something done to address the issues of unemployment. Those amendments last night would have done that but the Labor Party opposed them. The shadow minister for small business, the member for Hunter, agrees that unfair dismissal is an issue for small business. He said so in this House on 1 March and then went on and described the coalition's pursuit of these amendments as futile - futile to create 50,000 jobs; futile for us to create 50,000 jobs. Opposition members - Where? - Ask small business. We got it from small business because we go out and we listen to small business. The Labor Party are under the thumb of unions on this issue. If we want to see what will happen if the Labor Party get into government, we only have to look at where they are in government already. Look at what is happening in Victoria where they are trying to reregulate industrial relations. Look at what is happening in Western Australia where they are creating special conditions and special rights and privileges for unions. The Labor Party will trample over small business when they go into government. We will have a situation where the Leader of the Opposition will preside over a government that is dominated by unions, where the member for Hotham will be in charge of interest rates and the member for Batman and Jenny Craig will run the cabinet - Opposition members - It is Jennie George! - A Freudian slip - of course, I was referring to Jennie George. Labor are not fair dinkum about small business. If they were, they would have supported the amendments in the Senate last night. They did not and their fake concern about small business is a sham.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I know he would want me to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of members of the National Youth Roundtable. In recent weeks, the Australian Education Union and the New South Wales Teachers Federation, in cahoots with the state Labor governments, have launched a million dollar campaign which is designed to undermine fair funding for schools in Australia. This is a disgraceful, dishonest campaign which is based on falsehoods. It is a campaign which never tells parents that the Howard government's funding support for public schools is the greatest of any federal government ever. In fact, it goes around telling parents that the federal government is cutting funding to public schools, which is a barefaced lie. It never tells parents that each student at a government school is being funded at around $8,000 per head, whereas students at the neediest, non-government schools are being funded at just over $5,000 a head.This is a grubby and outrageous campaign. One of the most disgraceful features of it is that children as young as five have been used by unions as propaganda couriers. Parents do not send their children to schools to be the bearers of political propaganda designed to elect a Beazley government. This political propaganda has been distributed in schools in Queensland and New South Wales in particular -  - with the connivance and encouragement of the Labor governments in those states. This shows that the Labor Party is prepared to politicise any institution and abuse its responsibility to the children of those schools and to the parents for the sake of political propaganda and grubby political motives. The reason why this is happening was revealed very clearly by the President of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, Sue Simpson, when she was asked on ABC radio by the presenter:Do you want the government to stop funding private schools in all shapes and forms?Sue Simpson replied:That is certainly the ideal position of the Teachers Federation.In other words, this is a campaign which is designed to remove fair funding from the parents of the one million children in the non-government school sector. Today we have reports of a statement by the Victorian Labor Party Minister for Education, Mary Delahunty, announcing that she wants the federal government to abandon its funding for non-government schools through its fair and transparent model. `Abandon' was the word she used!It is now completely clear where the Labor Party is going. We know that the Leader of the Opposition wants to cut funding to schools such as the Bethel Community Centre in the electorate of Werriwa - he wants to take $3,000 a pupil away from that community school. He is now under pressure from the Australian Education Union, which wants all funding removed from non-government schools. We find him, day after day, equivocating more and more on where the Labor Party stands. When he was interviewed some weeks ago, he said that they were just going to stay with the SES model, except for the former category 1 schools, but when he was interviewed two days ago, he said that they would be looking at changes to the model to make it fairer. There are no guarantees because it is a fair model. What you are doing is slipping and sliding. We are watching you because you are under pressure.  The Labor Party, as we know, is the union party. Every one of them is a member of the trade union movement and they are under pressure with Jennie George now coming into the retirement home over there for former trade union leaders. They are under pressure and the weak Leader of the Opposition is slipping and sliding away from positions he announced before. We are now seeing what it all means. It means $9 billion to be stripped away from the Catholic parish schools. It means over $5,000 per head being taken away from students and indigenous community schools.This disgraceful union campaign is all about electing a Beazley government, that is all. It is about getting a Beazley government into power because it knows that a Beazley government would be cutting funding to schools and would be abandoning a fair funding model supported by all the Australian churches and by the entire non-government education sector. This would be a tragedy for millions of parents and students in Australia and this is what will happen if the Labor Party were ever to be elected to power.</DOC>

 - We can see from that question, Mr Speaker, why the Labor Party has no education policy and why the education shadow minister was excluded from the knowledge nation committee by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition does not even value his advice. I must say that is one example of judgment that is not too bad. - The fact is that that publication is an official publication by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs. It is an official publication by the department of education -  - The real value of the operating grants from the Commonwealth government to Australia's universities has been maintained, and it has been maintained because we have been prepared to pay for additional places in universities which the Labor Party was never prepared to fund. We have been prepared to pay for places over and above the fully funded Commonwealth places with marginal funding, and the universities have exercised their judgment as to how many of those places there will be. The effect of the additional Commonwealth funding for those places has been to fully maintain the real value of the operating grant funding for Australian universities. More than that, by freeing up the universities to raise funding, what we now have is universities raising revenue at record levels. The universities' revenue this year is some $1 billion higher than when we came to office. It is higher because of the policies that we have introduced. There have never been more students in Australian universities than there are today. The Australian universities have never had more revenue than they have today, and no amount of fantasising by the shadow minister for education is going to change those facts. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The number of premises in the United Kingdom infected with foot-and-mouth disease continues to grow and has reached 628, with no signs of abatement. There have been two cases confirmed in France, five in the Netherlands and one in the Republic of Ireland. All of these are linked with the UK outbreak. Perhaps honourable members may be interested to know, as a demonstration of how infectious this disease is, that the cases in the Netherlands resulted, it is believed, from a shipment of calves from Ireland that were rested briefly in France, and the cases in France are in the area where these animals were rested in transit. It is a highly infectious disease and it is obviously wreaking havoc right through the UK. In fact, the United Kingdom has estimated that this outbreak has already cost £12 billion in the United Kingdom. Its implications for the world are obviously very significant, and it certainly alerts us all to the importance of maintaining our own disease-free status. It is vital that all passengers observe Australia's quarantine laws. We are boosting inspection arrangements. Five new X-ray machines have been installed this week and there are additional dog teams also deployed. This is not just at airports but also at sea ports and in our mail exchanges. Every effort is being taken to ensure that our disease-free status is protected.This is Protect Australian Livestock Week, a week when Australia's governments, state and federal, and our livestock organisations - 24 parties in all - unite to promote the importance of being observant about symptoms of disease in animals in Australia. The slogan is `Look, check, ask a vet'. The campaign aims to increase public awareness about the importance of being observant. Obviously, if we are able to identify any disease symptoms early, our chances of being able to confine the impact of a disease outbreak are very much greater.I would also like to comment briefly on a statement that has been made by a senior United Nations official in East Timor suggesting that - to use his words - foot-and-mouth disease is probably in East Timor. I want to emphasise to the House that we have no evidence at all that foot-and-mouth disease is present in East Timor. The North Australia quarantine strategy in July 2000 undertook a detailed survey and found no evidence of any cases, and Australian vets who have been working in East Timor have also found no evidence of foot-and-mouth disease in that country. Nonetheless, I am disturbed by the comments that have been made by the United Nations, and I have asked the director of quarantine to seek urgent clarification. The official has subsequently acknowledged that he has no evidence of any foot-and-mouth disease in East Timor, but an officer of my department will be travelling to East Timor to ensure that there is no substance to these claims. I want to emphasise that Indonesia has been free of foot-and-mouth disease since 1983, and the world has accepted that both Indonesia and East Timor are free of foot-and-mouth disease. Nonetheless, it is very important for East Timor, for Indonesia and particularly for Australia that that country be kept free of foot-and-mouth disease. We have a high level of quarantine alert for passenger movements from East Timor. We are not prepared to take any risks because of the high status of concerns in relation to the range of pests and weeds that exist in East Timor. At the last budget, additional resources were funded to enable much more extensive inspections, and there is 100 per cent screening of people and cargo coming from East Timor. It is our view that there is no foot-and-mouth disease in East Timor - no evidence has been presented to dispute that view - but we are taking absolutely no risks. The government will maintain and devote whatever resources are necessary to ensure that all practical steps are taken to maintain Australia's disease-free status. It is absolutely essential for the future of our nation.</DOC>

 - One of the major problems that the universities faced in their research area as a result of the Labor government's policies was that very large numbers of students were commencing research degrees and not completing them. In fact, across the system as a whole we have a completion rate of some 55 per cent of students who complete in seven years, and at some universities the completion rate was as low as 12 to 15 per cent. That is an enormous waste of resources. The white paper is designed to increase the number of students actually completing research degrees so that Australia has more postgraduate research students who have actually got their degrees and completed their research, by making sure that they have proper supervision, by making sure that they have excellent research environments and by encouraging first-class supervisors at Australian universities. The consequence of our policy will be a very significant increase in the number of postgraduate research students who actually complete their degrees over and above those that were the case under the Labor Party.This again is an example of how the shadow minister for education has absolutely no idea of the substance of these issues, because you would think he would be interested in the numbers of postgraduate students actually completing. But, for years under the Labor government when the Leader of the Opposition was education minister, he did absolutely nothing about this. In fact, he made statements that there were too many students going into universities, that Australia did not need the number of universities that it actually had and that it was a mistake for people to think that they should aspire to go to universities. This is the lack of understanding that the opposition brings to these issues.The white paper is a complement to the Prime Minister's innovation statement, which is a very significant boost to Australia's capacity to build on the ideas generated by our scientists and to make sure that those ideas come through into jobs. We will not do this unless our postgraduate research students complete their degrees. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The government continue, unlike those opposite, to talk up the benefits of the changes we have made in the Australian economy in strengthening the opportunities for Australia's exporters. We continue to talk up the achievements of Australia's exporters, both nationally and internationally, in terms of what they have done for the Australian economy. We have seen significant growth. Last year, $142 billion worth of goods and services was exported out of Australia, which generated one in five jobs across Australia. For the interest of the member for Corangamite, one in four jobs in regional Australia is dependent on exports, and almost half of Australia's export income is generated in regional Australia.Last week I launched a publication called From Sheep's Back to Cyberspace, which I understand has been circulated to all members and senators. I ask them to use that publication in their local areas to highlight the government's policies and how they have benefited both in a trade sense in market openings and in the tax reform sense in strengthening the Australian economy to be more competitive in the international marketplace. This publication captures the diversification of the export base of rural and regional Australia from traditional rural and mining industries to a wide variety of manufacturing and service exporters, including the way in which cyberspace, in the form of e-commerce, is changing the way regional Australia and regional Australian exporters do business with the rest of Australia and the rest of the world.It is important that we recognise some of those industries across rural and regional Australia. It is not just, as the name indicates, the wool industry which is now on the road back to recovery - where we saw exports grow by over 34 per cent in 2000. That will also be good news for the member for Corangamite, who represents that part of Victoria. There are other examples outlined in the publication that I implore members to use and I will start with Corangamite: a company in Corangamite that exports tree ferns - K. and M. Cole Ferns of Colac; dairy products from Bega Cheese in the electorate of Eden-Monaro; manufactured aircraft in the electorate of Hinkler - Jabiru Aircraft; grains from the electorate of Mallee; beef from the electorates of Capricornia and the Northern Territory; manufacturing products such as Australia's impressive high-speed catamarans from Incat in Tasmania, which I think is in the electorate of the member for Denison; and tourism in the electorate of the member for Kalgoorlie. Of course, one of the significant growth sectors of Australia's export effort, and an all-important one, is education. The publication highlights distance education from the university sector in the electorate of Groom. - And Wollongong. The book highlights the electorate of Groom. Importantly for those 150,000 students, Australia's education exports are now worth $4 billion. What we want to highlight in this publication are the government's policies in terms of opening up markets, the government's policies in terms of reducing interest rates, the government's policies in terms of reducing corporate levels of taxation and the government's policies in tax reform that have removed $3½ billion worth of indirect taxes from exporters and have helped strengthen the hand of Australia's exporters in the international marketplace.Those exporters are asking the question: what is going to be the impact of a Labor government if it implements its policies of roll-back? Which Australian exporting industries will a Beazley-led Labor government have an impact upon in terms of taxation? From which Australian export industry is the Labor Party going to roll back that tax benefit and impose the burden of higher taxation and higher interest rates? It is important to note that our government is talking up the benefits of exports - talking up what it is achieving - while the Labor Party is talking them down. </DOC>

 - I think the Leader of the Opposition has been reading too many Daily Telegraph headlines. Maybe he helped to write some of them - having had a look at this morning's, I would have to imagine that that might be possible. Let me simply say that we are following, so I am told, the normal practice that you have when excise proposals are introduced. In his question, the Leader of the Opposition does not - I think quite deceitfully - distinguish between the legislation that validates an excise proposal and the excise proposal itself. Let me make it very clear, as I did on radio this morning, that there is no way that the 1.5c a litre cut in petrol excise is at risk - no way. Not even the negative attitude of the Labor Party on these matters can put that at risk. I want to make it perfectly clear to the Australian public that petrol excise has been cut by 1.5c a litre and that, of course, will be maintained. I also make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition that the automatic indexation of petrol excise introduced by the Hawke government, of which he was a member in 1983, will disappear with effect from next August, after having 18 years of automatically putting up the tax on petrol. That was a policy decision of the Hawke government, supported by the Leader of the Opposition and there was no more loyal supporter of the prime ministership of Bob Hawke than the Leader of the Opposition. That is also going to disappear.The real truth of what is occurring is that the Australian Labor Party wants to refund $185 million to the breweries of Australia. The Australian Labor Party does not want to give it back to the drinkers; it wants to give it back to the breweries. The Leader of the Opposition knows that excise is not collected directly from customers; excise is collected from the breweries. If the measure relating to beer excise is defeated, the government will have a legal obligation to pay the money back to Carlton &amp; United and Lion Nathan. They will be the beneficiaries. - Exactly. So the new social justice policy of the Australian Labor Party is that you hand $185 million to the breweries of Australia! There are two breweries in Australia: Lion Nathan and Carlton &amp; United. They will love the Leader of the Opposition as a result of this. The Leader of the Opposition has won two great allies today: he has won the allies of the Internet gambling operators and the breweries of Australia. That is a double that I would not like to be associated with.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to say on behalf of the government that, unlike the Labor Party, we are concerned about preventing the spread of gambling in this country. It is the view of this government that there is already too much gambling in Australia. It is unrealistic to expect a roll-back - now isn't that an interesting word, Mr Speaker - of existing facilities but the very least I would have thought all of the major political parties in this country would be willing to do would be to take action to prevent the further spread of opportunities for gambling and opportunities for human and family misery. I welcome very warmly the statement that has already been made by Senator Woodley, a member of the Australian Democrats, that this is the first federal government - this is not a Liberal Senator; this is a member of the Australian Democrats - in this country to have seriously addressed the issue of problem gambling. On behalf of the government, I want to say that this is a very important measure that, if enacted by the parliament, will save many thousands of Australians from further misery as a result of the abusive gambling by in the order of 300,000 Australians. Nothing the Leader of the Opposition says and nothing his spokeswoman, Senator Lundy, has said on this issue can alter the fact that if this measure is passed into law the opportunities for the spread of gambling in Australia will be reduced. Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition and others can say as much as they like about why don't we abolish poker machines but, I mean, what an unrealistic proposition. They talk about impracticality but their shadow minister is saying that she is against this because we will not abolish poker machines. What an absurd proposition. We have a choice at the moment: we can either facilitate the further spread of gambling online or not facilitate the further spread of gambling online. This government stands for preventing further gambling abuse in Australia. I welcome the support that has been given to the government stance by the Labor Premier of New South Wales, the most successful Labor figure in Australia at the present time. He knows a thing or two about community views on this issue, and Bob Carr has aligned himself with the approach taken by the government. But the weak-kneed, negative Labor Party in the federal parliament have decided to align themselves with the Internet gambling industry, as they have aligned themselves with the breweries in relation to the beer excise. I think this measure of the federal government will do something towards slowing the spread of gambling. There is too much gambling in Australia. It does cause misery. It does destroy families. It does harm children. I think all responsible political leaders ought to take a stand to prevent the further spread of gambling.</DOC>

 - I don't think even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition believes that. This hot secret and, may I say, well drafted briefing note that came out of the Treasurer's office provides some very valuable speaking notes. I think they are speaking notes that analyse it extremely well. They make the self-evident statement that if the Senate does not pass these bills then consumers could be denied. There is nothing unexceptional about that. There is nothing inconsistent between that and what I said on radio and the reality is they will not be denied and you know it. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note that, in representing a rural electorate, he has always been very keen to see an efficient waterfront. An efficient waterfront is very important for Australia's exporters. Indeed, there is no doubt that holding back waterfront reform, something that the ALP was very good at, also held back jobs and prosperity right across rural and regional Australia and across the broader economy as well.I have some very interesting news today. It is a red-letter day for the Australian waterfront, because Waterline No. 26, which is being released forthwith, shows that the national average crane rate reached 25½ containers per hour in the December quarter 2000. There you go: handshakes all round. For the benefit of those opposite, let me repeat it: 25½ containers, on average, per hour across Australia. - It is the first time the crane rate has exceeded the government's waterfront reform benchmark target of 25 container movements per hour. - Clearly, the government's objectives have been reached. This brings me to a very important point: it calls for us to contrast that rate with the rate before December 1997, when the government initiated its push for waterfront reform, reform that perhaps predictably was opposed by the ALP and its mates - or its boss, if you like - in the union movement. The crane rate at that time was around 18½ containers per hour, and Australia's productivity and reliability on the waterfront was unquestionably an international laughing-stock. That is what it was. You met people everywhere who said that they did not want to have to put ships into Sydney, in particular, but also into other Australian ports, because of the lack of reliability and the inefficiency on our waterfront.More than that, it is worth making the point that if there is one thing that supporters of the coalition wanted, apart from economic reform, it was industrial relations reform. The thing they always highlighted as being, if you like, at the cutting edge of needed industrial relations reform in this country was the waterfront. That was what they always nominated. The ALP said that it could not be done and the unions said that it could not be done. The lack of pride in the capacity of Australians to work productively by those who said, `No, it is impossible in Australia to get to 25 movements an hour,' beggars description. In reality, that is where we have now got to. The achievements of the Minister for Defence should be recorded in that regard. His belief that Australian workers could be productive has been vindicated. I think, too, it ought to be stated - and this is a very important principle - that it is not as if we are in some way anti-worker. -  - It is a very important point. A better, more productive workplace results in a happier work force. Why doesn't the ALP believe in better work places and a happier work force? In addition to the improvement in the crane rate for the December quarter, there was a further increase in the average ship rate, which is a measure of the productivity per ship while it is worked, from 38 containers per hour in the September quarter 2000 to 39½ containers per hour in the December quarter 2000.On the other issue of port interface costs, I would note that, in real terms, the cost per 20-foot equivalent TEU has continued to decline. Waterfront reforms are a clear illustration of the government's commitment to Australian businesses and to our exporters in particular. While on the one hand we are dealt hands in terms of commodity prices and international growth rates that we have to cope with and we cannot alter, we have committed ourselves to ensuring that our businesses and our exporters face a supportive environment in terms of interest rates, inflation, taxation and productivity, especially on the waterfront. This achievement is made truly remarkable by contrasting it with the totally negative approach of the opposition. All the way through they opposed this reform. Their union mates said it could not be done. They were happy, as I said, to talk down the abilities and the capabilities of Australians working on the waterfront. They were happy to talk down the capacity of Australia to achieve world-class productivity. They are still at it, of course. They want to talk the economy down, they want to talk down the achievements and the outlook for ordinary Australians, but on the waterfront you have the evidence that to do so is to fly in the face of the evidence of what Australians can achieve.</DOC>

 - On this great day for the Australian waterfront, I would like to add my voice to that of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in celebrating a triumph of good policy. This shows what the Australian worker can do when he breaks free of the class war shackles that members opposite wanted them to monger. This shows what the Australian worker can do when, for the first time in a hundred years, he is treated like a responsible adult capable of making his own decisions. It shows what Australian workers can do when they are free of the tyranny of the go-slow, the picket line and the biffo in the car park for anyone who does his own thing.This is a tremendous vindication of Peter Reith, but it is also a tremendous vindication of the Australian worker, who has shown that he can be the world's best when he is given the chance. The members opposite said it could not be done, they said it was an impossible dream, they said workers could not do it, and they have been proven wrong, as the knockers always are when they run Australia down. Some years ago, when Paul Keating was Prime Minister and when Bob Hawke was Prime Minister, the ALP tried waterfront reform. They spent over $100 million and it was stopped dead in its tracks because John Coombs, with a few phone calls to a few union leaders, tied up the entire waterfront. - If the -  - If the Leader of the Opposition were to become Prime Minister, the bad old days would be back.  - The bad old days would be back, because one of the first things that the Leader of the Opposition would do would be to exempt trade unions from the operation of the Trade Practices Act. That is the first thing that he would do and that would mean that the days of the national strike would be back - that a strike in one port would instantly tie up every Australian port. Under Keating, as you will recall, workers went on strike in one port because the billiard table had not been recushioned. Under Beazley, we will have a national strike if the billiard table in one port has not been recushioned, because the Leader of the Opposition wants the MUA to be able to put its fingers once more on the throat of Australia's international trade.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asks me a question about roll-back and it gives me an opportunity to say something to the House about roll-back. Roll-back happens when you take the GST off an item to which it now applies. - That is what roll-back means. So, if you are going to have roll-back, it means that you are going to take the GST off certain items and, if you take that GST off certain items, it means that you collect less revenue. More particularly, it means that you are delivering less revenue to the states. The Leader of the Opposition has already acknowledged that what I have said is true because, when he went and met Beattie, Bracks and Bacon at Burnie, he gave an undertaking to all of them and said, `We will guarantee the states any shortfall under roll-back.' What you are really saying is that roll-back, by taking it off items, involves reducing GST revenue. So, if you take it off items, you have less revenue going to the states; hence the guarantee that you are not going to leave the states worse off. The question then arises, in the famous refrain of Australian politics renowned for several generations: where is the money coming from?The first source, of course, is to have a look at whether you might not increase the rate of the GST on those items that remain subject to the GST after roll-back. That is one way of getting extra money. Of course, it is a very interesting thing that, if the Labor Party were to win the next federal election, you would have compliant state Labor governments in five out of the six mainland states and in Tasmania. It would be a relatively easy thing - a snap of the fingers - for the Prime Minister of a federal Labor government to rustle up the states and say, `Look, we're a little bit short, because we've taken it off all of these items, so we'll have to increase it on the remaining items.' Of course, the Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh no, I'm not going to do that.' All right, if you are not going to do that, we will go on to the next source of revenue. The next source of revenue is that you will increase income tax. But he says, `Oh no, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to increase income tax.' So I suppose the next way that we might finance roll-back is that we could cut government spending. But, hang on, you cannot cut government spending, because the Leader of the Opposition has promised to spend more. The Leader of the Opposition has said, `I'm going to spend more money on education; I'm going to spend more money on health; I'm going to spend more money on innovation.' And then we might say, `Oh well, maybe they will go into a budget deficit.' But, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh no, we will never do that.' He is going to have a bigger surplus - and he nods his head, Mr Speaker. Talk about Tony Blair's `Third Way', I think the Leader of the Opposition has discovered a fourth fiscal way which, so far, has completely evaded all economic analysts in Australia.  The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition has no credibility at all on the subject of roll-back - none whatsoever. If you think for a moment that that is rhetoric, let me remind you that in an interview with Geoff Parry on Radio 4PR on 16 June 1999 the Leader of the Opposition said:Set to one side, we'll be wanting to roll it back, take it off more and more things.There is coming a time when the Leader of the Opposition has to come clean with the Australian public. The Leader of the Opposition has to tell the Australian public where he will roll back the GST. He has to tell the Australian public how he is going to pay it. The more he delays it the more justifiably suspicious the Australian public will become, not only of the intentions of the Leader of the Opposition but also of his political integrity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I notice that the Australian Labor Party are doing whatever they can to try to talk negatively about the Australian economy as a political tactic. It is not a new political tactic. They tried it in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. When the Asian financial crisis was on, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham used to go out on a daily basis and proclaim that Australia would be engulfed by the Asian financial crisis. The member for Hotham was saying in 1998 that the Treasurer has:... fireproofed the economic car by taking out the petrol. We do risk an economic crisis of major proportions.That was the way in which he described it in 1998. Of course, the Labor Party now seeks to talk the Australian economy down and is trying to take political advantage in this another election year. Have a listen to this statement which the Leader of the Opposition made on 14 March 2001:This is an Australian homegrown recession, this one, that is if there is a recession, and I hope there's not ...That is what he said on 14 March 2001. I was very interested to read the Herald Sun today, 28 March 2001, where I saw an independent news commentary in relation to the economy that the Labor Party might be interested in. It said:When groups start to talk the economy down, that can become a self-sustaining thing, and I think the last thing the business community wants, in reality, is for the economy to continue to slow ... It's a silly thing to run around ... talking the economy down.Who do you think might have said that - the ACCI, the BCA? It was Mr Greg Combet, the ACTU secretary. We know that the Labor Party uses the House of Representatives as an old age home for ACTU presidents. We have the member for Hotham, the third-last ACTU president; the member for Batman, the second-last ACTU president; and we are going to have the member for Throsby, the last ACTU president. But I think you could really improve the calibre of your frontbench without going outside the union family, by entering an old age care program for ACTU secretaries, as well, and by giving a place to Mr Greg Combet who said - and I would recommend it to ACTU presidents Batman and Hotham:When groups start to talk the economy down, that can become a self-sustaining thing, and I think the last thing the business community wants, in reality, is for the economy to continue to slow ... Well said, Mr Combet. - </DOC>

 - The member for Chisholm drew my attention to the statement that I made yesterday about the subsidy that is being provided by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in relation to the cost of application to motorcycles for the disabled. I make two observations in reply to the question. The first observation is that tampons are not analogous to the matter dealt with in my reply because the point I made yesterday was a consistency of treatment between categories of vehicles available for disabled veterans. That was the comparison, not a comparison between items that were or were not subject to a form of indirect tax before the introduction of the GST. What I argued for in relation to the motorcycles was that because both motorcycles and motor vehicles for use by the disabled before the introduction of the new tax system were treated in the same way, so it was that they should be treated in the same way afterwards. That is not analogous to the situation that you claim in relation to tampons.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Forde for her question. I know that the member for Forde would have conveyed to the people in her electorate when we last had an interest rate cut that in fact today the average Australian family with a $100,000 home loan is $270 a month better off than they were in the last days of Labor in 1996. I am sure that the member for Forde would have told the people living in Beenleigh that of that $270 a month under Labor that they were paying extra on their home mortgage, $100 was going straight into the pocket of the banks. There was, of course, nothing in the Labor Party's policy about interest rates. There was nothing in their banking policy that addressed one of the most significant issues facing Australian home borrowers and facing Australian small business - there was nothing in their banking policy about interest rates. And there was nothing in their policy about passing on interest rate cuts. Under the Labor Party, it took 51 days for the banks to pass interest rate cuts through to home borrowers. Under the coalition today it takes seven days. There was nothing in the Labor Party's banking policy about that. The Labor Party stated in the front of their policy that they will:... restore banking services from where they have been lost.In the last three years alone of Labor, 500 bank branches were closed across Australia. Even on our most optimistic estimation, it would cost $300 million a year to reopen those 500 bank branches that were closed when Labor was in government. The Labor Party's banking policy solution is to levy the banks $20 million a year to restore banking services right across Australia. The Leader of the Opposition went to a closed bank branch in Kingston and pledged to restore banking services right across Australia for $20 million a year. You cannot treat that credibly. There is a report in today's paper that it cannot be treated credibly: In the first sign of a market backlash, Merrill Lynch warned that Labor's policy would have a seriously negative effect on the banking sector. `We broadly estimate that if Labor is successfully elected, at worst, we could have a potentially negative impact on bank valuations of 14 per cent.'That is $14 billion. So for the 6 million Australian shareholders who own bank shares through their superannuation and the over 55s, in particular, who own banking shares, point to Kim Beazley when you talk about the cost of reregulation.If the Labor Party is not talking about bank branches and if they are talking about services, let us compare the Labor Party in government with the coalition. Under the Labor Party there were 107,000 EFTPOS points; under the coalition there are 320,000 EFTPOS points. Under the Labor Party there were 7,200 automatic teller machines; under the coalition there are over 10,800 automatic teller machines. When they talk about giroPost and Australia Post, under the Labor Party there were 2,500 giroPost and Australia Post access points; under the coalition there are 2,800. Under the Labor Party, consumers had access to 130,000 points; under the coalition there are nearly 350,000 points. The Labor Party's banking policy lacks credibility and so too does the corporate governance policy that they released today. The entire principles of the Labor Party's corporate governance policy are based on mandatory voting for funds managers and better disclosure of executive remuneration. That is their entire commitment to good corporate governance in Australia.I ask the people of Australia to judge the Labor Party not on what they say but on what they did. The people of Australia will not forget that when the Labor Party was on corporate governance watch, Alan Bond took hundreds of millions of dollars from the shareholders of Bond Corporation; when the Labor Party was on corporate governance watch, Abe Goldberg took hundreds of millions of dollars from the shareholders of Linter group; when the Labor Party was on corporate governance watch, Laurie Connell took hundreds of millions of dollars from the people of Western Australia; and, when the Labor Party was on corporate governance watch, Brian Yuill took hundreds of millions of dollars from the shareholders of Spedley. The only person who would be welcoming the Labor Party's sloppy approach to corporate governance is a guy living in Majorca who is bending over backwards, laughing at the Labor Party when they talk about good corporate governance. </DOC>

 - I thank the Labor Party for its warm welcome. I would be happy to answer any questions if the Labor Party would like to address any to me in my area of responsibility. In the lead-up to the 1996 election, the government announced that it would be setting up an inquiry into the financial system. As I recall, at the time the then Treasurer, Mr Willis, said that the Labor Party would do the same thing if it were re-elected. Unfortunately for him, however, Prime Minister Keating said that he knew of no such policy and reprimanded Mr Willis within 24 hours of the making of that promise. The government went on and commissioned Mr Wallis to produce that report. The reforms of the Wallis inquiry into the financial system were accepted by the government and introduced in full in respect of the setting up of a new prudential regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, in relation to extending the consumer protection operations of the then ASC so that it became the Australian Securities Investment Commission. With regard to allowing new competition into the banking system, members of this House may not know that before the government reformed financial regulation, building societies and credit unions could not get access to the payment system because the Australian Labor Party would not allow them to compete fully with banks. Those changes have been recommended by the IMF as a pattern for other countries.  In its response to the Wallis inquiry, the government also announced that it would not be allowing any of the four major domestic commercial banks to merge or amalgamate with each other. That was an announcement of this government. Prior to that, there had been a policy of not allowing superannuation funds to merge with banks. This government changed that policy. It allowed, for example, the development of Colonial and other bank assurance companies. We announced that in our response to the Wallis inquiry and it is the government's position. I noticed the Labor Party the other day coming out and adopting that policy - a policy which it did not invent, a policy which it had not put in place when it was in government, a policy which this government announced and put in place and a policy which the Australian Labor Party has now copied.We welcome the fact that it has copied that policy. We would recommend that it copy many other of our policies. We welcome the fact that it now appears to be copying our policy on GST. We welcome the fact that it now appears to be copying our policy in relation to the abolition of financial institutions duty and bank account debits tax. I suppose on this side of the House, the best accolade for our policies is the extent to which the Australian Labor Party will copy them and adopt them. For the sake of Australia, I think that would probably be an advisable thing because where they strike out on their own, as the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation said in his last answer, they invariably go wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and his interest. Last sitting week I was able to inform honourable members that out of 43 of the 44 health funds in Australia we had had 41 funds that were not going to increase their premiums this year. One tiny fund was having a small increase; one larger fund was having a decrease. This is a result that is unprecedented and certainly has not happened in the time since we have kept records on private health insurance.Yesterday evening I made a determination on the 44th fund, HBF in Western Australia, a large fund of 594,000 members and unique amongst the health insurance funds in Australia because they had chosen to put in for a premium increase. Their profits this year are substantial - $28 million in the first seven months of the year - and our projections on industry-wide assumptions are that even without a premium increase they would make a profit next financial year. On this basis it was impossible for me on public interest grounds to allow this premium increase, so I have in fact disallowed it. HBF will have to decide whether they choose to accept this course or take the government to the Federal Court. It is a pity that HBF chose to be unique amongst all the health insurance funds in Australia but I simply was not prepared to allow families on top cover, with ancillaries to pay, to have to pay another $1.60 a week in a premium increase at a time when funds are making record profits. A premium increase by HBF could be a signal for other funds in Australia to have a round of premium increases. Indeed, we had been informed by one large fund that they would have to reconsider their opinion should that happen, and that would take us right back to where we were under the Labor Party. In accordance with the law I am happy to table my declaration and a statement of reasons for doing so.</DOC>

 - The member for Burke asked me what I would say to these lessors in relation to the impact of dairy deregulation on their property. The first thing I would say would be to ask them what has their state Labor government done to help them. Not a single thing. In common with all other dairy farmers around Australia their answer will be that their state Labor government has done absolutely nothing to help them, nothing whatsoever. They have stood idly by. They have passed the legislation. They have implemented the deregulation. But they have done nothing whatsoever anywhere to assist dairy farmers around Australia to address adjustment issues.By contrast, this government has responded in full to the industry's request for us to provide an adjustment package. We have provided a $1.78 billion restructuring package to particularly assist those farmers most in need who have required the greatest level of adjustment. That package has been appreciated by dairy farmers, who have noted the contrast in the way the coalition has addressed the issues of dairy farmers compared with what Labor have failed to do. Even now, we have the Labor Party with their so-called dairy policy, announced recently at their latest talkfest, which will effectively strip away the assistance that is available to help dairy communities.   - I am wondering what the honourable member for Paterson thinks about a Labor Party policy that is going to take $20 million off regional communities, the very sort of support that the people of Gloucester need at this time when they have such difficulties. - As if it is not bad enough that the Labor Party at the state level, where they have been in power, did nothing for dairy farmers around Australia, now we have the Labor Party at the federal level saying that they are going to take away some of the assistance that we have already put on the table to help farmers in areas like Gloucester. - Mr Speaker, I repeat: this government acted, Labor has failed. In relation to the case referred to by the honourable member, naturally I am not aware personally of the details of that individual. But I make a couple of comments about lessors and lessees to the effect that, as I indicated earlier, this government responded fully and in detail to the request of the industry about how we should address individual entitlements under the scheme. - That included the way in which the adjustment assistance was divided between lessors and lessees. This matter was also considered by a Senate committee of inquiry in great detail, and they endorsed the government's response to this issue. Members opposite voted for a distribution in this way. So it is utterly hypocritical for the honourable member to be asking questions about the distribution in this case when they voted precisely for this sort of a division between lessors and lessees. This government have demonstrated a willingness to consider the issues associated with dairy deregulation. We have shown compassion where the other side have shown nothing but scorn. We have endeavoured to address issues where hardship has been identified where Labor have been prepared to do nothing. In relation to lessors and lessees, we are also prepared to look at particular circumstances where hardship might have occurred and, as has always been the trait of this government in dealing with dairy deregulation, we will be sympathetic to those who are facing genuine need. We will respond positively to circumstances where we can help. Labor just want to strip away that assistance and leave communities utterly defenceless.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. When my distinguished predecessor, the member for Flinders, was introducing the workplace relations bill into this House members opposite lined up one after another, led by the Leader of the Opposition, to say that Australian workplace agreements constituted a vicious and savage attack on workers' wages. I am sure that members opposite will be pleased to learn that yesterday the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the latest figures which show that workers on awards average $610 a week, workers on collective agreements average $711 a week and workers on Australian workplace agreements average $895 a week. So workers on Australian workplace agreements are 25 per cent better off than workers on collective agreements. - That is right; this man is better than we thought. This is the news that members opposite did not need -  - this is the news that members opposite feared most, because the policy of the members opposite is simply to abolish Australian workplace agreements. The ALP's 2000 platform and constitution says:Labor will abolish Australian Workplace Agreements ... which are secretive, unreviewable and unfair.What is unfair about a 25 per cent pay increase? Labor was not always going to abolish Australian workplace agreements. In 1998 the Leader of the Opposition was going to keep them - admittedly subject to review by the Industrial Relations Commission - but last year he was rolled by Doug Cameron of the Metal Workers Union, who was otherwise going to persuade the ALP's conference to vote in favour of tariff increases.Let the people of Australia know that Labor will abolish Australian workplace agreements. This means a 25 per cent pay cut for hundreds of thousands of Australian workers. It means that the Leader of the Opposition will be putting his hand into their pockets, taking out their wallets, getting $185 a week out and ripping it up in front of them. What Labor means is lower pay and more strikes. That is the simple message: lower pay and more strikes under the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - Members opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot say on the one hand that Australian workplace agreement workers are the lowest of the low and on the other hand that Australian workplace agreement workers are the best of the best. They simply cannot have it both ways. What members opposite are trying to do is to impugn the ABS. They are saying that the Australian Bureau of Statistics is wrong. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is the world's most respected statistician and the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that Australian workplace agreement workers are $185 a week better off than workers on collective agreements. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his novel question on the matter of the government's defence white paper. I am not surprised that he would ask such a question, because in the last few weeks in the parliament and in public debate a question has been asked: what is the Labor Party's defence policy and what will the Labor Party do if ever they might be elected? We have had so many answers to this question from the Leader of the Opposition and/or his staff and the shadow minister that I am not surprised that people are slightly confused. Going back to the submarine saga of recent weeks, we were first told by the Labor Party that they supported the government's white paper. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition was writing in the Australian telling me to get on with it. When we started asking about their 1998 policy, we were told, `You can have free submarines,' because Labor was going to change the priority of acquisition purchases as a means of paying for them. So was born the saga of the two free subs and the free ANZAC battalion and the free bombing range. As the saga unfolded, we were then told that the 1998 policy was in fact null and void - a point that I made to the parliament only in the last few days.We were then subjected to the entertainment of the shadow minister after question time taking us full circle from the day a month or two months back when he said he supported the white paper to when the policy was then null and void. He finally got back up yesterday and said, `In fact, we do support the white paper.' If they support the white paper, how is it that they still have a commitment to two additional submarines and how are they going to pay for them? How are you going to pay for them? - I do appreciate an ill-informed and peremptory interjection when you ask, `Where is that?' The answer comes from your own words, because you said that the policy was null and void after the 1998 election. How is it that in the middle of last year the Advertiser had this headline: `Beazley pledges a clean river and two new subs'. It did not die in 1998. He has been running around advocating two or three subs. Well, we want to know where the money is coming from. It is no good for the Leader of the Opposition to answer through a spokesman. He is definitely running the defence policy - what there is of it. He is even issuing the shadow minister's press releases - under the shadow minister's name. He has his chief of staff in the gallery backing up the position. The fact of the matter is that last week he said, `You are not going to be told about Labor's defence policy until after the next election.' That is not good enough. Do not stand here and tell us that you support the white paper but that you will not tell us what your policy is until after the next election. You either do or do not support this white paper, and it is certainly not good enough for you to prevaricate. The Leader of the Opposition was the worst defence minister this country has had for decades. He now goes to the Australian people and says, `Put me in the Lodge.' We are entitled to say on behalf of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian public, `We want to know what your defence policy is.' Do not try to run; do not try to hide. It is about time we had a decent statement from you instead of having your shadow up here with these prevarications on a policy position that treats the Australian public in an arrogant way. I believe there ought to be a clear statement of your position.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I think it is an excellent tactic that every time I am asked by a member of the government a question on defence the opposition immediately follow up with their own. - All I can say to you is, `Good luck to you.' Good luck to you with the best question you can draft and put up. I can assure you that you will get a good answer every time. - In respect of expenditure, as you will see in due course, the expenditure in respect of defence will be in accordance with the white paper. We are entirely committed to that.  - If there is some part of my department, however, that wishes to improve their services to the minister, as far as I am concerned they can do so within the budget already allocated - full stop.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson. I know small businesses in his electorate are raising concerns about roll-back. Roll-back is the central plank of the Labor Party's platform, and it means changes to the fundamentals of the tax system. These changes will disrupt business stability. It is not about a finetuning of the tax system; it is about wave after wave of change. It is interesting to see the reaction and listen to what small business and small business organisations are saying about roll-back, because small business realises the dangers of roll-back. The Morgan and Banks survey found that 90.5 per cent of respondents reject roll-back. The Yellow Pages survey found that almost two-thirds of small business reject roll-back. Last week's Business Review Weekly survey found that 79 per cent of Australia's chief executives do not support roll-back. Rob Bastian, chair of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, stated on 13 July last year: Roll-back would increase complexity, increase supervision and means increased fear.He went on to say:Mr Beazley is taking the usual political stand to keep his powder dry, but that position is not going to help. It is becoming an albatross around his neck.The simple reason that small business are rejecting roll-back is that it will impose a financial burden on them. It will require them to change their business systems - not once but time and time again. The shadow minister for small business, the member for Hunter, admitted as much on ABC Radio when he said that roll-back can come with a cost for small business. Roll-back can come with a cost for small business! The small business shadow minister has fessed up on roll-back and he has been caught out.Labor is running around having inquiries which are a sham. The inquiry does not even have, as one of its terms of reference, the impact of roll-back. Roll-back will cost small business money. The inquiry held by the ALP is a stunt. </DOC>

 - The number of beds allocated to South Australia in the year 2000 round was in fact 765. There were some 1,475 places that went to South Australia, including community aged care packages. The problem in South Australia with regard to so-called bed blockages in hospitals, which Mr Brown has been speaking about, has arisen because, despite the fact that the federal government put $26 million of extra money into hospitals in this current budget, the South Australian government withdrew $20 million. In other words, what you have seen in South Australia -  -  - This morning I was indeed talking about this matter on air in South Australia, because I had come to the conclusion that the disgraceful attitude of state ministers across Australia in saying that older Australians were `bed blockers' because they need to be in hospital for longer periods was not acceptable. Older Australians are just as entitled to hospital care as anybody else in this country, and that includes you, Mr Speaker, or any member of the opposition or any member of the government. To see older Australians treated without respect and to have the South Australian minister withdrawing $20 million of their own funding for hospitals and then saying, `We will accept the money but we won't accept the responsibility and we will try to make it someone else's responsibility,' is just not acceptable.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie not only for her question but also for her interest in Work for the Dole. I know that before she came to this place she was working in the employment services area and she understands the need for self-esteem and practical experience for those who are unemployed, and she understands that Work for the Dole delivers just that. I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge many of the finalists in the national Work for the Dole achievement awards which will be presented tonight by the Prime Minister. I would like to congratulate all of you on your achievement and welcome you to the Australian parliament.This program, which is a signature project of the Howard government, is something that has overwhelming support within the Australian public because it builds on the fine partnerships between government and community work coordinators, between community work coordinators and the participants and between government and those communities throughout Australia which benefit from having people like those up in the gallery, both supervisors and participants, in building better communities and real opportunities. It is worth mentioning that the main principle behind Work for the Dole is real job experience. The best way for anyone to be able to get a job is to be able to demonstrate that they understand the commitments that are required of a workplace. That is the practical experience that Work for the Dole delivers. It is a good program that has great support. It has more than 90 per cent public support and, interestingly enough, amongst those who have participated or who are likely to participate in the program, more than 80 per cent support the project. I am also asked whether there are any alternative policies in this area. I trawled back through anything that the shadow spokesman may have said in this area. She was first appointed to the shadow portfolio on 3 October. In a press clipping headed `Transition to employment and training portfolio,' she says:I look forward to contributing to the development of alternative policies for the Labor government.We look forward to her doing that, too, because to this date it still has not happened. I then had a look at the new web page, which is headed, `Kim Beazley's policy page: my plan for our country'. I put these search criteria in an advanced search, name: Kim Beazley; portfolio: Leader of the Opposition; match all words: Work for the Dole. The response I got was not a number of pages of information but, `Sorry, no results on given key words.' Maybe we had it wrong, so we had another look at `Kim Beazley's policy page: my plan for our country,' and this time we searched for Kim Beazley, Leader of the Opposition, and the key words, `employment and services'. Of course, what did we get back? `Sorry, no results on given key words.' The fact is, the opposition has no policy for the recipients of Work for the Dole and it has no care or responsibility for those who are in employment. - When you actually announce a policy it will be a bright day for us all, because it has not happened yet. You failed in regional services and you are failing in employment services.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. His spokesman on telecommunications has been trying to beat this issue up. He was in here quivering with mock rage in a most extraordinary way this morning. But the fact is that he is not the slightest bit concerned about the probity of the government's actions regarding the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2000; he is not worried about the answers I gave on previous occasions on this matter; least of all is he worried about the adequacy of postal services in rural and regional Australia. The only reason he is upset is that the removal of this bill from consideration has exposed his ongoing deceit. This false claim that he gives a damn about services in rural and regional Australia has been exposed, as have the misrepresentations and distortions that he puts to the Australian media on this.I said on Monday, and I repeat now, that it is absurd to describe the actions that the government was taking as either deregulation or privatisation of Australia Post. That was perfectly accurate on Monday, and it is accurate now. The shadow spokesman in particular, picked up now by the Leader of the Opposition, is upset because he can no longer dissemble on this issue - that is what this is about. He is upset because he fears that he might have to stand on the Labor Party's record on post offices: 277 closed in contrast to the 105 that have opened since we have been in government. His problem is that country people have long memories. They remember where those post offices once were, and they are able to see where we have reopened them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his very real interest - particularly in representing Tamworth, one of the busiest regional airports in Australia - in the future of Sydney airport in general and access to it more particularly. I can advise the House that the government has determined to sell Sydney airport through a 100 per cent trade sale to be completed in the second half of this year. We will be imposing stringent limits on foreign ownership, including ownership by foreign airlines. Sydney airport will always be majority Australian owned. The government has also decided that the other Sydney basin airports, including Bankstown, will be sold through a 100 per cent trade sale in the second half of next year, 2002. We will retain the existing operating arrangements at Sydney airport to protect regional New South Wales and the residents of inner Sydney as well. The government will not allow the private sector operator of Sydney airport to increase landing charges unfairly as a way of forcing regional airlines to Bankstown Airport. We recognise that Sydney airport is an essential transport hub for regional New South Wales. In fact, over 40 per cent of regional passengers arriving at Sydney airport connect with flights to other destinations. It is not feasible for those people to land at Bankstown Airport and then crawl slowly through the traffic to meet their connecting flights. So regional New South Wales will always need direct access to Sydney airport, even though Bankstown will become an attractive alternative for some airline services over time.The government will be issuing a directive to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to give effect to our policy on regional pricing. The airport will not be able to increase the charges on regional airlines by more than the inflation rate, even in peak periods. The decision builds on the discussion paper that I released earlier this week, which details amendments to the slot scheme which will protect regional access to Sydney airport and make that scheme work more effectively. Our decision will also protect Sydney residents. I stress that the curfew and the 80 movements per hour cap will remain in place and I will be recommending that the private sector lessee of Bankstown Airport should be required to do a full environmental impact statement into the upgrading of the airport.The honourable member asked me if there were any alternative policies. The opposition's platform says that they will build a second airport in the Sydney basin. There is no word of where it will be, where the flight paths will be or how it will be funded. The residents of Sydney have a clear right to certainty. The government has a clear, sensible and appropriate plan for addressing Sydney's airport needs, and it is time for the policy-lazy opposition to produce the details of its plans for Sydney.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that the government has introduced a very fair and just funding policy for non-government schools which corrects some of the gross inequities that prevailed under the Labor Party for 13 years. The government is providing, of course, increased funding for the neediest schools in the non-government sector and has introduced, through its socioeconomic status index, appropriate funding according to the income levels of school communities. As a result of that, there are schools which benefit significantly from this system, because they were grossly underfunded by the Labor Party. As a result of the states grants legislation, which was passed by the parliament in December, and the funding that is provided through that legislation in the states, government school students in 2004 will be receiving some $8,000 per student. Students at Haileybury College will be receiving some 41 per cent of that amount; in other words, students in the secondary school at Haileybury College will be receiving some $3,367 per head compared with over $8,000 in total from Commonwealth and state governments for students at government schools.  -  - I take it that the Labor Party thinks that this is grossly unfair. - Yes, the Leader of the Opposition believes that it is grossly unfair that the parents of students at Haileybury College should be receiving $3,367 per student when if they had chosen to send their child to a government school they would be receiving over $8,000 per student. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition believes it is so unfair that students in category 1 should receive any increase that he proposes to take away all these increases from students in category 1. This is a totally unethical and immoral policy. Let me illustrate why: the Labor Party has accepted the fact that categories 2 to 12 were utterly flawed - because they have accepted in the legislation the SES funding formula for schools that were in those categories - yet it somehow expects us to believe that category 1 was not flawed.When we actually look at the schools in that category, we find that the Leader of the Opposition, as a consequence of his policy, will be ripping $3,007 per student away from the Bethel Learning Centre in the electorate Werriwa - a small school with fees of about $200 that operates out of a local hall. The Leader of the Opposition is going to take $3,000 per student away from that school, because it is a category 1 school that he sees as a wealthy school. He is also going to take $3,370 away from students at The School of Total Education in Warwick on the Darling Downs because that community school - as far as he is concerned - is a wealthy school. But listen to the justice in this: he is going to take $178 per head away from Shore on the North Shore of Sydney. So, the richer the school, the smaller the loss; the poorer the school, the larger the loss. The poorer schools are going to be punished by the Leader of the Opposition because they were unfortunate enough to fall into his totally corrupt and misleading category 1.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that on 1 July last year Commonwealth-state financial relations were reformed in a way which had never been done in 100 years of Australian federal history. Prior to that, once a year the premiers had come to Canberra and the night before, generally speaking, an offer of grants had been shuffled under their hotel room doors for discussion as to how much the Commonwealth would be funding them for essential services. Tomorrow the state treasurers will come to Canberra for the second intergovernmental meeting of the Commonwealth-state financial council, and we will not be negotiating grants which have been pulled out of a hat and shuffled under doors of hotels. Tomorrow we will be dividing up the revenue from the goods and services tax to be sent to governments to fund essential services in the six states and two territories of Australia. To give you some idea of this, Mr Speaker, in the forthcoming year the state of Victoria will be funded $5.5 billion out of the goods and services tax. It spends $4.6 billion on education. The goods and services tax paid to Victoria will fund the equivalent of every salary of every schoolteacher in every class in every school in Victoria. The goods and services tax will give Queensland a net sum of $5 billion. Queensland spends $3.5 billion on its education. The honourable member for Fadden, I know, is very interested in the way in which the education system works in Queensland. It spends $1.8 billion on police and justice. Do you know that the goods and services tax funds the equivalent of every teacher in Queensland and every policeman on the beat in Queensland?There will be no argument at the Commonwealth-state meeting tomorrow about the amount which will be given in total to the states. That is because the states, for the first time in federal history, now have a growth revenue - the goods and services tax. There will be an argument tomorrow as to how the goods and services tax is divided up between the states. Far from the Labor states repudiating goods and services tax, tomorrow we are going to have a big stoush as to who gets more of the goods and services tax. This has even prompted the state of New South Wales to take out full-page advertisements in the newspapers today featuring cane toads. The advertisements are entitled: `Guess which state gobbles up $190m of NSW taxes each year?' The allegation is that Queensland is getting too much GST and the Labor government of New South Wales would like some more. This prompted Mr Beattie, who wants more share of GST for his state, to describe Mr Carr as `childish and immature'. He said:The cockroaches have got a fight on their hands. We won't be stood over. This is the Centenary of Federation and they are trying to destroy the Federation.How do you destroy the Federation now? By taking GST revenue off Queensland. That is the argument from Premier Beattie: if you take GST revenue off Queensland, you are destroying the Federation. I table the cane toad advertisement that New South Wales is running.There is only one political risk to the new arrangement in relation to Commonwealth-state financial relations, and that is a federal Labor government. The states today are fighting for their share of GST. Far from being opposed to it, they are now scrambling over each other to get a bigger share of GST. The only threat to this would be a federal Labor government. Listen to what Mr Pat McKendry of the Retailers Association of Queensland said on Brisbane radio on Tuesday:I think the real point about this, Andrew, is that the promise of roll-back and the implications that has for the Commonwealth revenue as a direct result - state revenue - I think the southern states are getting increasingly nervous. The less money the federal government takes from the GST - and let's understand that if there is a Beazley government come December then there will be less money collected - there's going to be less money for the states.There will be less money for teachers, less money for police, less money for health and less money for hospitals. The only way that the Leader of the Opposition can roll back GST and guarantee health, education and police services is by increasing income taxes. The Leader of the Opposition will not spell out which items of goods and services he will take GST off because he does not want to spell out how much income taxes would go up under a Beazley government. This is the greatest reform to federal-state financial relations in the last 100 years. It was opposed all the way by the Australian Labor Party, and the only thing that threatens it today would be the election of a Labor government.</DOC>

 - I sympathise with the member for having had that question palmed off onto him by the tactics committee, because, if he had been aware of even the fundamental facts of the new funding policy, he would have realised that the schools that receive additional funding under our policy only receive the full funding increment by the year 2004. That means that they are receiving a quarter of that increment this year. Not only that; these schools at the moment are having their fees pushed up as a result of settlements which are being made with the teacher unions and as a result of the squeeze which they were under for the 13 years of the Labor Party and the Labor funding system, which will continue through until December this year. I can tell you that there have been quite a number of schools which have already indicated that they will be reducing their fees. - Wesley College in Melbourne has indicated that it is going to reduce its fees by $400 per student. That will be a great benefit -  - That will be a great benefit to the member of the frontbench opposite who takes advantage of the educational services of Wesley College for his children. I will not name the member, but he knows who he is. Geelong Grammar was mentioned. This is a school that services many families from regional and rural Australia where there have been big income falls. That school has indicated that it intends to provide all the increased money as scholarships for low income and needy students. In other words, that school is doing precisely what the member suggests no school is doing: it is throwing its doors wide open to students who would not otherwise receive any benefit.  - This gets close to the heart of this union party over there; it gets very close to their hearts. The Labor Party, of course, a very powerful sector -  - The consequence, of course, of the Leader of the Opposition's policy to abolish any of these funding increases to schools which have the misfortune to fall into his corrupt category 1 is that the students who would otherwise receive those scholarships from Geelong Grammar will no longer receive them. Quite a number of low income families, probably families from rural Victoria -   - who might have had access to a well-resourced school, built up by parents over many years, will now, under the Leader of the Opposition's policy, have no access. The leaders of the Labor Party themselves have no hesitation in using their income levels to send their children to non-government schools that are well resourced. That is what Paul Keating did. That is what Bob Hawke did. That is what the member for Hotham does. That is what the Leader of the Opposition does. Indeed, almost 50 per cent of the members on the Labor Party side of the House send their children to these non-government schools, yet the Leader of the Opposition is going to implement a policy which is going to slash thousands of dollars from low fee community schools and prevent low income families from regional Australia benefiting from the government's funding policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The dealings of any health minister with the medical profession can be fraught with danger, but perhaps one of the areas of some success over the last 18 months has been the memorandum of understanding process that has been run with peak general practice organisations, particularly the divisions of general practice, the rural doctors of Australia and the college of GPs. The MOU aims to enhance the stability and viability of general practice, and it has had some very significant achievements. We were able to increase rebates when the MOU was signed. We have been able to reverse Labor's decision to index rebates at half CPI for a prolonged period of time, and indeed indexation in the last two financial years, 2000 and 2001, is higher than it would have been because of the MOU. We have not sought to claw back embedded WST. In fact, GP rebates in the last 18 months have gone up 6.8 per cent - without the MOU, they would have gone up only 1.4 per cent - and this has led to $400 million extra going into general practice over the life of the MOU. We have also been able to address some long-standing irritations that GPs have had. Today, if someone sees a GP and needs a vaccine, that vaccine can be purchased directly from the GP as part of a bulk-billed consultation rather than requiring two consultations and a chemist visit, and the member of the public still having to pay a co-payment when visiting the chemist. There are faster payment times on manually lodged claims. GPs can connect their businesses directly to the Health Insurance Commission and we are just about to allow pay doctor cheques that are unpresented after 90 days to be transferred directly to doctors via electronic funds transfer. We have had a significant rural component - $12 million went to the rural retention payment system, $5 million for accommodation for GP registrars and increased rebates from 1 January this year to non-vocationally recognised general practitioners in rural areas. We have 18 months to go. We believe there is much more we can do with this. We are working cooperatively with general practitioners, and I believe there is still more to come from what has been a very successful initiative.</DOC>

 - The Wesley College to which the member refers is a school whose parents will receive in 2004 from us a subsidy of $2,346 per student. That will compare with over $8,000 per student which those parents would receive if they sent their child to a government school. The parents have to make up the rest of the money that is required to resource that school. They do so, saving the taxpayer a great deal of money. Many of the students have both parents working to send their children to that school. This is a school which has been disadvantaged for many years by the Labor Party's iniquitous funding policy. It is a school whose parents receive some 28.7 per cent of the funding that they would get if they sent their child to a government school. The Labor Party think that is very unfair - that we should give as much as 28.7 per cent to parents who send their child to a non-government school - but they think it is entirely fair that, if you go to a government school, you get 100 per cent. These parents at Wesley are, of course, paying their full taxes as well. This is a school whose costs have been pushed up year after year by the Labor Party's funding system, which we have just abolished.Let me just make the broader point to set this in context: the government is providing increased funding to all schools, both government and non-government, under its states grants legislation. Government schools receive $1.6 billion more under the legislation passed in December than they received over the last four years. Government schools, public schools, in Australia have seen their funding levels rise by 37 per cent over the last four years - well over $500 million more is being provided to public schools in this country each year by the Howard government than was provided by the Labor Party when in office. We are talking here about a context of school funding which provides the biggest investment in the education of young Australians that any federal government has ever made. As I have indicated, schools like Wesley College and numbers of other schools have also indicated that, when they receive the funding entitlement that they will under this policy, they will be reducing their fees, and that will be welcomed by many students and many families. Our policy will continue to put a downward pressure on school fees.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. We have already seen that the Labor Party, if ever elected, intends to pursue the iniquitous policy of taking thousands of dollars away from low fee community schools. -  - It is not denied by the Leader of the Opposition. That is a consequence of the Labor Party's policy from the Leader of the Opposition. But this does not end the iniquity of the education policies for which the Labor Party is well known. When this government came to office we found that the greatest obstacle to low income families making a choice about the school they felt best suited their children was the Labor Party's new schools policy. This was a policy that was negotiated between the Labor Party and the Australian Education Union in 1985. Its aim was to prevent new schools that served low income communities from opening up. The Labor Party connived with the iniquitous policy of the Australian Education Union to stop low income families having a choice of school. We abolished that policy, and that was hailed by low income communities around Australia as finally offering them the opportunity to choose the school for their child. As a result of this policy, between 1997 and 2000, some 221 new schools were approved for Commonwealth funding. One of the interesting features of these schools that were approved is that 46 of them existed before 1996 but were not funded by the Labor Party, in whole or in part, even though registered by the state governments, because of the new schools policy. In other words, under Labor you can send your child to a school of your choice and get no money at all, no support. That is what the policy of the Australian Education Union is all about, because it believes in no funding for non-government schools. The kinds of compromises the Labor Party reached - and the weak Leader of the Opposition, when he was education minister, was very happy to reach - with the Australian Education Union were a policy that denied any funding to many students in non-government schools and denied any support to their parents even though those parents were paying their full share of taxation. Our policy has restored justice in this area. As Peter Crimmins, the Executive Director of the Australian Association of Christian Schools, said:Choice in schooling is now a reality for working-class Australian families. The Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition tell you that these are all unnecessary schools, that we do not need these schools. Tell that to the parents of the Manning River Steiner School in Taree. Tell that to the parents of the Norman Park Christian School in Rockhampton. Tell that to the parents of the low fee Anglican schools in Western Sydney, like the Penrith Anglican College in Orchard Hills and the Thomas Hassall Anglican College in Hoxton Park. Tell that to the parents at the Islamic schools like the Al-Faisal College in Auburn. Our policy has made it possible for families who never before could contemplate school choice to choose their school. And - make no mistake - when the Labor Party gets back into power, the Leader of the Opposition will not only take great pleasure in slashing $3,000 from the Bethel Education Centre out in Western Sydney; not only take great pleasure in taking away $3,000 per student from the Warwick School of Total Education in the Darling Downs; he will also be reintroducing the new schools policy. He will be reintroducing the new schools policy because that is very clear in the Hobart platform of the Labor Party. It says quite clearly:Labor will establish minimum enrolment requirements and accountability standards for the establishment of new non-government schools. Those already exist at the state level. - The Leader of the Opposition asks whether non-government schools should be accountable. Yes, they should be equally accountable - and the strongest accountability standards ever implemented are in the Howard government state grants legislation of last December. For the first time, non-government schools are equally accountable with government schools. That was never the case under the Labor Party, and the Hobart platform of the Labor Party makes it quite clear that that iniquitous new schools policy is coming back, and that is very bad news for low income families in Australia who want to choose the most appropriate school for their child.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, some questions are really quite hard to believe. You just wonder what is going on in that tactics committee.  - Let me just run through the absurdities in that question. We will start at the back. Youth unemployment has halved under this government. It was 34 per cent under the Leader of the Opposition when he was employment minister and it has come right down under this government so that it is now under five per cent of the total cohort of teenagers who are looking for -  - Youth unemployment has halved. That is the fact; check it out. - It is a fact. - Secondly, we hear about a decline in training places. There has been an increase under this government -  - Yes, I will get to that. There has been an increase under this government of some 386,000 places in TAFE over the last five years, a massive increase in training opportunities. The number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships has more than doubled under this government to 294,000 in December - more than double what the Labor Party achieved. The member for Dickson asked me whether there was a decline in commencements last year. The answer is, yes, there has been a national decline in commencements but this decline is concentrated in one state. This decline is concentrated in the state of Queensland - and it is a direct result of the policies of the Labor Party government in that state. They make no secret of it because they - under pressure, of course, from their union mates - have introduced a whole set of new regulations which you are required to fulfil, if you are a small business employer, to take on a trainee. So the Queensland government have devastated the traineeship system in that state. I understand that they are now worried by the consequences of their policies.What we see in Queensland has been duplicated in other ways in other states. New South Wales has a pathetically low number of apprentices and trainees relative to the population of that state - in fact, it has fewer than the state of Victoria, even though it is a much larger state in terms of population - because it has been such a highly regulated, Trades Hall Council dominated training system under the Carr government. If the Labor Party were ever to get into power, we would see once again what we saw when Labor were in government previously. Remember that in 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships was the lowest for three decades. The Leader of the Opposition, in his first year as Minister for Employment, Education and Training, destroyed 20,000 apprenticeships. They are the realities. - The Leader of the Opposition was, as we know, a very indifferent and bored education minister. He said he lost heart when he got the portfolio. He could not think of anything to do, yet 30 per cent of young people could not read and write properly. The Labor Party had devastated the apprenticeship system, yet he could not think of anything to do. If they ever get back into government, we will see yet another devastation of opportunities for young Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley. He is a strong and constant advocate for small business in his electorate. Small businesses in the electorate of Dunkley, as small businesses everywhere, recognised long ago the need for tax reform. This government had the courage to deliver that reform. Through that reform, small business has gained from lower company rates of tax, lower personal income tax rates, lower capital gains tax rates and, soon to be introduced, a better regime of depreciation. There is an alternative, of course, being proposed by the Labor Party. It is called roll-back. It is about exemptions from the current system for goods and services provided, and it will hit small business in wave after wave of complexity. It has serious implications for government and small business, and the shadow minister - always on radio having a word - admitted that it would have an impact on small business. Let me read the transcript. - I am going to. It is from ABC 7NT in northern Tasmania. It says:Compere: Okay, what will roll-back specifically mean for small business?Joel Fitzgibbon: Well. Rollback can come with a cost and without a cost.The shadow minister, the member for Hunter, has admitted that small business will face a cost from roll-back. - I have just read it. I will read it again. The compere said:Okay, what will roll-back specifically mean for small business?Joel Fitzgibbon: Well. Rollback can come with a cost and without a cost.Then the member for Hunter tried to deny in the House yesterday that he actually said it by saying that roll-back will come at a cost to government - the double whammy. First of all he admits that it will come at a cost to small business; then he admits that it is going to come at a cost to government. What this means is either higher taxes or a deficit, which means higher interest rates for small business. - The member for Hunter knows, as small business knows, that roll-back is going to be bad for small business and it is going to be bad for Australia. In two fits of candour, he had the courage last week to admit what his leader will not admit: roll-back is bad for Australia and bad for small business.</DOC>

 - I would certainly like the honourable member for Calare to provide me with details of this particular family as I am not in a position to speak directly on it. What I can tell the honourable member for Calare is that there were substantial changes made to the youth allowance. These were positive changes, particularly for many families when they sent their children away for education. For the first time, many people on youth allowance were able to receive rent assistance which they were never entitled to before; this was a substantial increase. Likewise with families, there have been substantial increases in family tax benefit that came through with the changes to the new taxation system, which range between $20 and $50. As far as the actual assessment income test is concerned, yes, we did put that in, and the reason for that was that we were concerned that some families in the past were sheltering their income in obvious ways to minimise it to claim youth allowance, which if their assessable income had been used would have been inappropriate. That is why the new changes were brought into place for youth allowance. If you have a particular situation, as I mentioned in my introduction, I am happy to look at it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his interest in defence matters. He reflects the broad interest on this side of the House to support Australia's defence forces, which we have done with the implementation of the white paper. Yes, there have been criticisms from the Labor Party, made as recently as yesterday, about a shortage of ammunition in respect of the land forces. This is a pretty incredible criticism from the Labor Party, which for years ran down the land forces. In response to their running down the land forces, we now find that this government in its white paper specifically made provision for additional ammunition for the land forces. This is a classic case. They create the problem; they are critical of many aspects of the operation of the Defence Force; and of course we are the ones providing a solution to the very problems that they created. In the white paper we have an additional $30 million for rebuilding ammunition war stocks and an additional $10 million to be spent each subsequent year over the next five years, and $17.9 million this year has been allocated to increasing the amount of training ammunition available. This is all within a package of over $5 billion which is directed to fill the holes created by Labor's mismanagement when they were responsible for the land forces. So the criticism is a bit rich.The opposition yesterday made a claim of additional spending, which I later found out had not in fact ever been put to me. They made a claim of a proposition, which has not yet been put to me and which has not been approved. Yet, when we look back over Labor's administration of the Defence Force, the Defence Force suffered years and years of maladministration, inefficiency and bungling from none other than the Leader of the Opposition, who for many years was in charge of Australia's defence forces. When we took over back in 1996, an internal Army assessment of their resources found that their land force structure was inadequate, the elements of the force were hollow and there were significant deficiencies in structure, training and equipment, to name just a few of the range of inadequacies which we inherited after 13 years of Labor Party neglect. No-one should forget that it was the Labor Party in government - and no-one should forget that the Leader of the Opposition was a defence minister - that in fact abolished two regular full-time infantry battalions and replaced them with two Ready Reserve battalions, but which could not be deployed.  - It was this government, once we were elected, that started to address the problems of inadequacy in the Defence Force and that finally gave it the capacity to go to East Timor, as it did so successfully. None other than Hugh White, a former adviser to the Leader of the Opposition and to Bob Hawke and, most recently, deputy secretary in charge of development of the white paper, said this last year in a seminar on the white paper: If the government had not decided at significant expense to expand the Army in November-December last year, we would not have had the forces to sustain the deployment on East Timor, to undertake the commitments we have in the Olympics and also keep available in Townsville a brigade or two up our sleeve in case something else goes wrong.We do not need any lecturing from the opposition when it comes to the Army. They ran the Army down and it is this government that has put in the money, the resources and the support to bring the Army back to what it is today and what it will be in the future.</DOC>

 - The first thing to be said about that catamaran is that the reason it was leased for a period ending, I think, some time in the middle of this year is that the two craft that otherwise would have been available to provide us with the heavy lift to go to East Timor were not ready to fulfil that task. These are the two LPAs which the Leader of the Opposition, I think, was responsible for purchasing at a cost of $60 million. These rust buckets, bought for $60 million, three or four years later and $400 million of taxpayers' money having been spent, were still not ready and available to provide us with the lift for the Army to go to East Timor. How you can ask a question about the cat, given the abominable record of mismanagement when the Labor Party was in government, absolutely defies description.The state of play in respect of the cat is this. There was a lease of that particular piece of equipment through to, I think it was, May or June - I stand to be corrected - but certainly in the middle of this year. I have received a brief from the department in that respect. The advice that I have had from the department is that they have carried out a full assessment and a study of the future possible uses of that particular piece of equipment. - For us to keep that particular piece of equipment would mean that we would be doubling up, on top of the additional $400 million which had to be paid for the rust buckets. - No, there is a fair question there and I would like to answer it. The builders of that boat are very keen to secure offshore orders and I think everybody would like to see them and the other shipbuilder do well. So I have had representatives from the company in to talk to me about it. Obviously, I am not keen for us to be paying for more capability than we have already paid for, but, if there is something that we can, in conjunction with them, manage in respect of that ship, then I would be keen to do so, and there have been negotiations. -  - So I deny all of the claims you want to make, because I have had a discussion and I have sought for the defence forces to have further discussions with Mr Clifford. - If we can come to some arrangement which is in their interests and a reasonable position from the government's point of view, we will. </DOC>

 - That is a most timely and appropriate question, I must say. I suppose the good news for the House is that in respect of the Collins class submarines, unlike the heavy lifts, the Kanimbla and the Manoora, the cost did not go from $60 million to $400 million. However, in respect of the Collins class, the original cost, I think, was estimated and announced to be $2.6 billion. It is today at about $5.1 billion. The question asks what additional funding we are looking to have to make it operational. Well, $266 million was approved by the government in December 1999 to achieve limited operational capability for two of the boats, which has now been achieved - another example of this government fixing up the mistakes of the Leader of the Opposition and other ministers for defence when Labor was in power.In September 2000 the government approved an additional $72 million - working out your next question, are you? - for propellor and hull improvements to another two submarines during this year. And, on top of all that, probably in the vicinity of $700 million will have to be provided to complete all the platform fixes and to replace the submarines' combat system. In other words, $5.1 billion and start counting another billion on top of that, give or take a few hundred.This is the sort of defence policy that you get when you have 13 years of Labor maladministration of defence - and we have the Leader of the Opposition putting himself up to be Prime Minister and in charge of our defence forces again! There is only one side of this parliament that has shown a capacity to properly manage the defence forces and to provide a 10-year plan, and it is this side. What a disgrace your record is on defence.</DOC>

 - The Australian government is very concerned for the policyholders of HIH, of which there were more than a million. The primary focus of the efforts of the government, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the general insurance industry should be the interests of policyholders. Without APRA's support the alliances which have provided support to policyholders - the alliances between HIH, QBE, NRMA and Allianz - would not have been possible, and these alliances have provided support to the overwhelming majority of policyholders. APRA has appointed an inspector to HIH, and I understand that was recently. - That was recently, after HIH failed to lodge their returns with APRA. This process was begun prior to the company going into liquidation. I have, at APRA's request -   - I have, at APRA's request, agreed to APRA issuing directions that will prevent the provisional liquidator from doing anything that will disadvantage policyholders, and this is further protection for HIH policyholders. I can further advise the House that ASIC has been investigating HIH and its former directors for some weeks in relation to corporate governance, market disclosure and possible insolvent trading. Now is not the time for anyone to be giving a running commentary on APRA -  - ASIC or any other government agency, state or federal, that is involved in the provisional liquidation of HIH. - The best use of all available resources from APRA, from ASIC, from all government agencies and from the general insurance industry overall is to try and protect more than one million policyholders who have been disadvantaged by the provisional liquidation of HIH.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Moreton for his question. Last Monday the Labor Party released its banking policy, and the Leader of the Opposition was standing outside a closed Westpac branch in Kingston where he claimed, under his policy, `Labor will re-establish banking services to areas from which they have been removed.' To do this, the Labor Party has pledged to spend $20 million a year, and that will be levied on the banking industry generally. Under the Labor Party's unique accounting procedures, $20 million a year will fund a nationwide financial services education plan covering investment advice, fee and charge advice and consumer complaints mechanisms. The $20 million a year will fund the financial services advisory board, a new regulatory body to oversee the social charter. The $20 million a year will fund the social charter, including five million totally fee-free accounts for social security recipients, as well as a disability plan, a credit plan and a small business plan. The $20 million fund will fund individual monitoring of bank services on a community by community basis in hundreds of towns and in thousands of suburbs across Australia. And the $20 million fund will deliver 500 new bank branches that closed in the last three years of Labor in government. There is some phoney accounting there. It is a bit like the free submarines that we heard about a little earlier. Who pays for this? It is obviously going to be the customers of financial institutions who are going to pay, and in particular it is going to be the customers of credit unions who are going to pay. For example, if you take the electorate of the member for Herbert, the Discovery Credit Union will have to pay $6,000 a year to pay for Labor's policy. In the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate, the Goldfields Credit Union members will have to pay $3,000 a year. In the member for Moreton's electorate, the 500 members of the Karpaty Ukrainian Credit Union, which we went and visited the other day, will have to pay about $3,000 a year. In the member for Richmond's electorate, the Southern Cross Credit Union members in Tweed Heads will have to pay around $12,000 a year. Even in the Labor Party, what will the member for Bass say when she goes to the Launceston Examiner and says that the members of the Connect Credit Union in Tasmania will have to pay $40,000 a year? Even their mates in the Victorian Teachers Credit Union will have to pay $45,000 a year to pay for Labor's banking policies. It does not add up. The credibility of the Labor Party on banking is ruined, primarily because their policy does not have credibility and because their policy lacks integrity.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In 1998 the Commonwealth negotiated a new five-year Australian health care agreement with the states. Under this five-year agreement, which runs from the middle of 1998 to 2003, the government will provide $31.7 billion to the states and territories for their public hospitals. This is a massive increase of 28 per cent over the previous health care agreement from 1993 to 1998. What is more, this is all new money; it is not a fiddle with financial assistance grants, which is what occurred with the previous health care agreement. During the last year of the Labor government, states and territories were provided with $4.5 billion for public hospitals. In contrast, at the end of this agreement it will be $6.9 billion. This represents a $2.4 billion increase, or 55 per cent, over a decade. The state by state figures are interesting. What we have found is that, while the Commonwealth has been consistently and substantially increasing its funding, the states have not come to the party. Since the 1998-99 budget, the New South Wales government has reduced its contribution to the state hospital system by $33 million, which compares with an increase from the Commonwealth of $194 million. Over the 1999-2000 financial year, the New South Wales government reduced its own contribution to the health system by a massive $93 million, including an underspend of $63 million. In the honourable member's own state of South Australia, while total spending this financial year on hospital services is budgeted to increase by only $6 million, the Commonwealth's contribution is going up by $26 million. So, in other words, of the extra $26 million that we have sent to South Australia, they have pocketed $20 million for something else, put $6 million into hospitals and not increased their own contribution by one cent.Last week I was shown a brochure that was distributed in the honourable member's state but in the seat of Adelaide by the Labor Party. This brochure states that John Howard cut $800 million from our public hospital system when he first came to power and that he has held down funding ever since. The simple fact is that this year the funding under the Howard government is $6.3 billion for public hospitals - $1.8 billion more than Labor's last year of office - a 28.6 per cent increase in five years. This is further accentuated by the fact that we have fixed private health insurance. We are providing a new stream of revenue to states through private health funds that they were losing previously. So the next time that a Labor candidate wants to comment on public hospitals, I suggest that they do not use the research of the member for Jagajaga. Given that this was in the seat of Adelaide, I have the reply from the member for Adelaide to the person authorising the brochure. I have to say that it is a far more polite reply than I probably would have written and, for the benefit of honourable members, I will table it. </DOC>

 - I am aware of the comments referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. I have even read his scant dairy policy, which of course offers absolutely no hope to dairy farmers anywhere in Australia. Perhaps one of the worst features of his proposal is to strip away the assistance that this government has already provided to dairy communities through the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program and to therefore deny the opportunity to provide alternative jobs to the people of Gloucester, in the electorate of the member for Paterson, whose dairy factory has closed. He seeks to remove the capacity to provide additional funds in my electorate, where the dairy factory at Monto has closed, or in the electorate of Dawson, where the factory in Mackay has closed. What the people in these areas need to know is that it is Labor's policy to provide no assistance to those regional communities. All they are talking about is yet another talkfest. Labor members have been wandering around, endeavouring to glean from local communities cases that they can raise in parliament where there have been problems, but the reality is that they have no answers.I have had a large number of meetings with dairy industry leaders. I have met with processors, I have met with retailers and I have met with all of the district organisations. In his question, the Leader of the Opposition referred to Mr Horan, the National Party leader in Queensland, but he is now not in the least bit interested in hearing the answer. He has turned his back on the facts in the same way that he turns his back on the dairy industry. He could not care less about the dairy farmers of Australia; he turns his back on the issue. He could not care less. I think that this is a shameful way to treat the people of Australia and particularly the dairy farmers. Mr Horan has organised a number of meetings with the dairy industry and has put together a plan, which was put to the people of Queensland at the last election. In my discussions with them, I have to say that the industry leaders have expressed no desire whatsoever to have a roundtable conference of the nature referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. Indeed, the proposal has been specifically rejected by them. I therefore will be working individually with the parties to seek to establish resolutions to the many issues involved. This government will take a responsive and sympathetic approach to the needs of the dairy farmers - something that the Leader of the Opposition will never do. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. From the outset we should point out that the benefits to Australia's exporters of waterfront reform can be counted in tens of millions of dollars. Our government was elected to office to improve the economic circumstances of the Australian community, and particularly our exporters, and we have seen that happen in a number of dramatic ways, of course, with the economic reforms that we have introduced that have significantly benefited exporters, workplace relations reforms that have significantly benefited exporters and waterfront reform that has also significantly benefited Australia's exporters.Yesterday we saw the release of statistics in the BTE's Waterlinebrief which indicated significant improvement in the crane rate at Australia's container ports. Crane rates, at 25.5 lifts per hour, have for the first time exceeded the government's target of 25 container lifts per hour. This represents a 40 per cent increase in productivity since 1997. Australia's exporters, and significantly Australia's agricultural exporters, are the big winners out of this. Of course, we can all remember the opposition that the Australian Labor Party and their union mates had to these reforms. It took the election of a coalition government to have the backbone to address this most inefficient sector of Australia's economy to ensure that Australia's wool industry, Australia's cotton industry, Australia's beef industry and Australia's dairy industry - which was the subject of an opposition question - received the benefits of the reforms in this area. That has been widely acknowledged by a number of different areas. The NFF yesterday acknowledged:All farmers ever asked for of the waterfront was world's best practice. We expect our farmers to produce world's best practice. They expect the rest of the economy to support them with world's best practice.He went on to say that the cost of moving a container from south-east Australia to Japan used to be exactly double the cost of moving the same sort of product over a similar distance from California to Japan. But the best quote of all on yesterday's statistics did not necessarily come from an exporter. I will read the quote:I think it is fair to say that things have changed for the better. We have always been very positive about lifting productivity rates. Things have changed for the better.This is not coming from the government, it is not coming from the stevedores, it is not coming from exporters; in fact, that is a quote from the National Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia, Mr Paddy Crumlin. He is acknowledging the improvement that we have achieved over the last couple of years with these reforms. The thing that exporters do not want to see in the future is the election of a Labor government, a lazy Labor government in the future, under the control of the unions not just from without but also from within.</DOC>

 - I do not think the rest of the country is saying that. Certainly, the consumers of Australia are not saying it. Undoubtedly, and much to the chagrin and the disappointment of the opposition, today's retail trade figures would have been an enormous disappointment to the opposition, because they were very strong and buoyant and will not afford the Leader of the Opposition another opportunity to talk down the Australian economy. That is what the Leader of the Opposition does.The Leader of the Opposition invites me to respond to the judgment of the community. The consumers of Australia express views through the dollars they spend in the shops of Australia. If you look at the dollars that have been spent in the shops of Australia, Mr Speaker, you will find that the retail trade increased by 1.2 per cent in February, to be 8.1 per cent higher than this time last year. The increase in February is the third consecutive increase in retail spending, following a one per cent increase in December and a 1.1 per cent increase in January, both of which have been revised upwards by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I understand that today's outcome exceeded market expectations. The Leader of the Opposition invites me to listen to the people of Australia on this issue. The people of Australia are still spending, and the reason why the people of Australia are spending is that we went ahead with the personal tax cuts that you did not want us to go ahead with. In fact, about a year ago the Leader of the Opposition was accusing us of overheating the economy. A year ago he was running around saying, `It is terrible, they are overheating the economy.' Now he is running around talking the economy down. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition can do no better at question time than react to the headlines in this morning's newspapers.</DOC>

 - My attention has been drawn to such allegations. It may be that there is some remarkable coincidence, but there was an article in the Melbourne Sunday Herald Sun yesterday referring to a family, the Zank family, and there was also a statement released by the member for Lilley yesterday that referred to the Zank family. It may be that the member for Lilley had spoken to the journalist at the newspaper before the article was written, but it is a free country and he is perfectly entitled to do that. It would have been helpful if the journalist writing the article had bothered to make some inquiries about the veracity of what he was told by the honourable member for Lilley. Naturally, I do not know all of the particular circumstances of the Zank family - and I do not presume to make judgments on their particular circumstances - but I have sought generic advice in relation to families that are in a similar situation, and that generic advice is quite interesting.I have been informed that both the Sunday Herald Sun and the member for Lilley are wrong about the compensation provided to a family in similar circumstances - that is, one main breadwinner earning $30,000 a year with seven dependent children aged under 11. That was the material supplied in the newspaper article. I have been told by the Department of Family and Community Services that a family in these circumstances receives a tax cut of $17.34 a week, not $13.50, as reported by the Sunday Herald Sun; additional family payments of $55.12 a week, not $14 a week, as reported by the Sunday Herald Sun, or $2.50 a child per week, as claimed by the member for Lilley; and total compensation of $72.46 a week, or $3,768 a year. According to my advice, this represents an increase of eight per cent in disposable income. I have also been advised that a family in these circumstances receives in aggregate - not as an increase, of course - family assistance of $445.90 a week, or $23,187 a year. If that advice of mine is correct - and it is based on advice obtained from the department - then once again the member for Lilley has been caught red-handed conducting a fear campaign. He tried to scare the pensioners of Australia and now he is into scaring low income families in Australia. He should be ashamed of himself. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, because of the noise I did not hear the full question, but I do not ask that it be read again because I have a pretty fair idea it would have been the Deputy Leader of the Opposition trying to run down the Australian economy. I notice that he tried it on Friday, he tried it on Saturday, he tried it Sunday and he tried it on Monday. As the Prime Minister said, I said on the way down to question time it is a fair bet we will not get any questions about retail trade today, because if consumers are buying the Labor Party is unhappy.I have seen the ACCI survey, which said that 90 per cent of respondents expect growth in earnings to rise or stay the same; 75 per cent of respondents regard their own conditions to be satisfactory or better; 70 per cent of business expect the level of sales to be satisfactory or better; two-thirds of respondents expect investment to be the same or higher, with nearly 30 per cent expecting higher levels; and 70 per cent of businesses expect full-time employment to do the same. - So, in relation to the ACCI survey today, there were a number of indications that, in respect of their own businesses, businesses were expecting growth in either earnings or investment. It is true to say that, coming off record highs in January 2000, confidence is lower than it was at the time of the record high, but if you look at the measures of confidence, as I do carefully, the good thing to say about the ACCI survey is that the measures are certainly stronger than they were under the Labor Party government when the Labor Party was pushing Australia into the massive recession that it did in 1990 and 1991.In relation to the new tax system, because I am asked about the new tax system, can I just make this point: if the Labor Party were really against the new tax system and really opposed to GST, it would be pledging to abolish it. But the fact that the Labor Party on the one hand says that it is opposed the GST but on the other hand intends to keep it when it gets into government shows the complete hypocrisy of Labor Party spokesmen.The Prime Minister said on the weekend that this is the weakest Leader of the Opposition since Gough Whitlam. I would say - `and, unlike Gough Whitlam, who turned out to be Australia's worst Prime Minister, actually has a weaker policy position than Gough Whitlam'. The member for Hotham could be the weakest spokesman on Treasury matters for the Labor Party since his father. After five years he has not announced a single policy. On the one hand, he would have you believe that he is totally opposed to the GST; on the other hand, his desperate desire is to get into government and to take advantage of it.The Labor Party has been pretty lucky that it has had a sympathetic press for the last five years, but now that the focus is coming onto it and people are beginning to ask questions it is time for some answers to be given. And the biggest answer that the people of Australia want to know today is: if you are so opposed to GST, if you think it is no good for the economy, why are you not promising to repeal it? Why will you not commit yourself to a massive roll-back? Why will you not name the goods and services? Why will you not name how you will fund it? And, most of all, why will you not tell the people of Australia how much you intend to put up income taxes to pay for it?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I can inform her that the Australian Bureau of Statistics today released the retail trade figures for February showing a retail trade increase of 1.2 per cent for that month, coming on top of a 1.1 per cent increase in January. So retail trade is now 8.1 per cent higher than it was a year ago. The February outcome was significantly higher than market expectations and the increase in retail trade was broadly based: retailing and general retailing up 3.2 per cent, department stores up 1.9 per cent, recreational goods retailing up 1.5 per cent and food retailing up 1.4 per cent. By region, all states and territories recorded increases in February. That indicates that retailers are, I believe, taking not just advantage of good prices at the moment but advantages that have been given by cuts in income tax which came into effect on 1 July of last year and an accommodative monetary policy which has saved home mortgage buyers over $3,000 per annum on the average mortgage since this government came to office. We had a very interesting premiers conference here in Canberra on Friday of last week. All of the state Treasurers arrived here in Canberra - five of them Labor Treasurers. I got the opportunity to meet for the first time the Labor Treasurer of Victoria, Mr John Brumby, who made the following comment after the premiers conference, speaking on Melbourne ABC radio. Mr Brumby, a real Treasurer in a real government - albeit a Labor one. Mr John Brumby, the Labor Treasurer - and I would urge, on thinking members of the House, consideration of his words - said:I don't like people talking of recession. I don't like people talking the economy down. I don't think that is where we are at.That was on Friday afternoon. Have a guess who called the press around to a soccer match on Saturday to talk the Australian economy down? Who do you think would have thought it was so important to have the press at a soccer game so that he could talk down the Australian economy? Here is Brumby on Friday, basically laying the finger on the Leader of the Opposition and his henchmen, saying, `I don't like people talking the economy down. I don't think it is where we are at.' He could not resist for 24 hours. He had to get the press around to a soccer match in an absolutely irresponsible action. No ideas, no policy - just a desire to try and make false political capital out of talking the Australian economy down - and not nearly as responsible as Mr John Brumby, and that is saying something.</DOC>

 - The Youth Allowance policy has of course been one of the major and very positive initiatives of this government which has done away with the incentives that the Labor Party put in place for young people to drop out of school and go on to welfare. For years Labor gave young people the message that there was an alternative lifestyle available on the dole if they dropped out of school. That was what Labor's message to young people was. We introduced the youth allowance so that the incentives would be such as to encourage young people to invest in their own futures by continuing with their education and continuing to build up their skill levels. That is one of the reasons why we have seen a very significant fall in youth unemployment under this government - in fact, a halving of youth unemployment since the peaks reached under the Labor Party government. I am flattered that the member for Lilley believes that this is a matter in my portfolio, but I refer him to the fact, however, that Youth Allowance comes under the portfolio of Family and Community Services.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge that he represents a huge area of rural, regional and remote Australia. - He does it extremely well. I can say that, having spent some time with him in his own area, which is always a pleasure. Salinity is a national problem that requires a national approach based on very sound planning, cooperation and the deployment of real resources. It already affects around 2½ million hectares, or five per cent, of the cultivated land in Australia. Without action it is estimated that that figure will rise to around 30 per cent, a truly horrendous figure not just in environmental terms but in terms of the impact on the Australian economy and the impact, potentially, on a world which will increasingly become dependent on the capacity of countries like Australia to produce food and fibre in the future. The federal government is providing leadership on this very important question. We recognise that it is a challenge confronting Australian primary producers and the communities that they live in. Last year we announced a $1½ billion salinity action plan. It is a community led action plan or program, not a Canberra-knows-best solution imposed from on top. In addition to that, of course, we have deployed already $1½ billion or so through the Natural Heritage Trust. A great deal of that has been spent on land degradation and water quality. Again, that is a program that is led by communities acting in concert with sound advice, not a Canberra-knows-best approach.The community as a whole, it needs to be recognised, has benefited from primary production. We all eat and we all wear clothes. Many of our jobs, our exports and indeed our nation's wealth and our living standards are derived from the use of the land, and a lot of our rural and regional communities would simply close down if we do not deal properly with salinity and, importantly, as part of that help communities work through adjustment issues where they arise. When developing the salinity action plan, the government recognised the financial implications for farmers and their communities: very importantly indeed, we have written into the salinity action plan a clause that will ensure that loss of land-holders' rights are adequately addressed and adjustment assistance and, where necessary, compensation is paid.This is in stark contrast to the ALP's approach. They have dealt with environmental issues across this nation in the most divisive and destructive manner that any government could. They have constantly divided city from country, and if anyone wants an example of the price that country people have paid they need look only at the forest industries. We have the Leader of the Opposition saying on Cairns radio on 14 March:Labor will be putting caps on individual regions where there is major environmental damage or concerns of that nature.He goes on to talk about the Greens party being, interestingly, `significantly interested in what Labor have to say' before he moves on to talk about preferences with the Greens. He did not talk about engaging with the people who work the land. He did not talk about how he was going to work with farmers, the custodians, the managers, the producers from the land - the very people who in the end are the key to moving to sustainable land usage in this country where changes have to be made.Of course, you can always learn from their brethren, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, where continually Labor parties have shown their contempt for landowners, always willing to impact on landowners and their use of their resources, always ready to let that impact flow over into their communities without talking and working through proper studies of social and economic impacts and then making appropriate policy decisions. In relation to water, for example, the silence from Sydney is deafening, and then, in relation to land clearing in Queensland, what was the approach of the Beattie government to helping landowners cope with the unworkable solutions that he was putting up? A midnight fax through to us insisting on millions of dollars of Commonwealth money.So, in short, it is about time that the opposition developed a policy on sustainable land use which was not focused on the people of Paddington, Middle Park, Balmain, Northbridge or Manuka but, rather, went to the people of Griffith, Leeton, Narrandera, Albury, Wentworth, Mildura, Dubbo, Narrabri, Collarenebri, Gunnedah, Parkes, Forbes, Loxton, Berri, Biranbandi, St George - all communities made up of real people who are going to be impacted upon as we move towards sustainable production in this land. The coalition government has shown we can work in concert with those people; the ALP shows nothing but contempt for them. </DOC>

 - The question comes from a Leader of the Opposition who pushed youth unemployment in Australia up to record levels. In fact, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for education and for employment, youth unemployment reached its highest levels for decades. - The failure of the Leader of the Opposition, when he was responsible for this area of policy, devastated the lives of many young Australians. -  - It has a great deal to do with the question, because the question related to the impact of policies on the lives of young people. - You were the greatest failure, so far as young Australians were concerned, that this country has seen. So far as the report is concerned, the youth task force requested the government to provide them with an extension of time to prepare the report, which the government was perfectly willing to give. - The report has recently been submitted to the government. - The government is looking at the report -  - and will consider its handling of the report. - The report considers a whole range of matters concerning the opportunities for young people and the way in which government programs can help young people. Naturally, of course, that is why the government commissioned the report in the first place. It is a report which follows on from the Prime Minister's Youth Homelessness Taskforce. It is a report which will be very valuable to the government and will enable the government to put in place policies that will further assist young people.The hypocrisy of this question coming from the Leader of the Opposition is hard to believe, because nobody has done more damage to the lives of young people in this country than the person who pushed up youth unemployment to those record levels. The member for Hotham, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition sitting behind him, was responsible for that whole destructive merry-go-round of youth programs under the Working Nation program, which was solely designed to redefine long-term unemployment as short-term unemployment and to try to shorten the youth queues. This government has brought youth unemployment down dramatically. It has put into place programs, like the Jobs Pathway Program, which are this year helping some 65,000 young people to get jobs from school and which is having a very significant effect in raising retention rates at public schools around Australia. This government has also put in place the JPET program, which was terminated by the previous government and is designed to help homeless and very disadvantaged young people. There are now some 130 centres around Australia helping these very disadvantaged young people to take control of their lives once more. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, actually terminated that program, and yet it has been one of the most successful youth programs that this country has put in place.  - You terminated that program -  - and there was no substitute program put in place at all to compensate for the abolition of that program. As far as specific programs about the youth allowance are concerned, I suggest that you ask the relevant minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. I can inform him that on Friday six state and two territory treasurers came to Canberra for the second ministerial council on Commonwealth-state financial relations and, in particular, to allocate to each of the states their share of GST revenues. The GST revenues have been paid to the states in their entirety from 1 July 2000, and all revenue from GST goes to state governments. As an example, the state of New South Wales is budgeted to receive $7.9 billion of GST revenue in this financial year. Excluding specific purpose payments, the New South Wales government spends $4.2 billion on education. GST funds the salary of every teacher in every classroom in every school in New South Wales, and then it funds more. In addition to that, it funds public order and safety. Far from there being some kind of argument here in Canberra about the merits or demerits of GST, the argument that occurred here in Canberra was about who could get more of the GST revenues. Until then, I had never seen in all of my life a group of Labor state treasurers try to get their hands on a `filthy' stream of revenue that the Labor Party supposedly opposes. In all of the arguments on Friday about who would get more of the GST revenue, there was not one state treasurer who demanded that there be a roll-back. The one word that was never mentioned at the Commonwealth-state financial council on Friday was `roll-back'. There was not one state treasurer - not even the Labor Treasurer of Tasmania - who asked for a roll-back of the GST.I was very interested to come across a letter to the Australian on 31 March 2001 which was written by one of the members of this House. It starts off by saying this: Dennis Shanahan wants a touch of excitement in politics ... and a real political debate about Australia's future.I would have thought that Dennis is a very exciting chap - I am sure his wife and family think that he is a very exciting chap, too. The member continued:So do I ... - He has disappeared on more exciting business, pretty obviously. This member of parliament finished up, after calling for a touch of excitement in national politics, by saying this:... could the next big discussion be about the future of our national government and the redefinition of states' `rights' and responsibilities now that the GST has shifted so much to them?  - That letter was written by Cheryl Kernot, the member for Dickson. `Now that the GST has shifted so much to them' - in other words, now that you have fixed Commonwealth-state financial relations, can we get on with a debate about national responsibilities? I feel like saying to the member for Dickson: your policy is actually to roll back GST revenues. That is your policy - to take it away. If you roll back GST revenues, you are either going to take teachers out of school classrooms or policemen off the beat, or, if you are going to make up the revenues, you are going to have to find a new tax to guarantee those revenues. The real reason that the Labor Party cannot announce a policy on roll-back is that they do not want the Australian public to know how much they intend to put taxes up. You cannot guarantee the money to the states and roll back the GST.The New South Wales Treasurer, Mr Egan, had a press conference here in Canberra at the end of the Commonwealth-state financial ministers meeting. Have a listen to this. This is the Labor Treasurer of the largest state of Australia, who is committed by this Leader of the Opposition to the policy of roll-back. He was asked this question:Would rolling back the GST help your position? Egan: Well, let's wait and see what policies the political parties come up with before the federal election.Journalist: You are not exactly embracing roll-back, are you?Egan: Well, I don't know what the policy is yet.He does not know what the policy is, but he is not alone. The Leader of the Opposition does not know what the policy is, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not know what the policy is, the frontbench of the Labor Party does not know what the policy is and the backbench of the Labor Party does not know what the policy is. Most importantly, the people of Australia do not know what the policy is, and the Leader of the Opposition had better come out and announce it, because down in that fine print you will find that all roads lead to higher income taxes, and that is what he hides from the Australian public.</DOC>

 - It is extraordinary the crocodile tears that are being cried by the member for Lilley and by the Australian Labor Party. As another minister said in an earlier answer, the greatest travesty that you perpetrated on young people was record youth unemployment, the highest ever seen in this country. The other point, of course, is that you quite conveniently churned people through Working Nation. Apprenticeships were at the lowest level since the war when the ALP was last in government. The thing that we did for youth allowance that you never did was to make it available to many people in rural and remote Australia, and they now have access to rental assistance that they had never had. The previous policy of the Labor Party made it easier for people to go on unemployment benefits than it was to go on Austudy. What we did was introduce youth allowance where, as at the end of last year, there are now over 374,000 young people receiving youth allowance which is substantially more flexible with increased payments than Austudy.The government has received the report. We received it about a month ago and we will make an assessment of it. As far as the McClure report is concerned, it is this government that is tackling welfare dependency - something that you never ever did, because it was a policy of the Australian Labor Party almost to encourage welfare dependency to become intergenerational. This government wants to provide opportunities, and we have through a far more flexible job network provided opportunity in the sense of providing increased training and assistance, particularly to those people who are vulnerable within the community. As far as youth allowance is concerned, it has been extremely successful. I would just like to mention that 68,000 students are now receiving youth allowance and rental assistance that never would have received it under the previous policies of the Australian Labor Party. That is $52 a fortnight. There are 19,400 people in remote and rural parts of Australia who would never have received rental assistance but for the positive policies that we introduced for youth allowance. I totally reject these pious crocodile tears coming from the member for Lilley, who is the ultimate hypocrite. - If it offends you, Mr Speaker, I withdraw it. - I withdraw.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I also acknowledge the significant effort he puts into the whole debate about defence and the expertise that he brings to the issue. As detailed in the defence white paper, the government views the defence of Australia within a regional context, and it was the Prime Minister who said:  - The Prime Minister said:... while the self-reliant defence of Australia remains the basis of our defence policy -  - To finish the quote:... it is not the limit of that policy. Our security equally depends on developments in our neighbourhood and beyond.The fact that when the Howard government was elected in 1996 it immediately started the task of providing additional support to the Army was vindicated by the developments and successes which we have seen in the deployment to East Timor.I am asked if I am aware of any alternative approaches in this area. What I am aware of is basically confusion on all fronts from the opposition when it comes to defence policy. After a couple of weeks of questioning back in early March, the shadow minister told the West Australian that Labor's defence policy would not be decided until after the budget. So we were going to be told sometime in May. Then a few days later we were told:... although it will reveal how much money a Labor Government would allocate to defence in general, it will not tell voters what it will be spent on until after the election.That came from the opposition leader. Then on 13 March we had yet another story. This time the story was that the 1998 policy was now null and void. That was contradicted back in 2000, when the Leader of the Opposition was advocating two subs to the Adelaide Advertiser. Then yesterday there was just more confusion on top of that. The shadow minister, after having read a 30-page statement and discussion paper on defence policy, went on the personal attack and he said this memorable line. `Once again this is a furphy which the minister has been putting about. He suggests that we will not release policy details until after the election. No-one has said that,' said the shadow minister confidently. Isn't that incredible? Because only two weeks ago he said exactly those words. In his own words, he said: ... it is not appropriate for the Opposition to announce or speculate on specific defence equipment or force structure issues before the election.So he is accusing me of making the point that they are not going to announce a policy until after the election, and the shadow minister himself said so -  - No amount of loud interjections will overcome your problems of having put out a press release on 13 March which said that you are not going to tell us about your defence policy until after the next election. These people are just plain confused. They have no idea, and they are not prepared to be straight with the Australian public about their defence policy. Then you find that the shadow minister says, `I think it's shocking for the government to ask us questions about defence, because this breaks down bipartisanship.' That is what you said yesterday. In December, only three or four months ago, the very same shadow minister said:I am pleased to see that we have got a generally bipartisan position on the issue of defence. I am not so certain, however, that we share the same view about the force structure - That is exactly the point. The opposition will not tell the Australian people how they would spend the defence dollar, if ever the Labor Party were elected to office. I say, on behalf of the government and on behalf of anybody who is interested in defence issues -  - that, as the Leader of the Opposition was defence minister for years, he ought to at least be able to conjure up a policy for the next election and tell people where he stands. I will tell you why the shadow minister is a bit confused, it is because he is a bit worried. The reason he is a bit worried is that we now know that the Chief Opposition Whip is going to be the cabinet secretary. I will tell the shadow minister something that he will not acknowledge - that is, we know for a fact that he is not going to be the Defence minister if the Labor Party ever get in. He has got a lot of reason to be worried. No wonder he is confused. </DOC>

 - The first thing to say is that there is no hidden report. That is just absolute poppycock, as you would expect from the shadow minister. She talks about the Job Network, but I am afraid that, even though she actually has a Job Network provider in her own building, she knows very little about the processes nor the parts of the Job Network which constitute the job search training, intensive assistance and of course job matching. The facts are that the Job Network has provided 14 per cent better outcomes than the old Working Nation, at almost half the cost of Working Nation. The only thing that is on the public record is your comments when you were with the other party in the other place supporting failed programs under the Working Nation program. Job Network has been responsive to the market. It has over 2,000 different outlets where young people can actually access jobs. It also has IT, which allows for young people to be able to access any job in Australia from their own home, from libraries, from their schools or, in fact, from any Centrelink office.  - It is time that you learnt something about the Job Network and started to assist the unemployed of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware of a recent policy announcement from the member for Jagajaga, and honourable members will understand that these are so infrequent as to have some novelty value. The member for Jagajaga put out a press release last week saying that she intended to introduce a bill that would force doctors to do certain things. One of these is that she would make it a legal requirement for GPs who want to refer a patient to a specialist to refer the patient not to one specialist in that field but to three specialists. Let me focus on this for just a moment. - The member for Jagajaga has said that Labor will require doctors to normally provide three choices of specialist when referring patients. What does this mean in practice? Take Coonabarabran in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate. I asked the Health Insurance Commission to tell me what the options would be for a person who had a sick child in Coonabarabran, a city of 3,000 people -  - The nearest place to Coonabarabran that has three paediatricians is Sydney, but there are other options: Dubbo, Orange, Wellington and Bathurst. Dubbo is 150 kilometres away, Orange is 200 kilometres away, Wellington is 200 kilometres away and Bathurst is 270 kilometres away, but none of these has three specialists. It would be completely impractical. Someone in Ceduna would have to go to Adelaide, which is 500 kilometres away, to access three specialists and if they were not all available at the one time it would require three round trips. People in Charleville would have to go 700 kilometres to Toowoomba. This is a flight of fancy. The honourable member for Boothby understands, as I do, that the relationship between a doctor and their patient is one based on trust, not one which includes, when referral is necessary, referral to three people. How on earth does the Leader of the Opposition expect people to adequately choose between three microvascular neurosurgeons, even if you could find three of them in a capital city? How on earth does Labor imagine that something like this would be workable? It is completely unworkable for rural people, for imaging, for highly specialist procedures and for emergencies.Another worrying point of this is the cost of the policy. If you look at the fact that 35 per cent of specialists' consultations are initial consultations and if you took the assumption that two out of three people would consult the doctors to which they are given the options, the total cost of this policy as costed by my department is $452 million in a year. How is Labor going to pay $452 million? The nearest round amount that we can find is the Rural Health Strategy, something Labor has not once said that they would keep. Here we have it, a policy made on the run, a policy that is completely impractical, a policy that shows no understanding of the health care system, and a policy that would not apply to emergencies, rural people, imaging, or highly specialised procedures - a policy that shows what happens when you make policy on the run. </DOC>

 - The member raises some interesting questions, particularly about the breaching regime that is currently in place under the coalition government. The interesting thing for young people - indeed, for anybody - under the previous stewardship of the Australian Labor Party was that, if they were in breach, they lost their total entitlement. We introduced a gradual regime to ensure that we did not penalise people unfairly, which is exactly what the Australian Labor Party's policy did through the then Department of Social Security. Of those people who have lost their total payment under this government - and a lot of them could be young people, although we are very mindful of young people who are vulnerable, whether they are homeless, whether they have a disability or whether they are at risk - only 9,500 people lost that total entitlement for breaching. When Labor was in government that figure was around 80,000 to 90,000. It is just outrageous for the Australian Labor Party to show this affected compassion when the breaching regime that they had in place when they were in government was far more severe - indeed, you supported this legislation through the Senate. So what you say and what you do are two different things - and the Australian public knows that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question and, in particular, acknowledge her work as chairman of the government sugar industry task force. Along with the members for Hinkler, Page, Fairfax and Leichhardt, she put a great deal of enthusiasm into promoting the production of ethanol from sugar. They will be aware that I commissioned last year a review of the economics of the production of ethanol. Yesterday, I was very pleased to announce a project which takes the distribution of ethanol, and particularly ethanol-petrol mixes, a major step forward. The federal government, under its greenhouse gas abatement program, has offered BP Australia $8.8 million towards a $90 million project to help ensure that ethanol mixed with petrol is available through service stations in Brisbane and other parts of the east coast network.  The production of ethanol has significant advantages for Australia. Firstly, over five years this project will enable Australia to save about 1.1 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. Secondly, it makes our country a little less dependent upon OPEC and international oil prices and, thirdly, it has the potential to create significant jobs in rural and regional Australia as ethanol distilling establishments are provided and farmers gear up to the production of alternative fuels. It is certainly an industry with significant potential and, to have the support of one of the petrol majors, using its distribution network to supply petrol-ethanol mix, is certainly a major step forward for alternative energy production in Australia.This of course will not be the first production of ethanol in Australia. The Manildra Group, in the electorate of the honourable member for Gilmore, are major suppliers of ethanol. They produce about 32 million litres a year at the present time and distribute some of that by way of petrol-ethanol mix. That example can be followed by the grain industries and the sugar industries to provide enormous potential for the production of ethanol and the use of alternative fuels in Australia. BP will be required to source its ethanol from Australian producers, so this is a significant boost to Australian industry. I would like to commend all of those who have been associated with this project, and I note that the sugar industry in particular is looking forward to cooperative ventures to produce the ethanol and to boost many rural and regional economies in the sugar belt of Queensland and northern New South Wales.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair. I know he shows a very keen interest in social issues and particularly the proliferation of gambling. I inform members of the House of two very important articles published in the United States recently, which I hope might be taken on board by the Australian Labor Party. The first is an article by Gannett news service titled `Addiction risk high in Internet gambling'. In this article this organisation anticipates that gambling online in America will triple by 2004. This means that gambling will go to $6.3 billion by 2003, up from $651 million - almost a tenfold increase since 1998. The report also highlights the concerns of the American Psychiatric Association about young people who have access to credit cards and, particularly, that they are susceptible to the use of the Internet. Why? It is because that age group uses the Internet more than any other age group. The association said, and this is a very salient point, that there are many online video and broader gaming sites which are targeting children and teens, including links to gambling sites. We also know that 10 per cent to 15 per cent of these young people have reported significant gambling problems as a result of the Internet. Another survey in the New York Times news service was called `Betters find online gambling harder to resist'. This was a report by Pew Internet and American Life Project which also demonstrated that around five per cent of Internet users gamble; that is, 4.5 million Americans in total, with one million gambling every day on the Internet in the United States. It also stated that women and the less affluent were more vulnerable and were using the Internet, which is obviously a growing concern in the United States and is a growing concern for the government here. We do not want to see a proliferation in the accessibility of gambling, and the negative social consequences that it will have, particularly on the family structure and on crime. That is why a lot of surveys that have come out locally - indeed, from my department - illustrate that 68 per cent of Australians support the coalition's ban on interactive gambling. Is it any wonder; with interactive technology, with the use of the Internet and with the use of digital television, gambling problems will be exacerbated. Under this government, all the revenue from the GST will go back to the states. They do not need to encourage or increase the amount of gambling. We are drawing a line in the sand as we do not want to see -  - They might under roll-back, as the Treasurer said. This government wants to draw a line in the sand; we do not want to see interactive gaming happening in this country. That is why I call on the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, Bracks, Bacon and Beattie to follow suit with the Australian population, to ban interactive gambling and to start to come on board with the Liberal and National parties in addressing some of these major social issues. That is the responsibility that you should be taking here and in the Senate.</DOC>

 - It is not for me to give a running commentary on APRA. The reason why it is not for me to give a running commentary on APRA is that the focus of all the entities at the moment - that is, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Insurance Council of Australia and all state governments - should be on the interests of the policyholders. As APRA indicated over the weekend and I am happy to confirm, since October-November last year APRA has been working diligently with HIH to try to resolve any problems that might be associated with any changes in the financial state of HIH for policyholders. This has been a particularly important step because it has delivered to policyholders some substantial benefits. For example, the Allianz deal was announced in September 2000 and commenced on 1 January 2001. That deal between HIH and Allianz covers one million policyholders and has delivered on the fact that all of the following personal and domestic insurance policies, which were current -  - The Allianz deal, which APRA has approved, covers private motor, compulsory third party, private pleasure craft and home building and contents, and it has also sought to protect small business and rural and commercial insurance policies. Allianz paid out $45 million in the first two months of 2000, obviously as a direct result of the deal between HIH and Allianz. The second major deal involves NRMA and was announced on 14 March and came into force on 15 March. I remind the House that HIH went into provisional liquidation on 15 March. That covers 8,000 policyholders, covering workers compensation schemes. Then QBE, which is the third part of the deal to protect HIH policyholders, originally only covered anyone travelling on or after 17 March. That deal was announced on 6 March, came into force on 17 March and protected 750,000 policyholders who were travelling. All the efforts of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission are focused on protecting policyholders. I hope that the Labor Party supports that policy. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. Last year, when total employment grew by some 300,000, total union membership grew by just 23,000. I can inform the House that union membership has fallen in the past two decades from over one-half to under one-quarter of the Australian work force. Just under 20 per cent of the private sector work force are now members of trade unions; just under 50 per cent of the public sector work force are now members of trade unions. Even though fewer than 25 per cent of Australian workers are union members, 100 per cent of Labor members of parliament are union members. Nearly 60 per cent of the Leader of the Opposition's frontbench are not just union members; but former trade union officials.Because the unions control 60 per cent of the vote at Labor Party conferences, there are many safe Labor seats which are virtual rotten boroughs of the union movement. Between them, the Australian Workers Union and the Shop Assistants Union control more rotten boroughs than the Duke of Newcastle controlled before the 1832 reform act. This is why the member for Werriwa could point to members of the Leader of the Opposition's frontbench and say that they owe their positions entirely to Nepotism Inc.  - I appreciate that members of  Nepotism Inc. are not happy with this, but the fact is that, because the unions control the Labor Party, they completely and utterly dictate opposition policy. This is why members of the opposition are going to abolish Australian workplace agreements, abolish the Employment Advocate and turn contractors into employees. What members opposite want to do is to allow unions representing fewer than two million workers to completely determine the pay and conditions of nearly six million Australian workers. It is not right; it is not fair. If the Leader of the Opposition had any guts, any ticker, any integrity, he would cease being the ventriloquist's dummy of the ACTU, he would end the union bloc vote and he would remove the socialisation clause from the Labor Party platform.  - </DOC>

 - I would need to check that advice. I am happy to advise the House of a letter that I have received from Mr Graeme Thompson dated yesterday, 2 April. It says the following -  -  - Today is the 2nd. The letter says:I am writing in relation to the HIH issue that was raised with you in the House of Representatives question time ...I confirm APRA's advice to you on that day that neither the New South Wales Government nor the Motor Accidents Authority of New South Wales (MAA) advised or instructed APRA that it should appoint an inspector to the HIH Insurance group at any time. I also confirm our understanding that, under its legislation, the MAA has the power to appoint its own inspector to a compulsory third party insurer without receiving advice or approval from APRA.I confirm that the MAA - that is, in New South Wales - appointed an inspector to HIH on 6 March 2001, while APRA had issued its show cause notice regarding the appointment of an inspector on 1 March 2001. Our legislation requires us to issue a show cause notice with the company having 14 days to respond before we can appoint an inspector, but the MAA has no such obligation.For your further information, I have consulted APRA officers who were involved in discussions with the MAA about HIH in late October/early November 2000. Their clear recollection of those discussions is that:·	the MAA advised it was considering its options for the appointment of an inspector to HIH with regards to its motor vehicle compulsory third party business;·	the APRA officers advised that APRA was working closely with HIH on various questions about its financial position and was not, at that time, intending to appoint an inspector;·	APRA officers provided the MAA with APRA's latest assessment of HIH;·	MAA officers did not suggest that APRA itself should appoint an inspector;·	at no point did APRA argue that the MAA should not appoint an inspector because that would cause a loss of market confidence in HIH.The letter goes on to talk about Queensland's allegations:APRA's officers had several discussions with the MAIC - that is, in Queensland - about HIH's financial position, but they never expressed the view that all was well. The chief executive of APRA goes on to make a number of points, but I would just like to advise the House of the last two. -  - I will table it. He goes on to say:I also repeat that the vast majority of the HIH Group's policyholders are in a better position now, as a result of arrangements made with other insurers, than they would have been if APRA had appointed an inspector late in 2000. And I note that APRA staff have worked very hard in recent weeks and months to facilitate these arrangements.Finally, I assure you that APRA's supervision of HIH over past months has been totally aimed at protecting the position of the policyholders with this troubled company. We will continue to work with the provisional liquidator to achieve the best possible result for those policyholders who still have claims on the company.I am happy to table that letter. APRA's work is unfinished and therefore APRA deserves the opportunity to try to continue to protect the interests of policyholders without a running commentary from the sidelines. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Whilst the slowing -  - Whilst the slowing global economy poses challenges for Australian exporters, Australian exporters continue to do an outstanding job as far as Australia is concerned and as far as the strength of our economy is concerned. I would like to inform the House that the latest monthly trade figures show a substantial improvement in the balance of trade in February 2001 over the previous month. The balance of trade moved from a deficit of $89 million in January to a surplus of $389 million in February. Moreover, in trend terms, the balance of trade in February moved into surplus for the first time since August 1996. Exports rose three per cent in February, with rural exports jumping 15 per cent. That news this year in the month of February is unquestionably fantastic for the Australian economy. I am sure that the member for Corangamite very quickly put a press release out around his electorate, identifying the great job that the exporters from his electorate were doing. I might have missed something, but I have not seen one from the Australian Labor Party acknowledging these good results by Australia's exporters in February this year, because the Australian Labor Party are not interested in good news. They are not interested in talking up the Australian economy; they are only interested in talking the Australian economy down. While the Australian Labor Party are sitting around, wanting to slide back into office, our government is busy working with our exporters to deliver new market opportunities and to facilitate better opportunities for economic growth in our country and for Australia's exporters. Tomorrow I will outline the government's annual trade outcomes and objectives statement, which is our report card to the Australian people on our trade performance for the 12 months of the year 2000, and an outline of what we propose to do during the next 12 months. One of the more important trade policy tasks we are going to undertake is to strengthen the bilateral relationship with the new US administration later on this week. I will be travelling to the US to meet the new USTR, Bob Zoellick, to talk about issues revolving around the WTO later on this year, the ministerial APEC and the possibilities of a bilateral free trade agreement. The important point is that we have continued to work to strengthen economic circumstances in Australia to facilitate a better trading opportunity. We have embarked upon economic reform, which has strengthened the opportunity for Australia's exporters. We have embarked upon workplace relations reform, waterfront reform and taxation reform - all of which have undeniably strengthened the position of Australia's export industries. All reform projects that we have undertaken have been opposed at every turn by the Australian Labor Party. At the end of last week, we saw some good news for the Australian economy, good news for Australian exporters. To date, I have not seen an acknowledgment of that from the Australian Labor Party. </DOC>

 - I find the hypocrisy of questions being asked from the Labor Party about the supply of beds utterly astounding. This is from a Labor government that left us short of 10,000 places. That is not my estimate; it is the estimate of the Auditor-General who found that the Labor Party left us short of 10,000 places. Since I have been minister in this second Howard government, counting the 9,451 new places which I announced today - amounting to an additional expenditure of $182 million - we have issued nearly 32,000 places. Furthermore, we have put in place a trilogy of further reforms to bring them on stream. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that I have actually opened beds that were allocated by the Labor Party in 1991. In other words, there was never any accountability. And there are many more of those. Indeed, today I have received a letter from Minister Bronwyn Pike in Melbourne asking if she could please make a new arrangement that some of the high care beds that she has been holding be brought on stream. I have sent that forthwith to the department so that it can be agreed as soon as possible, because holding back beds has been a pattern of the Victorian Labor government.Now let me come to Mr Moran. Mr Moran - a good friend of yours no doubt - has given back 50 beds from the Northern Territory because he was not granted a capital grant of $2 million. In fact, the available capital to the Northern Territory went to those organisations who could not afford self-funding capital expenditure, such as the Uniting Church Frontier Services, who got $1 million, and other charitable and religious groups, including Aboriginal groups, that received another nearly million dollars. So we put that capital funding where it was needed. The other beds that were returned by the Moran group were ones where they failed to gain the `extra service' category, which meant that they could have charged bonds. That is the financial decision they have made.I have put in place today, with this announcement of this round, something very important, and that is the third in a trilogy of reforms into the timely release of bringing beds on stream. Firstly, we said that, if you are in receipt of those beds, you have got two years to bring them on stream - and, I might say, the Morans were not successful in bringing them in on time either. The second thing is that we now require people to make a six-monthly report as to precisely where they are at in bringing those beds on stream. Thirdly, and importantly with today's announcement, a key consideration in an applicant being successful will be whether or not they can bring those beds on stream in a relatively short time frame. The government have brought in reforms whereby we have put in place a benchmark of care in a framework of continuous improvement. We have put in place more beds, more money and better care. You can compare that with the record of the Labor Party, which was nothing short of shameful, with beds not being brought on stream in time at all - as I said, in 1991 they were still not on stream - in being 10,000 places short and in having substandard homes which they never visited or took care to see that they reached a standard. They never put in a standard that was legislated for. We have done that because we care for older Australians who need that care, as distinct from the hypocrisy of the Labor Party, which has the audacity to try and say that it has any plans at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie. As I think the House well knows, it has been this government's policy to run a balanced budget in times of economic growth and to repay the debt which was ratcheted up by the Labor Party in its last five miserable years of office. After coming into government, this government took a budget which was $10 billion in deficit and, over a two-year period, with $8 billion of savings, put it into surplus, and this year we will deliver the fourth surplus budget in a row. As we were doing that, we were opposed every step of the way by the Labor Party. The Labor Party not only had the budget in deficit but opposed all measures which were required to get it back into surplus. So you can imagine my surprise when a speech came across my desk the other day given by the Leader of the Opposition to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce where he had this to say:Our frontline commitment in fiscal policy for the next election is what we call the `golden rule'. - Yes, the golden rule is something that the Labor Party never observes when it has the capacity to do so. The golden rule apparently consists of two parts: first, governments must not borrow to finance current spending and, second, governments must save in the good times so that over the cycle the budget balances. Let us have a look at this proposition: governments must not borrow to finance current spending. Let us take the year 1994-95. The finance minister in 1994-95 was the honourable member for Brand. Let us test him against this proposition: governments must not borrow to finance current spending. In that year revenues were $109 billion and current spending was $123 billion. The government in that year borrowed 13 thousands of millions of dollars to finance current spending. - That is right. Let us check against the second limb of the golden rule: governments must save in the good times. Let us take a good time as a growth period of 4.5 per cent, for example, in 1994-95. Governments should save in the good times, so, according to the second limb of the golden rule, at a time of 4.5 per cent growth you should not just balance the budget; you should be saving. In the 1994-95 year, of the 4½ per cent growth rate not only did the then finance minister fail to save a dollar; he went out onto financial markets and borrowed $13.3 billion. In the 808 days when the now Leader of the Opposition was finance minister, have a guess how many days he observed the golden rule.  - Out of 808 days, how many days did the Leader of the Opposition observe the golden rule? - Any advance on 120? Sixty? Out of 808 days, the Leader of the Opposition observed the golden rule for precisely none, not one day. This golden rule attempts to take the public for a golden fool. You did not observe it on one single day, you have no capacity to carry it out, and it illustrates just why the Labor Party is ill equipped for government in this country.</DOC>

 - Of course, the member would know all about phantom beds because that is precisely what they announced. That is why the Auditor-General - not some spurious Labor Party committee that decides it will pick a figure out of the air, but the Auditor-General - when he audited the figures, was 10,000 places short. For that reason we have had to make up for that shortfall and provide for growth. The Labor Party in 1986 actually set the benchmark of having 100 places for each population of 1,000 people, 70 and above. Guess what? They never ever met the benchmark. In terms of allocations, we have met that benchmark and let me tell you, Mr Speaker: we brought on additional - importantly, community aged care - packages, because people want to stay at home as long as they can. For that reason we increased the number from 4,000, introduced by the previous Labor government, to 24,000 and by June 2001 we will have 24,000 community aged care packages on stream. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The formula was to have 40 high-care beds, 50 low-care beds and 10 community aged care packages, making 100 places for each of the communities I just described. The fact of the matter is that, to make up for the 10,000 places that Labor had left short, we brought on 14,000 places last year, which were announced in January; the successful candidates were announced in January. As part of the 2001 round, I have announced today 9,451, of which 2½ thousand are high-care beds, because we needed that to make up the ratio which was applied to account for the ageing population.We are doing our duty. We are the party that is providing what is required, as distinct from the Labor Party, who never did. I repeat that today I have put in place a third new rule, which is that, when these places are considered by the department for allocation, a key component will be how quickly they can bring those beds on. That will be an important component added to the six-monthly report and the two-year limit that people can hang on to it, as distinct from what the Labor Party did. I repeat that I am still opening beds that they allocated in 1991. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge that certain areas of his electorate are seeing very substantial growth, reflecting, amongst other things, strong local leadership. This government believes very strongly that, when rural communities and regional communities look to their future, the key ingredient above all else is that the solutions need to be local. You need to have local leadership driving local solutions. They are the hallmark of our approach. We are delivering them via a number of programs - and not least of all through sound economic management - such as Regional Solutions and rural transaction centres. This is in stark contrast to the ALP's approach, which is to impose solutions from on top, just the way they imposed members from on top, or, as the member for Werriwa would say, via the inside lane. An interesting illustration of the way in which we approach local communities and their needs is to be found in the small town of Mungindi, which I share with my good colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. One-third of it is on the Queensland side of the border and two-thirds is on the New South Wales side. I was out there during the last up week and we were talking with the local community about some of the economic and social issues that they have been confronting. They were without a doctor for quite a while and, thanks to the package that the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the government have put together, they have just attracted a new doctor to that single-doctor town. They acknowledge our role in that.After having been without a pharmacist for quite a period of time - the previous pharmacist who had been there for decades closed his shop up - with the assistance of the remote area package they now have two new pharmacists from Brisbane. They are a young couple looking forward to living their lives working in Mungindi, which is a great community. They are now looking forward to being able to use their own mobile phone. I had to speak with the Prime Minister over satellite phone from the main street of Mungindi. The next time I am out there, they will have a mobile phone coverage because, under Networking the Nation, they will have CDMA coverage. CDMA came about under our government after the previous government closed the analog network. They are looking for face-to-face banking and other services and, under the Rural Transaction Centre program, they are now designing a rural transaction centre which will give them a whole range of face-to-face services back in the community that urban Australians would take for granted. They are doing it under one of our programs. Under Roads to Recovery, they are replacing a missing bridge which has been gone for a couple of years. No-one at local government level had the capacity to put it back. It is now going back under Roads to Recovery. They are looking forward to having a decent road again between Mungindi and Boomi as it heads east towards Brisbane. I visited the local schools, and they have benefited from a range of federal government programs and what have you. Indeed, it was a very interesting illustration of how we can help a local community move forward. In addition to that, there is, of course, something they have not tapped into, the Regional Solutions program, which is also locally focused. There have been some 760 applicants from around Australia for that program, and a significant number of first-round programs out there are up and running. Success in the regions, as I said at the outset, really does depend in the first instance on locally found and locally developed answers. You cannot impose solutions from Canberra and expect them to work. Of course, Canberra imposed directives are exactly what regional Australia got from the ALP, and would get from any future Labor government. That, presumably, is what is behind Labor's national infrastructure council now proposed by the shadow spokesman. Presumably, that is what he means when he talks about regional coordination, because central control is what the ALP is all about. It does not believe in solutions from local people; it does not believe that local people might come up with answers that the Labor Party would be happy with. There is none of this grassroots democracy, as the member for Batman well knows. He knows how it works. It is a system that put him and most of his colleagues on the front bench over there. It is the system that, in the 1995 Labor preselection for the seat of Batman, allowed the national executive of the Labor Party to override the rank and file members of Batman and install the present member as its candidate. Indeed, as the member for Werriwa put it:Not surprisingly, given the way in which parliamentary careers were served to them on a plate, the Fergusons have become disconnected from reality.The member for Werriwa goes on to complain that no-one gave him such an inside lane. It is a system of centralised control that is still running very strong indeed, as the Labor Party faithful in the seat of Throsby have just discovered, with Jennie George being foisted upon them. So entrenched is this concept of centralised control in the Labor ethic that it is written into the party's rules - it is Labor law to override the wishes of a people of a region and to impose the decisions of head office upon them. That is not an approach that will ever work in rural and regional Australia - in stark contrast to the policy proposals under which we are able to work in partnership with rural communities to secure their futures.</DOC>

 - The way in which the planning is done and the way in which the allocation of places - both community aged care packages and beds - is made is that the number of places that the government will make available in one year are announced about this time of the year - March. Then the ACPACs - the Aged Care Planning Advisory Committees - meet, and there is one for each state. Those people meet together and look at the ABS statistics about what the growth will be for the particular region. They look at special needs groups, and I am delighted to say that, in the 2001 round, veterans will be classified as a special needs group. That was a decision I made last year, and it is an important one for veterans. They look at the special needs and then they make a recommendation to the department as to where those areas of need are. The department then makes a list of the targeted areas, which are published, usually about the beginning of June. They are advertised and people then apply. The department applies a set of criteria that is set out in both the Aged Care Act and the aged care principles as to which people can best serve the needs of the region of the people who need those places. Once a decision has been made by the department, they advise me of it and I then make the announcement as to who was successful. It is a very thorough, precise system of scrutiny of those people who apply. In the year 2000 round, there were 700 successful applicants, but there were 2,500 people who applied. The beds are allocated on the principle I outlined in the answer to the previous question. Indeed, brand new facilities are being built to meet the new certification requirements so that we will not have more than four people in any room and most people will have a single room with an ensuite. I have also said that in this current round a special requirement will be that a key indicator will be how quickly a provider can bring those places on stream.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. The Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce was established by the government in late September 1999 on the recommendation of the Youth Homelessness Taskforce. The government commissioned the report to see how government agencies, communities, state governments, businesses and schools could better work together to secure a successful transition from school to post-school life for young people and to make school more relevant to young people - the 70 per cent of students who are not seeking an academic career when they leave school. The consultations of the task force have been extensive and exhaustive and involved state governments, including of course Labor state governments, to ensure that the report is one which enables a fully comprehensive set of solutions to be put in place. - The member for Dickson has claimed that the report was 13 months overdue. The member for Lilley today called a doorstop and made the following statement:This report was delivered to the government last November, not in January as David Kemp has claimed.The truth of the matter was put on the record this morning by the chairman of the task force, Captain David Eldridge from the Salvation Army. Captain Eldridge was asked whether or not he had expected the report to be released before now. His answer was as follows:No, the report was not actually due 13 months ago.The member for Dickson might like to take that on board. He said:It was commissioned in September 1999 and initially it was going to be launched in March 2000. But about one month into our work, we realised that we really needed to undertake a much more extensive consultation and we asked for extended time. So we really completed it probably around November last year, and then with some editing and other issues gave it to the government in January.The member for Lilley said the report was delivered to the government last November, not in January. The chairman of the task force, Captain David Eldridge, said the report was given to the government in January. So is the member for Lilley calling the chairman of the task force a liar? This just shows you how far the Labor Party is prepared to go to distort the truth. But that is not the end of the matter, that is not the end of the distortions which have come from the other side of the House, because yesterday we had what Stuart Littlemore referred to last night as the `polyester outrage' of the Leader of the Opposition, alleging that the report made a direct link between the youth allowance and young people turning to theft or drugs. The Leader of the Opposition was very explicit in what he was alleging: I ask the Minister if he is aware that this leaked copy of the report states that some young people denied the youth allowance have `turned to petty theft or drug dealing to survive'.When you turn to the report itself, you do not find that link between the youth allowance and the reference in the report, which nobody could dispute, that marginalised young people indicate in some circumstances that they have turned to petty theft or drug dealing to survive. That is the problem that the government is seeking to address through the Youth Pathways report. What the report said was:These young people were young people who had run into problems at school - poor relationships with teachers or other students and inflexible learning arrangements. They told of being met with derogatory comments, sarcasm and threats of discipline. Some existing structures are not suitable for these young people and in rural and regional centres there are few alternative learning environments.Then the report says:Marginalised young people indicated that in some circumstances they had turned to petty theft or drug dealing to survive.The Leader of the Opposition attempted to make a completely inaccurate connection between young people turning to drugs and the youth allowance. The report is quite clear. Captain David Eldridge made it quite plain in his interview this morning that this report is about making sure that the school environment and other structures within which young people get support are adequate to meet their needs. These are needs that were never met during 13 years of Labor. As we remember the former member for Sydney said, `This was something we never did when we were in office.'This government has put in place the Jobs Pathway program, this government has put in place enterprise and career education and school to work programs which, under the Labor Party, provided assistance to some 25,000 young people and now provide assistance to some 167,000 young people. It is no wonder that youth unemployment has fallen dramatically under this government. What this demonstrates more than anything else is that the Labor Party is prepared to distort any information that may come into its hands in order to trade again a grubby political advantage. If you know the Labor Party, it is no wonder they have a copy of this report, because we have made no secret of this report. After their confected outrage yesterday, one may wonder why they release only six pages of it. Why are they sitting on the remainder of the report? Why don't they make the rest of it available?  - We are very concerned about young people who are being involved in dependence on handouts, but this is the first time we have seen an opposition party which is dependent on policy handouts. Obviously, what is going to happen is that the Labor Party is going to go away and suddenly release a policy to help young people based on the government's Youth Pathways report. We will find these recommendations reflected in Labor Party policy, just like the banking policy. The Labor Party is dependent on handouts from other people for its policy ideas. This government shows that it is serious by putting forward a full report that consults every element in this community to make sure that young people get the opportunities they deserve and the Labor Party, if it wishes to put this report out, can put this report out. </DOC>

 - I am very interested to see that a Tasmanian has to ask the question about Queensland. - And I would simply say I actually answered that question in the first question that I answered, and I repeat to you that the reason the Moran group handed back the beds in the letter that they wrote to the department was that they had not achieved extra service status which would have allowed them to have accommodation bonds instead of the accommodation charge. That was the reason they gave. Those beds will be reallocated so they are not lost.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I am proud to belong to a government which has enshrined freedom of association principles in the Workplace Relations Act. We are able to do this as a government because the coalition parties belong to their rank and file members. We are not owned by any outside organisation in the way the unions own and operate the Australian Labor Party. There are many good Labor people who are very concerned about the stranglehold which the unions have over the Australian Labor Party and which constitutes a permanent threat to freedom of association principles and true industrial democracy in Australia. The member for Fremantle, for instance, said:It is clear that unions ... exercise disproportionate influence through the 60:40 rule and through their affiliated membership, many of whom have no direct connection to the party. One vote, one value - the prime condition for a democracy - is not observed in the party's rules.That is from the member for Fremantle, a former Labor Premier of Western Australia, now a frontbencher condemning her own party. It is not just that the unions own and operate the Labor Party; they also bankroll its day-to-day operations and, what is more, individual unions have a specific claim over the loyalty of individual members of the Labor caucus. Amongst the $5 million which unions gave to the Labor Party last year, the Australian Workers Union gave $653,000 and, according to the Register of Members' Interests and information on the parliamentary web site, this union claims the specific affiliation of six members of caucus. The Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union not only gave $456,000 to the Labor Party last year but it owns and operates 13 members of caucus, including the Leader of the Opposition. The Australian Services Union not only gave $258,000 last year but it owns and operates 14 members of the Labor caucus. If these affiliations had no impact on policy, they might be of merely academic interest; but in health, education and economic policies Labor is dictated to by the ACTU. The former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, used to say, `If you can't govern yourselves, you can't govern the country.' A more appropriate statement today would be, `If you're not allowed to govern yourself, you should never be allowed to govern this country.' </DOC>

 - It would be an unusual day, wouldn't it, if the Labor Party did not take an opportunity to try to talk Australia down. They had a very bad day yesterday, because it was good news for Australia yesterday: retail trade was up; bad news for the Labor Party. So we did not have any economic questions yesterday. Of course, today, the Labor Party decide to get back to what is essentially their core business. After going out on Sunday to a soccer game -  -  - It was so important that he had to get the cameras down to a soccer game on Sunday to try to get his face up. Overnight movements on the currency markets were principally related to the release of a purchasing index in the United States which indicated that the US economy may in fact be growing faster than many people had expected. On overseas markets overnight there were movements in relation to many currencies, including the Kiwi dollar, which I think went below 40c, and the Canadian dollar - I think it was the member for Melbourne Ports who asked me about this - which closed at an all-time low at 63c. Not only are the fundamentals of the Australian economy not being reflected in the exchange rate; I think there is some truth in what is now believed to be the fact that the fundamentals of the US economy are not being reflected in relation to the US dollar. Through the course of 1998 and 1999, the US dollar strengthened on the back of strong US growth; through the course of 2000 and 2001, it strengthened on the back of weak US growth - that is, it became regarded as a safe haven currency, with huge capital inflows to the US economy. One of the consequences of that is that the US current account is now becoming larger than the Americans have experienced in recent years; conversely, one of the consequences for Australia is that the current account deficit is now much less than we have had in Australia for probably two decades, falling to about three per cent of GDP in the December quarter, unlike the figures of five and six per cent which have prevailed since the days of Mr Keating back in 1983.When the most recent trade figures came out, I also indicated that they showed a trade surplus for Australia - not just on the month, because you can have monthly trade surpluses, but, interestingly enough, on the trend. We have not seen Australia's trading position on goods and services in trend terms in a positive territory for probably decades. I may say in passing that a lot of the benefit of the improvement in prices as a result of the supercompetitive exchange rate is flowing to rural areas. There are a lot of people in rural Australia who are getting benefits in relation to commodity prices that they have never had before.  If the Labor Party wants to have a policy of affecting the exchange rate - and I say this honestly - if the Labor Party wants either to fix the exchange rate or, in relation to a floating exchange rate, to try for a revaluation, we are all ears to hear what its policies are. I ask this: is roll-back a policy now for the exchange rate?  - Is opposing Telstra's privatisation a policy for the exchange rate?  - Is driving the Australian budget into deficit a policy on the exchange rate?  - Is opposing the government's policy in relation to beer excises and taking $180 million out of the budget a policy on the exchange rate? Let me ask this question: does the Labor Party think that resocialising labour relations in this country is a policy on the exchange rate? Does the Labor Party think that regulating labour relations and abolishing AWAs is a policy on the exchange rate? Does the Labor Party believe that opposing competition in the economy is a policy on the exchange rate? I ask all of these questions to make one simple point: you are political opportunists, and the chief opportunist in this parliament is an ex-ACTU president, the member for Hotham. You will see political opportunists get out on a regular basis and try to make a cheap point, but you will never see them with a policy. When the press are next called to a soccer game for the chief opportunist in the opposition to make a comment in relation to the exchange rate, let them ask him this one question: if you are so concerned, which of your policies is directed to this issue? He would probably look at the soccer game and say, `Oh, no, another goal has been scored.' No policy, no serious position, five years of opposition and further from economic responsibility than ever before.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her ongoing interest in this matter. Payday lending is a form of finance where consumers borrow small amounts of cash and then pay it back when they next get paid, usually at astronomical interest rates. Taking an example that has been given to me from Queensland, one couple needed cash to pay off some small debts, so they went to a payday lender and borrowed $50 together with a flat fee. But the couple could not make the repayment and so rolled the loan over each fortnight together with the fee. Nine months later this couple owed the payday lender $980 - $980 on a $50 loan. In their case they ended up paying an interest rate of about 487 per cent. Sometimes the interest rate can be as high as 1,000 per cent per annum.There are around 80 payday lenders in Australia, and in a report to the Queensland Labor Minister for Fair Trading last August it was estimated that this could grow to 800 payday lenders within five years. The Australian Consumers Association and the Consumer Law Centre of Victoria have been calling for the states to protect consumers from extremely aggressive lending by payday lenders. The states have the power under the Uniform Consumer Credit Code to protect consumers from this insidious and exploitative practice. The rules under the Uniform Consumer Credit Code apply to bank lending, building society lending and credit union lending, and of course the banking code of practice applies to those as well.The government's argument has always been that there must be transparency for borrowers: they must have spelled out to them in detail the provisions of the loans and their obligations under those loans. Those needing payday loans are often the less prosperous people in our community. They are usually the less financially savvy, and they are sometimes the people who can least handle spiralling debt. They often obtain payday loans to cover short-term debts that have arisen because of gambling or other distressing situations. I took the opportunity when having a look at this to have a look at the Labor Party's policy. I just remind the House that the second paragraph of the Labor Party's policy stated: This policy is the result of several years of detailed research and policy work.That is, after they received a briefing from the ABA three days earlier - `several years of detailed research and policy work'! I looked at the provision relating to payday lending and I found one sentence. It reads:Labor will work with State Governments to bring pay-day lending and other short-term lending activities into the Uniform Credit Code. - What have I done? It is interesting. I was wondering where the Labor Party might have got this from. In fact, I looked through my records and found that last November I wrote to state consumer affairs ministers, including Labor state consumer affairs ministers, and I asked them, with their existing powers, to crack down on payday lending. Five months later most states are still not moving in any direction on payday lending. So if it was not - I am pretty humble about this - my policy they stole, I was wondering where the member for Hotham would have got the idea about following up on payday lending. It struck me last night when I was reading the newspaper and I had a look at this article that the member for Hotham must have gone and consulted the member for Watson, because there was speculation in the paper that all the Labor Party policies are, in fact, being road tested by the member for Watson. You can just imagine the member for Hotham going to the member for Watson and saying, `Payday lending,' and those puppy eyes of the member for Watson looking up a bit confused before he rolls onto his back saying, `Tickle my tummy.' Payday lending resonates in the community! - It is not enough to just have a word in a policy; you actually have to have a policy behind it. This government is calling on the states - and has been for five months - to move on payday lending. Today, New South Wales responded. It has taken five months for the government to convince New South Wales, because the Labor Party does not actually want to move on policy; it just wants to use the rhetoric.</DOC>

 - Let me first say that I welcome the question. -  - No, I do, because to get the Labor Party to focus on defence has been part and parcel of the questioning that I have made of the Labor Party in the last few weeks. The reason that I have been pursuing this question is that they have on the public record a statement that the Labor Party will not tell the Australian people about their policy until after the next election. I knew they were sensitive because of the bungles on the Collins class submarines - in fact, so sensitive that the Leader of the Opposition is now asking the questions himself. - The government's intentions have been laid out in the white paper. - I am sorry, I do not spend a lot of time on the web site - you may do - but we have a white paper. What is very interesting about this question is the sensitivity it reveals of the Leader of the Opposition: firstly, the fact that he bungled the Collins class submarines when he was the Minister for Defence and, secondly, that the Labor Party's public position is that they will not tell us what their intentions are when it comes to spending taxpayers' dollars, if the Labor Party are ever elected. In response to that, the Labor Party have been saying, `Isn't it shocking that the defence minister is playing politics, asking us questions about our policy?' - Behind the question there is a genuine issue, and the genuine issue is that we have stated, as the government, what we intend to purchase with the taxpayers' dollars over the next 10 years. We have spelled out what it is that we believe is necessary for the defence of this country. In pursuit of the Labor Party's policy -  -  - You should not be looking at our web site; you ought to be preparing a policy. You ought to be responding to the clear public and national interest for the Labor Party to tell everyone what their intentions are. These are the people who, when the shadow minister -  - Mr Speaker -  - I conclude on the simple point: the fact is the government has -  - I was just getting out the quote, as a matter of fact. It was a quote made in December. The shadow minister said that it was good to have a bipartisan position, but he also said:I am not so certain, however, that we share the same view about the force structure ...The question of submarine purchases is a question of force structure. The simple point that I have been attempting to make is that there is a difference of opinion and approach to the basic question of force structure. The government have settled their approach. We have a clear position, it is spelt out in the defence white paper and we back that up with dollars. The fact is that, despite the amusement on your side as to what may or may not be on some web site, the government's position is in the government's white paper. It is a serious issue, and the sensitivity that you show on this reveals -  -  I know exactly what the white paper means, and I know that you have not explained to the Australian people what Labor is going to do if Labor is ever elected. It is not good enough to hide behind a declaration that we will see no such statement from you until after the next election.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. The Howard government has lifted federal support for schooling to the highest level ever for a federal government for both public government schools and for non-government schools. I am, however, aware of plans to cut the funding of certain schools, and these are plans announced by the Leader of the Opposition, because the Leader of the Opposition has informed us that he intends to cut the funding of a number of low fee community based schools and the funding of schools serving school communities of moderate income. He has also told us that he is going to introduce again Labor's iniquitous new schools policy - so low income communities will not be able to afford a school of their own any longer.The Leader of the Opposition is planning, for example, to cut some $3,375 per student from the Warwick School of Total Education, a community based school in the Darling Downs, but he is only going to take $178 a student away from Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore). He is going to cut $1,603 per student from the Woodleigh Primary School in the election of Dunkley but, compared with that, he is only going to take $192 away from Knox Grammar. He is going to take $2,020 per student away from Mentone Girls Grammar in the electorate of Isaacs, a school serving a diverse community, a school directly comparable to many schools which will lose nothing, but only $20 per student away from SCEGGS Redlands and he is not going to take anything at all away from St Ignatius Riverview, Loretto, Pymble, Wenona, Masada or Queenwood. It is the poorer school communities that the Leader of the Opposition is targeting. Why is he doing this? He is doing it because he needs to treat these school communities vindictively, because he needs scapegoats to appease the Australian Education Union, whose policy is for no funding for non-government schools. These are community schools serving moderate income and low income communities - low income communities that will never have their own school because Labor will reintroduce the new schools policy. These are the scapegoat schools. These are the scapegoat school communities that the Leader of the Opposition needs because he has to appease the Australian Education Union, which does not want any funding for non-government schools.The Leader of the Opposition should not think that this disgraceful and irrational policy is going to be a low cost policy for him because we are going to make sure that the parents in Jagajaga, Melbourne Ports, Dunkley, Chisholm, Macarthur, Gilmore, Adelaide and other electorates know the full consequences for them of a Beazley victory in a federal election. This government is going to continue to fight for justice in school funding and expose the injustices and inequities of the Labor Party's school funding policy.</DOC>

 - John Prescott was asked by my predecessor to look at industry issues in respect of shipbuilding. He undertook some work over a period of time and he provided a written response to the minister, John Moore, prior to my being appointed - in fact, prior to the announcement of my appointment. That was in the second half of last year. He has at some time been appointed as the chairman of ASC, the Australian Submarine Corporation, and, as I understand it, the report has been prepared in the context of the future of ASC. In that context he has provided some comments about the future of naval shipbuilding in Australia. The department has been charged with having discussions with industry on the future of shipbuilding in Australia, and the report prepared commercial in confidence by John Prescott has been part and parcel of the department's discussions.I have had some discussions with John Prescott, not specifically referring to or having any relation to the document that he prepared, I must say, but talking about the future of shipbuilding in Australia. His view expressed to me was that, whilst the government's clear outline is set out in the white paper, he expected many of the decisions about the future of the industry to be made by commercial players responsible for their own assets and their own businesses. Given that he said that to me privately, I am sure he would not mind my saying it to you publicly. Therefore, the claim that he has recommended, or that he sees that it is the government's responsibility to propose, necessarily, the abolition of jobs, as you put it, is simply out of context and certainly not the way in which the matter has been discussed with me.In terms of the future of naval shipbuilding, from time to time it does become an issue, and obviously the purchases that governments make are important. For example, back in 1989 the then defence minister, a Mr Kim Beazley, announced in a press release on 14 August 1989 with regard to the Anzac frigates: Five of the 12 ships will be assembled and launched in Newcastle. This and other work on the ships will give Newcastle industry $200 million of direct work and create 1200 new jobs.The previous government - and this is a classic case - went around Australia making all sorts of promises about defence, one of which was promising people of Newcastle that five ships would actually be launched in Newcastle as a result of the purchase of frigates. As all Australians now know, 10 of them have been built in Melbourne. This is just another case of the bungling of naval capability acquisitions by the previous minister, which reveals again the paucity of constructive comment by the Labor Party on this issue. - I beg your pardon? - To respond to the interjection -  - The outdated document that they have was prepared back before 1999. Typical of the Labor Party, they churn up stuff which does not represent the government's position - trying to pass it off in the Australian parliament as a current document. It just shows you how fraudulent some people are. It should be tabled again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I know he takes a keen interest in small business, not only in his electorate but in Victoria. Small business is the engine room of Australia's economy, and this government works hard to ensure that small business has a regime of low interest rates and low inflation. I know the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for small business, agrees that that is an important part of ensuring that small business succeeds - but unfortunately the Labor Party's rhetoric on their policies towards small business is shown up by the Victorian Labor government in their latest move to introduce changes to the land tax system. What is happening in Victoria right now gives small business right around Australia a real opportunity to see what happens when the Labor Party gets into power. The Victorian government of Mr Bracks, Mr Brumby and Ms Thomson have proposed a system that is really going to make small business pay, and pay hard. They are introducing a system where there will be an abolition of the tax free threshold of $85,000, to be replaced with a progressive system with a flat rate of 2.89 per cent for all business properties. The owner of a hotel on a piece of land valued at $243,000 in Traralgon in the seat of McMillan currently pays $213 - a reasonable amount. What are they going to pay under Labor? They are going to pay 25 times that amount. -  - No, I am not exaggerating these figures. They will now -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I can only agree with your ruling. If a hotel in Traralgon is not a small business, then I do not know what is. I will go back to the figure. They are currently paying $213. Under the Labor Party in Victoria they are going to be asked to pay $5,970 - an increase of more than $5,700. The brilliance of the cunning plan of the Labor Party in Victoria is that, under the new system, a hotel in the member for McMillan's seat will pay land tax at the same rate as a multinational in Collins Street. Labor do not understand small business; they are about higher interest rates, higher taxes and higher government debt. I would suggest to the member for Wills - another member of the Labor dynasty; the Thomson Labor dynasty - and the member for Hunter that they should actually include this issue in the sham of an inquiry that they are having around Australia on small business. I suggest to the member for Wills that he should have a chat to the minister for small business in Victoria, Ms Thomson, and suggest to her that, if she is fair dinkum about small business in Victoria, she will pull this piece of tax grab from the Victorian government.</DOC>

 - The reason we are doing it the way we are is that we think that is the best value for money. In terms of the impact on Australian business, the value of work in Australia is estimated to be around $400 million and Australian industry will be involved in design and development of radar and electronic warfare systems components, radar component manufacture, testing and ongoing support of the new aircraft. We also have an option for three additional aircraft. If that option were to be exercised -   - we would obviously have a different situation to assess and we would relook at that issue of further production here in Australia. While I understand the interests that the member is pursuing in terms of jobs in his own electorate, the fact is that these things have a cost attached to them and, if you want to look at doing it a different way, then you will need to find the additional dollars to pay for it. Given that the Labor Party cannot tell us what they can afford to pay for if ever they are elected, because they are not prepared to tell us what they are prepared to do, then you are not in a very strong position.When the best that the Labor Party can do is pull out an extract from a web site which is at least two if not three years old as the basis for asking questions in the national parliament about the future of defence spending, then you have a frontbench that is completely bankrupt of any ideas about defence and has the incredible arrogance and gall to tell the Australian people that it will not tell us until after the next election. - I have finished, Mr Speaker.

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. He has asked a question on a subject in which he has had a longstanding interest. Australian businesses and consumers have for far too long paid too much for their books, computer software, computer games and CDs, and that is why the government has taken steps to bring prices down. In 1998 the government opened up the CD market, resulting in lower CD prices for Australian consumers. The result was a significant drop in prices. For example, top 40 CDs that were once selling for around $30 or more now sell in Target and other discount stores for $21. Earlier this year we introduced amendments to the Copyright Act that will remove parallel importation restrictions on computer software, and that will relate to computer games, console games and CD-ROMs, and in relation to books, and that will cover sheet music and periodicals as well. Today the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission issued a report which found that, whilst prices for CDs have been heading down since August 1998, Australians continue to pay higher prices for books and computer software - higher prices than their overseas counterparts. The ACCC found that the importation provisions in the Copyright Act restrict competition to the detriment of consumers by granting an import monopoly to copyright holders. What they said about software is this: the last spot price comparisons show that, despite recent falls in the value of the Australian dollar, Australians are still paying around 12 per cent more on average for leading business software than their US counterparts. In relation to computer games, the ACCC said that devotees of popular PC games pay around 20 per cent more than those in the UK and five per cent more than New Zealand players. Of course, these higher prices are borne by somebody; they are borne by Australian consumers and by Australian small business and industry, such as the domestic software industry.Why should we pay higher prices? Under the government's parallel importation amendments, small business will benefit from lower prices. They will get increased access to popular applications for word processing, database management and graphical analysis. In relation to books, the ACCC found this: on average, Australians paid around 44 per cent more for fiction paperbacks than United States readers did in the 12½ years from July 1988 to December 2000. During the same period, Australians paid around nine per cent more than United Kingdom readers for best-selling paperback fiction. The ACCC's report suggests that there are significant gains to be made once we lift the restriction on parallel importation of books and software.  The member for Sturt referred to alternative policy approaches. The question is whether Labor will support change so that Australian businesses and consumers do not continue to pay higher prices for tools that are essential in the knowledge nation. Under Labor's 30- and 90-day `use it or lose it' plan, Labor will continue to line up with the multinationals. Under Labor's plan, parallel import rules will maintain the monopoly profits of the distribution cartels. In August last year the then shadow minister for industry and technology even acknowledged that Labor is not interested in the interests of consumers of packaged software. What the shadow minister said on Sky News was this:The Government is moving towards a policy - they've announced a policy; we'll see the legislation soon, I assume, that will take away the rights of the creators and try to just drive down the prices. It's entirely driven by consumer interest.The Howard government is interested in consumer interests. Labor interests would only make consumers big losers, and under Labor policies they would have less choice and would have to pay more for books, magazines, CDs and computer software.</DOC>

 - I take it that the shadow Treasurer is now saying that the GST has led to interest rate cuts. He says, `When are you going to admit the obvious? It is the GST.' The reason I find that humorous is that, throughout the course of last year, the Labor Party attacked GST on the grounds that it would cause interest rates to rise. The Labor Party says that the GST causes the sun to rise and, if it does not, it causes the sun to fall. Here is what Simon Crean said on 26 July 2000:Higher inflation and rising interest rates are the handiwork of the Howard-Costello GST obsession.So last year the GST was going to put interest rates up. Here is what Kim Beazley said on 2 August 2000:These interest rate rises along with their predecessors have one set of vital origins - GST.Today the opposition get up and say, `Will you now admit that the GST has caused interest rates to fall?' They spent all of last year walking to the dispatch box saying, `Will you admit the GST has caused interest rates to rise?' and they have spent all of this year walking to the dispatch box and saying, `Will you admit the GST has caused interest rates to fall?' It is just an extraordinary position. The Labor Party have one mantra: if the US economy goes into recession, it must be the Australian GST; if the Japanese economy is weak, it must be the GST; the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the UK must be caused by the GST. Was there an earthquake in Equador? That was the GST too. If it was not an earthquake, it must have been a flood.What I do not understand is this: if GST slows an economy, presumably you would abolish GST in order to get a boost to the economy. If that is the effect, you would have a policy, would you not, of abolishing GST so that you would get a huge boost. But the opposition do not even take that position. This is a position where a group of people who have no economic ideas first come out and blame the GST for X and then say, `If it did not cause X, it caused the absolute opposite of X. But, in any event, we would like to keep the GST because the last thing we would want to do is actually get into office and do something responsible.' And guess what? The worst spokesman on Treasury matters, the biggest opportunist, the least credible spokesman, is a former president of the ACTU.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. I can inform the House that this morning the Reserve Bank of Australia cut the official interest rate by 0.5 of a per cent - by 50 basis points. The Australian banks are moving to pass that reduction in interest rates on to home loan borrowers. After you pass on that full 50 basis points cut to home loan borrowers, the standard variable mortgage interest rate should fall to around 6.8 per cent. For an average Australian family with a $100,000 mortgage, today's interest rate cut will save them about $40 a month in interest costs.If you look at the difference between the home mortgage interest rate today and the rate when this government was elected - 10½ per cent - today the average Australian with a mortgage of $100,000 saves $300 per month in interest costs as a result of this government's program. That is a full saving of $3,700 a year of after-tax money. The average family on the average mortgage saves $3,700 a year as a result of an interest rate which is now 6.8 per cent, rather than Labor's 10½ per cent of five years ago.I thought that both sides of the House would probably be interested to know how today's benchmark 6.8 per cent interest rate compares with the Labor Party's high of 17 per cent back around the beginning of the last decade - the 1990s. The saving on today's mortgage interest rate of 6.8 per cent, as compared with Labor's peak of 17 per cent, is $10,200 on a $100,000 mortgage. Today the average Australian is saving $10,200 a year just in their mortgage interest payments as compared with their payments under the interest rate regime which peaked under the Labor Party. That is after-tax money so, if you assume you are on a top marginal income tax rate, that is $20,000 of pre-tax income you are saving. It is the family's second job. During the Labor period, of course, it was hard for a family to get its first job, but if they were able to get a second job the whole of the second job would have been eaten up in those high interest rates. In addition to that, the small business overdraft rate has come down. It should now be at a benchmark of 7.95 per cent compared with 11.25 per cent when this government was elected.  A low interest rate regime which is consistent with low inflation is good for home buyers and it is good for small business. For those home buyers who want to take advantage of these very low interest rates - they are now about 6.8 per cent - there is also the opportunity, if you are a first home buyer, to get a $14,000 grant for your home. There has never been a better time for young couples to buy their first home. We have a $14,000 grant and an interest rate of 6.8 per cent - an opportunity to keep the bills down, and that is good for home buyers and good for small business.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for McPherson for her very important question. As the Treasurer advised the House a little earlier, the Reserve Bank has today acted in the markets to cut interest rates by half of one per cent, which represents a saving for the average Australian home borrower of around $308 a month - $3,700 a year - in after-tax money as compared with when the Labor Party was last in government in 1996. Most banks have moved quickly to pass on the benefits. Westpac will deliver the full 0.5 per cent cut on mortgage and business loans in seven days. The Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Wizard are also moving next week. Others are too slow, such as the National Australia Bank, which is taking 19 days to deliver the half a per cent cut. This is, of course, still much faster than the timing of the cut delivered under the Labor Party.When there was an interest rate cut when the Labor Party was last in government, it took 51 days for the banks to pass that through to their customers. The average today is around seven days and it stretches out to 19 days. Mr Speaker, it goes one step further: today, the banking competition policy has delivered real results to consumers. As an example of that, today one mortgage originator announced a 30-year variable rate home loan of 5.64 per cent for loans of $100,000. Even with the application fee of $760, the rate announced today of 5.64 per cent is the lowest variable home loan rate ever in Australia. The benefits of competition are delivered directly to two million Australians who have a variable home loan rate. A further 35,000 new loans are approved every month. Home loan rate movements have a major and immediate impact in Australia, where 75 per cent of all home loans are at a variable rate. Therefore, variable rate movements flow through to consumers in Australia much faster than, say, in the United States, where around 80 per cent of all loans are fixed term - 30-year fixed term rates. Under the Labor Party in 1996, a couple with a $100,000 loan buying a home in, say, Robina in the electorate of McPherson would have been $308 a month worse off - and that is in after tax money. In Glenmore Park in the electorate of Lindsay, there is a development of 2,000 homes. The average home loan would be around $100,000 and those people in those 2,000 homes in Lindsay will be at least $308 a month better off under the coalition than under Labor. In Greenwood Estate in the electorate of Herbert, the average home loan is around $125,000 and consumers will be more than $300 a month better off under the coalition. At North Lakes in the electorate of Petrie, there are now 128 homes and, over the next 15 years, a further 8,000 homes will be built for 25,000 people. Those people are going to get the benefits of lower home rates. Mr Speaker, $308 a month delivers real benefits to Australians with home loans. Under the Labor Party they were $308 a month worse off, because of the Labor Party's policies. If you can give anything to small businesses and families, where there is $28,000 a year of household income, an interest rate cut of $308 a month after tax would be a very real benefit, and it is delivered by the Howard government. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, seeing as I launched that statement a couple of months ago - I think it was 29 January - I will have to go and look at the documentation. I do not, of course, accept for a moment the claim made by the shadow minister opposite that I have misled the Australian public, but I am glad the member for Dobell has allowed me to say something about the enrolment benchmark adjustment. If we are talking about misleading comments, the only misleading comments about the enrolment benchmark adjustment have come from the Australian Labor Party, and most particularly from the member for Dobell. The enrolment benchmark adjustment recognised that, if there were fewer children being educated in government schools, the cost of educating those children would fall.The enrolment benchmark adjustment did not seek to transfer from government schools to independent schools. The claim made by the Australian Labor Party that the enrolment benchmark adjustment sought to shift money from government schools into independent schools is completely false, and you know it. You have misled, systematically, the government schools of Australia on this issue. That money was never transferred into independent schools. It represented a diminution of the payment made by the federal government to the state government because of the cost. Quite separately from that enrolment benchmark adjustment, the coalition has increased, at a faster rate than state governments, its contribution to financing public sector education in this country. It is very interesting that the member for Dobell comes from a seat in the state of New South Wales because, in the current financial year, the percentage increase in federal government spending on government schools in New South Wales has risen at a faster rate than state government spending on government schools in New South Wales.  - I am so pleased he has raised it -  - This is despite the fact that the member for Dobell and the Leader of the Opposition both know that the primary responsibility for government schools is carried by state governments. They are state government schools; they are not federal government schools. Something like 88 per cent of the cost of running state government schools is borne by state governments yet, despite their predominant financial responsibility, in both New South Wales and Queensland Labor governments have increased their spending on government schools at a slower rate than has the federal government. This is despite the fact that we, in effect, discharge - this has been historically the case under both Liberal and Labor governments - what is only a supplementary financial responsibility for government schools. Let me say that the policy of this government is to boost and support the choice of parents in education. As somebody who has benefited from a very fine public education system in New South Wales, let me say very clearly that we remain strong supporters of public education in New South Wales and in all the other states. In relation to the enrolment benchmark adjustment, what we have said is that that money that would otherwise have been returned will not be returned if the state education systems agree to spend that money on additional science and maths teachers and on other things related to science and mathematics. That represents another injection of money by the federal government into government schools. It is about time that the Labor premiers of New South Wales and Queensland were shamed into putting a greater percentage of resources into the government schools for which they are primarily responsible</DOC>

 - I take this opportunity to wish the Prime Minister happy anniversary - it is 30 years, which is certainly something worth noting. I would like to thank the member for Fadden for his question. I know he takes a keen interest in and regularly talks to small business in his electorate. Small business today received some welcome news - a 0.5 per cent cut in the interest rate. This comes on top of a 0.25 per cent cut in February and a 0.5 per cent cut in March. - . I will come to him in a minute. If we want to get these cuts into perspective, we need to compare current interest rates with those interest rates that existed under Labor. When we turfed them out in 1996, official interest rates were 11.25 per cent. Today, they stand at 7.95 per cent. I join with the -  - Jenny Craig will do! I join with the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation in urging banks to pass on these cuts immediately to small business. For a small business with a $100,000 overdraft, a cut in interest rates - in comparison to Labor, from 11.25 per cent to 7.95 per cent - is a saving per annum of $3,300. As I said, the member for Hunter actually agrees. He said that the most effective way to help small business is to have low interest rates - and that is what this government is delivering. Why then was it the case when Labor was in power, with the world's greatest Treasurer - the member for Higgins has a smile on his face - that when I was farming in the South Burnett, a struggling peanut and grain farmer, I was paying 22 per cent? Official interest rates at that stage were 20.5 per cent. If we compare that for a business with a loan of $100,000 paying the official interest rate of 20.5 per cent as against today's rate of 7.95 per cent, small businesses in that situation are saving over $12,000 per year in interest: $1,000 a month, $250 a week is being saved by small business as a direct result of the good management of this economy by our government.</DOC>

 -  As of today, the number of confirmed cases of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom has reached 990 and there are now reports that that number will grow to around 4,000 within a couple of months. It is clear that the epidemic has not peaked as yet and that the problem is certainly pervading every aspect of life in the United Kingdom. Around a million animals have been identified for slaughter and about two-thirds of those have so far been slaughtered, but there are hundreds of thousands of carcasses that are yet to be disposed of. There are particular concerns in the UK as to whether there is a sufficient number of vets to be able to manage this tragic situation, which of course is traumatic for all of the people involved. Australia is putting together a further contingent of vets to take the place of the group of 25 vets and stock inspectors who have been there since early in the outbreak.At this stage, the outbreak seems to be confined in Europe. There are still only two confirmed cases in France and 11 in the Netherlands - although there are some reports this morning of some additional cases in the Netherlands. This outbreak is affecting all aspects of life in the UK. Not only has it cost them already an estimated 12 billion but it also affects travel and tourism; as well, local elections have been deferred and the six-nations rugby games have been postponed until next year. It is clearly a major disaster and one that the whole of the world is watching with a great deal of sympathy and concern.At the local level, Australia remains vigilant. We have substantially increased our efforts at borders, both at airports and seaports. Around 23,000 additional passengers each week are being processed through red channels especially for FMD risk. Around 700 passengers each day are having footwear and other equipment scrubbed. That sometimes causes delay, particularly as happened in Sydney earlier this week when a whole football team arrived from France with dirty football boots, and in Adelaide when a cricket team arrived from the UK with a lot of cricket material that had not been cleaned. Those delays are, I think, being understood by the travelling public. We have been impressed by the number of people who have actually come forward and said, `I've been on a farm and please inspect my luggage.' I think that positive approach is certainly helping Australia to address these sorts of issues. I would like to compliment the freight industry in Australia which is also enduring considerable delays. There is 100 per cent inspection these days of containers and that is costing the freight industry quite a deal. We appreciate very much their consideration in that regard. Last week, I reported to the House suggestions that there was foot-and-mouth disease in East Timor. I dispatched a senior Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service officer to discuss the situation with United Nations personnel in East Timor. I am pleased to report back to the House that Sergio Vieira de Mello, the special representative of the United Nations, has confirmed that there is no evidence to indicate the presence of foot-and-mouth disease in East Timor. That advice is certainly confirmed by our own veterinary officers in East Timor. We have also been concerned about reports that food products were coming into East Timor from countries which were not free of foot-and-mouth disease. I am delighted also to report to the House that the United Nations has acted promptly on Australia's concerns. A directive has now been issued, banning all animal products of European origin and also all meat products, dairy products and other animal products from countries not specified as free of FMD. They will remain prohibited until further notice. I commend the United Nations on taking responsibility for maintaining East Timor's foot-and-mouth-disease-free status. That is important also for Australia because it helps to maintain a buffer of foot-and-mouth-disease-free countries around our borders. This is a major issue on which Australian authorities are working hard and cooperatively together. I commend Quarantine and Customs staff, the workers at airports and seaports, and the people involved in the freight and shipping industries for their cooperation in meeting this challenge.</DOC>

 - It may come as a surprise to the member for Dobell, but I do not have an ear cocked every day at every hour to the proceedings of the Senate estimates committees. When I was asked -  -  - When I was asked a question a moment ago by the member for Dobell, I said I would check the documentation. I intend to do that. I will do that. If he wants to ask me a series of other questions, he is welcome to do so. There has been absolutely no attempt by this government to disguise the fact that we are providing additional resources to government schools. This is not only in New South Wales - although, because of the way in which the enrolment benchmark adjustment has been triggered, the greatest beneficiary of this policy of ours will happen to be the state of New South Wales, because it has been in the state of New South Wales where the numbers in government schools have diminished, perhaps due to the policies followed by the Carr-Aquilina government in relation to government education in that state.  - He is the education minister, Michael, in case you did not know. I will certainly be checking the documentation, but can I just take the opportunity of saying again that in relative terms -  - this government has been more generous to government schools -  - not only in New South Wales but all around Australia. They have been the governments primarily responsible for government schools. I would say again to the member for Dobell: why don't you talk to your factional friend the New South Wales Premier and remind him that, if he had increased spending on government schools by the same percentage as we have increased spending on government schools over the last 12 months, all of those government schools in electorates like yours - and great government schools like the Earlwood Public School and Canterbury Boys High School, both of which are in the electorate of the member for Watson - would have had even more resources? Instead of trying to lecture us about support for government schools, you ought to talk to the Labor government of New South Wales, the Labor government of Queensland, the Labor government of Victoria and the newly installed Labor government of Western Australia and remind them of their responsibilities to the schools they own and operate - the government schools of those states. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question and particularly note his concern about the case of Kerry and Kay Danes. As the honourable member said in his question, Kerry and Kay Danes were arrested in Vientiane in Laos on 23 December last year. It is a matter of very deep concern to our government that those two Australians have been held in prison in Laos since 23 December without any charges being laid against them. We regard that as completely unacceptable. There have been rumours and public statements coming out of Laos about activities that the Danes may or may not have been involved in, but no charges whatsoever have been laid against them.On two occasions, I have written to the Lao Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Somsavat, expressing the Australian government's concern, and many representations have been made by our embassy in Vientiane and by our ambassador there, Mr Thwaites, to the Lao government. But still no charges have been laid, and these two Australians remain in prison. Last Friday, when I was in Santiago de Chile, I took the opportunity of meeting with the Lao Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Somsavat, and expressed the deep concern of the Australian government - and, frankly, I think the deep concern of the Australian people - at the way the Danes have been treated by the Lao authorities. I made it clear to the Lao Deputy Prime Minister that the Lao authorities should immediately either demonstrate persuasively a case against the Danes or let them go. The fact that they have not been able to assemble a case against the Danes to lay charges and subject them to full court proceedings is a matter of very grave concern to the Australian government. The treatment of the Danes has implications for Australia's relationship with Laos. I explained to the Lao Deputy Prime Minister in particular that Mrs Danes is the mother of three young children, that those three young children are now back in Brisbane with her parents, being looked after, and that they have, of course, no opportunity to be with their own mother. To hold the mother in a prison without any charges for over three months is quite wrong. It is quite wrong. We expect these people either to be subjected to charges, if the Laos think that they are guilty of some offence, or to be released, and to be released at once.Through this period, the Australian Embassy in Vientiane, and the ambassador, Mr Thwaites, in particular, have done an outstanding job in providing consular assistance to Kerry and Kay. I congratulate the embassy on the excellent work that they have done. The embassy made their 13th weekly consular visit last Thursday, and I am glad to say that, on that particular occasion, Mrs Danes was able to speak with her children, using an embassy mobile phone. That has also been possible on other occasions. The Australian government is determined to ensure that justice is done by Kerry and Kay Danes. This has become a significant issue in our relationship with Laos. We expect Australians, whoever they are, when they are overseas, to be treated properly. As a government, we will always stand up for them when they get into difficulties. In this case, we will do all we can to ensure that the Danes are properly, honourably and justly dealt with.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition is talking about a budget being $180 million worse off, allegedly. That is a lot less than $10½ billion worse off. It is a lot less than the $85 billion of national debt that you racked up in the years that you were Minister for Finance. As to the question of the insertion of that figure in the costings that were provided, that figure was inserted on advice from the two departments. There was no attempt by the government to in any way mislead. On the question of whether there can be a projected level of bad debts, you know a lot about debt when it comes to budgets. The Leader of the Opposition has been the sort of finance minister expert at running up debt. Obviously, when these figures are inserted in the budget, they are inserted on official advice. That was the advice we received from the department of education. The costings were done by departments. They were not One Nation costings -   -  - I am going back to the statement of 1992 that bore that name, where the costings were done in the then Prime Minister's office. Who was the Deputy Prime Minister at that time? Unless I am mistaken, the Leader of the Opposition was the deputy -  -  - Oh, he was only a senior minister then! I am blown out of the water by the fact that I got that wrong by one or two years and that Brian Howe was the Deputy Prime Minister. Was he finance minister? - Oh, that is when he got unemployment up to 11.2 per cent. I am sorry. Aren't I absolutely shocking that I got that wrong! The reality is that these figures were inserted in the document on the advice of departments. Unlike the former government, we do not invent economic forecasts or budget figures in our ministerial offices. We rely on official advice, and the attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to suggest otherwise is quite puerile.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and also for his support for the workers and businesses in his electorate, who are now enjoying the benefits of more interest rate cuts. On day one Labor governments take office, on day two, in many industries at least, the union heavies fan out through the workplaces, orchestrating campaigns of wildcat strikes and bullying and blackballing non-union members. On Perth radio yesterday, Premier Gallop repeatedly refused to condemn the erection of no ticket no start banners, which are now sprouting up like mushrooms on Perth building sites. The Premier was then confronted by an eyewitness's account of a union act of intimidation who said: The union heavy said, `You pay your dues. As far as we are concerned, it is now a compulsory no-ticket no-start, and unless people like you adhere to that, there is no place for you to work in this building industry.All he could say when confronted by this was, `Has it been reported?' even though the first thing the Gallop government did was to abolish the building industry task force which was investigating and stamping out rackets in the commercial construction industry. Why is Premier Gallop so weak in the face of this flagrant breach of freedom of association principles? I should point out to the House that last year the CFMEU, which is masterminding this antiworker campaign, donated $402,000 to the Labor Party. That is $402,000 worth of hush money to members opposite. That is $402,000 to buy the silence of the Labor Party when faced with union orchestrated rorts, rackets and rip-offs in the commercial construction industry. What is more, the CFMEU claims the specific allegiance of two members of the caucus, including a frontbencher who can be relied upon to ensure that the party toes the union line. In the light of the mayhem now enveloping Perth building sites, the Leader of the Opposition needs to state a position. He needs to take a stand. Is the Leader of the Opposition going to condemn the closed shop, or does he stand condemned himself as the friend of the bully, the thug and the standover man? And will the Leader of the Opposition reverse his policy to abolish the office of the Employment Advocate, which is all that stands between the decent, honest workers of this country and organised industrial intimidation? </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. It is a very timely question, a very good question, if I may say so, and it goes to a matter which has been the subject of a fair bit of discussion in the parliament in recent times. I am pleased to be able to say to the House that the government's position on the Collins class submarines is clearly stated in the government's white paper - in fact, on page 90 - in respect of our determination to proceed to upgrade them. We are doing so even though the original cost announced was around $2.5 billion, it grew to $5 billion, and now we find that to fix up the submarines it is $1 billion on top of that. Of course, as most people in the House today would appreciate, the person as responsible as anybody else for the bungling of the Collins class submarines is none other than the Leader of the Opposition. I was very interested, therefore, to follow developments yesterday but in particular to read the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, because -   - Yes, I read the editorial, but I am interested in what you say - not so much the editorial. - We are indebted to the Sydney Morning Herald -  - I look forward to the shadow spokesman's question - that is fine - and he will want to say that we want to buy more than six submarines. The fact is that we are buying and upgrading the six submarines because that is all that the country can afford. We have a plan for 10 years which spells out a proper balance between the Army, Air Force and Navy. What we have had in the last three or four weeks is a bit of pressure on the opposition to tell the Australian public, honestly, what it is that they propose to do. That is why I was delighted that, after three or four weeks, finally the shadow minister confirmed the very point I have been making about Labor's policy. Here it is in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning:The Opposition yesterday left open the way open for a Labor government to commission more submarines if Australia's strategic interests required them.Furthermore:The Opposition spokesman on defence, Dr Stephen Martin, said there could be additional submarines 'down the track'.That is the very point that I have been making. Not only that, but if the Labor Party gets in it is not to be the Collins class submarine but in fact - and I take this from the Labor Party's web site today -  -  - Well, they had their policies from the web site yesterday, so I have got mine, and this one is dated 4 April 2001. So it is sitting there and it says that it is committed to the acquisition of two further subs. Furthermore, it says:Recent developments have suggested the possibility of Australia acquiring a revised or type II version of the Collins for this purpose. Labor will therefore review progress on the development of a new type of Collins as a potential upgrade for the extra two submarines.So they do not just have a plan for two additional submarines; they have got a new class of submarine - the Beazley class of submarines: Kim I and Kim II - at a cost of $1½ million or $2 billion. This is the plan. After three weeks, we finally extract it out of them. If they have a defence policy, why aren't they proud of it? If that is their policy, why don't they just state it instead of having the shadow minister talking to Michelle Grattan in the middle of the night. -  - The fact of the matter is -  - Just to conclude, the structure of Australia's defence forces in the future is a serious issue. - When the Labor Party were in last time, the fact is that they abolished a couple of battalions to pay for additional capability. If you are going to have additional capability, you have to be able to be prepared to pay for it. Either you can come to general revenue for it or, alternatively, you can delay, defer or not proceed with already announced capability. That is the simple point that we want to make. We will continue to make it, because it is a question yet to be answered by the Labor Party. We think the Australian people and Defence deserves a better answer than we have had so far. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question and acknowledge her keen interest, along with other members of the government, in the Australian grain industry, and particularly the marketing of wheat. This morning at Grains Week I announced the government's response to the national competition review and that Australia's single desk arrangements for exporting wheat would be retained. The national competition review has demonstrated that there are benefits to Australian grain growers, and indeed to the national economy, by maintaining this single desk. This government does not believe in competition just for competition's sake; we want to see real benefits accruing to industry. In this instance, when you consider that Australian grain growers are endeavouring to sell their product on corrupt world markets against particularly grain growers in the United States and Europe where around half of their income is actually received from government subsidies, it is important that our industry have the capacity to collectively sell their product in these sorts of markets.Whilst we will be retaining the single desk, we certainly want the Wheat Export Authority arrangements in relation to the issuing of permitting for niche markets to be improved and to become more seamless and to require less intervention. The Wheat Export Authority will work with the Australian Wheat Board to endeavour to put in place a more seamless system to encourage the development of those niche markets. In addition, the Wheat Export Authority will be required to develop transparent performance indicators to review the performance of the AWBI, which has the responsibility of delivering on the single desk policy of this government. That review will be transparent, and the indicators in place will be able to test how well the Australian Wheat Board is delivering in this regard. We will also not be deregulating the durum wheat industry, but the Wheat Board will work with durum growers to help deliver more flexible marketing arrangements.This response has been well and truly welcomed by the grain growers of Australia. This is again another contrast between the coalition in government and Labor in government. This whole wheat debate about the future regulation has simply passed the Labor Party by. It was not until yesterday that the shadow spokesman actually came out with a paltry statement in which he said we should look at this, that and the other thing and also to suggest that Labor was committed to the single desk. It is rather interesting that Labor is committed to the single desk when it is in opposition, but when it comes to government the story is altogether different. Premier Bracks was in favour of the single desk when he was in opposition, but now he is in government he is legislating, in spite of a 93 per cent of vote by barley growers to keep their single desk, to remove it. This is another classic example of Labor in government acting totally different from what Labor says in opposition.  - The reality is grain growers can expect nothing from Labor. It takes a coalition government to deliver the marketing arrangements -  - necessary to support our industries.</DOC>

 - The Herald Sun and the Age newspapers have recently run sensationalist stories regarding future sawlog availability in Victoria. The claims made have not been confirmed officially by the relevant Victorian minister. Were the claims to be correct, they would have no immediate effect because Victoria's sawmillers have six-year remaining supply contracts with the Victorian government, consistent with the agreed volumes under five separate regional forest agreements, all of which of course were negotiated by the Howard government, notwithstanding the four years that the previous government, which invented the proposal, had to complete any. However, the Victorian government has decided to use these rumours to delay joint-funded FISAP payments of $2.4 million to Victorian sawmills while the minister investigates the rumours. On 9 February Victorian Minister Garbutt wrote to me as follows, and in part:I am of the view that this would be sensible to review an appropriate balance between industry development and business exit components of VIC FISAP ...Put in other words, to provide a greater percentage of government money to close down sawmills and sack their workers. The government rejects these proposals in terms of both the resource supply and this orchestrated rumour campaign to allow the Victorian government to appease its activist constituency. The Howard government's commitment of $18 million to business development in Victoria is rock solid. Business development automatically multiplies itself by a component of five when private investment is included. Business exit payments are moneys down the drain. Of course, they were the major component of Labor's policy on this proposal, and I thank the Prime Minister for his agreement when we converted that money to keeping people in jobs. Business development grants are designed to allow sawmillers to do much more with less wood, with returns per cubic metres increasing threefold. These grants must be paid now to allow the industry to reorganise towards high value products. The highest grant recommended in this program - and I do not think the local member knows - is within the electorate of McMillan. The electorate of McEwen is also a major beneficiary, as are the electorates of Gippsland and Ballarat. All those members have been on my back daily to deliver this money. But where has the member for McMillan been? He held a meeting; he had to organise a stop-work meeting to get a crowd. He had it at the Algie Hall, but did he get Minister Garbutt to come along, as I have gone along to all of these electorates to reassure people, at the ministerial level, of our government's commitment to pay that money? Did the member for McMillan get the state minister along? No, he got the chief of staff. He was at pains to tell us in the Main Committee the other day that of course there was another great help present: the union was there.Two of these major parties to receive this money, including that sawmill in the electorate of McMillan, had non-unionised work forces. I wonder why the state government of Victoria do not want to pay them the money. They have put up a smokescreen about something that is six years away - they do not want to pay. Why? Because they want to get into these people. We have the money waiting, and we call upon the Victorian government to put up their share and pay now. We suggest to the member for McMillan that he starts to look after these people, not call meetings to soften them up for losing their jobs.</DOC>

 - I would suggest that the question in relation to this is not so much the way in which the honourable member framed the question but whether or not he can possibly be serious. The program to which he is referring is a flexible program put together out of the Regional Australia Summit and designed to recognise that one size does not fit all and that you cannot do it the way the ALP did it - impose solutions from Canberra, from on high -  - It has proved to be a very popular program. Last week, when we expected some 200 to 300 applications, we recorded our 761st. Of the applications that have come forward, some 60 have been approved. They go to what could only be described as a panel of highly reputable people, headed by Professor John Chudley. They are all assessed on their merits before they go to the ministerial council. The process accords with best practices and was checked off in consultation with the Auditor-General. The only thing I can say is I am sure that there are applications from Tasmania and that they will be assessed on their merits.The next question that I would have to ask - rhetorically, of course - is: whose program is this? Did the ALP ever have a program of this sort? Was there ever one? Was there ever from the ALP a Networking the Nation program - under which, along with the social bonus out of Telstra, it could hardly be suggested that Tasmania has missed out? When it comes to the local roads program, that was done on the most impartial grounds of all. We could hardly be accused there of doing the wrong thing by anybody: it was the ALP's formula by which money for the local roads program was distributed across the nation. Again, I simply pose - rhetorically, of course - the question: can he be serious?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro, who obviously is very much aware of the government's commitment to regional Australia, particularly in his electorate. I am aware of an article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald today written by Laura Tingle - an article which, I must say, is both inaccurate and offensive, to say the least, to the large number of Australians in regional communities who are working in partnership with the government to develop real projects that will develop real jobs and benefit the communities in which they live. There are, in fact, 56 area consultative communities spread throughout Australia, and these consist of around 300 active volunteers who work with their communities to generate projects that will make a real difference to the growth of their regions. To point out how inaccurate this article was, in referring to a project in Queensland, in the electorate of the member for Forde, the article refers to whether or not the body looking for Regional Assistance Program funding was incorporated. I can inform the journalist that it was the Beaudesert Equestrian Association Inc. Even such basic facts were incorrect, and inaccuracies were dotted throughout the article. The fact is that funds for RAP and Dairy RAP are not the same. They are both administered by my department - one, RAP funding, as part of the DEWRSB department and the other, Dairy RAP, on behalf of Minister Truss. Of course, Dairy RAP is different in that part of the funding can go to private enterprise. It can go to farms and the like on a 50:50 basis. The idea is to assist those organisations and communities which are suffering as a result of dairy deregulation - deregulation that, I might add, has occurred at state level - to create new work opportunities, and the Dairy Regional Assistance Program is aimed at doing just that. That was one of the projects that was funded under the application of the Beaudesert Equestrian Association Inc. Ms Tingle also produces figures for the number of RAP projects approved in the year 1999-2000. These figures are wildly inaccurate. There were, in fact, a total of 439 projects - not 115, as reported - approved in that period, to a value of not $8.7 million but $25 million, which was injected into rural and regional Australia by the Howard government. Over 79 per cent of the projects were in rural and regional Australia. Unlike the statement in the article, 60 per cent went to coalition seats and 40 per cent went to Labor seats. When you consider the spread of seats that the coalition holds in rural and regional Australia, that is hardly surprising.There are also allegations in relation to Mr Read, who was employed by the Canterbury-Bankstown committee of the Office of Labour Market Adjustment, or OLMA. This is a program of the former failed Labor government and it had very broad guidelines - and that is being generous. Mr Read was disturbed by the way in which he was put off by this committee. The fact is that he had a case before the Industrial Relations Commission that brought down in his favour the decision that he was owed $20,000. That is OLMA, a former figment of the Labor Party -  - Almost a figment of your imagination - that is probably right. They were so unjust in the way in which money was broadly handed out. The fact is that the federal Liberal government, the Howard government, has no responsibility at all for this gentleman's $20,000 because he was employed under the Labor government's OLMA committee and that is now a defunct committee. That is the advice that has been provided to me by the department.The article goes on to refer to a very significant project in regional Australia put together by the Visy pulp and paper mill. This is an article which suggests that the money that has been provided by the federal government through RAP was in fact not properly distributed. There was $16.05 million of RAP money put into this project - a project that was supported by the Labor state government to the tune of $61 million in a total expenditure of $400 million. This is about real jobs. It created 260 direct jobs and there are estimates that there will be an additional 1,000 jobs generated in the local region and beyond over the next five to 10 years. The article is not only inaccurate; it is offensive to the many volunteers that put their hard time and effort into working with the government to promote regional and rural Australia throughout this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for that question. When I visited the honourable member's electorate I met many hundreds of people who were indeed appreciative of the strong economic management of the government. They also had very strong recollections of the disastrous economic management of those who now sit opposite. All the people I saw when I visited places like Frankston in the honourable member's electorate would have been absolutely staggered if they had been confronted with the statement that was made by the Leader of the Opposition this morning at his regular doorstop in which he said:What I say to those who have concerns about us is this: we were good economic managers in this country for 13 years. That is out of the mouth of the man who presided over unemployment of 11.2 per cent. I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition remembers the release that was put out on 10 December 1992 that says `Little change in unemployment during November'. It came from the now Leader of the Opposition, and it recorded the fact that the unemployment rate increased in November by 0.1 per cent to 11.4 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms, according to figures released on that day by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That, of course, was the human tragedy face of the recession that was brought about by the incompetent management of the Australian economy, where you drove the economy into the ground by running an aggressive policy of ratcheting up interest rates and you had a Treasurer who boasted about a recession the country had - and you were a senior minister in that government.Can I remind the House that not only is there manifest evidence of the benefits of the good economic management of this government but there is a rich load of comparison to be made between the economic credentials of this government and the economic performance of those who sit opposite - a reminder not only of the high interest rates and the high unemployment but of the $85 billion of national government debt that you ran up when you were the Minister for Finance. In their last five years, Labor delivered budget deficits of $11.6 billion, $17 billion, $17.1 billion, $13.2 billion and $10.1 billion - not a bad effort in five budgets.By contrast, under the coalition the living standards of Australians have improved markedly. GDP per capita has increased at an annual average rate of 2.8 per cent; real household disposable income has grown by 3½ per cent; the real wealth of Australians has grown by an average of eight per cent; and recent ABS data indicates that this has not been at the cost of greater income inequality. One of the constant mantras of those who sit opposite is that the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer under this government. Unfortunately for those who mouth that mantra, the ABS income distribution survey for 1999-2000 - the latest one available, I understand - found quite the opposite. It found that the proportion of couples with dependent children and who are reliant on welfare support for more than 90 per cent of their income has fallen from 8.4 per cent in 1995-96, the last financial year of the Labor administration, to 7.2 per cent in 1999-2000. So not only have we boosted the real incomes of average Australians, not only have we cut their interest rate by $300 a month, not only have we seen their living standards rise right across the board; we have also actually seen a significant fall in the measured poverty of the lower income people of this country. That completely gives the lie to the nonsense pedalled.In the area of real wages, the coalition has presided over an economy that has delivered increases in real wages for Australian workers. Wages have increased by more than nine per cent over the last four years. This is compared with a total rise of just 3.6 per cent in the 13 years of your allegedly good economic management. Under the coalition, workers on the federal minimum wage have seen their real wages rise by around nine per cent. In contrast, under Labor's accord, the equivalent wage is estimated to have fallen by something like five per cent in real terms. So I would say to the member for Dunkley and to those he represents so well in this place that there is plenty of evidence of the good economic management credentials of this government. They have delivered benefits to Australian families. The contrast with the record of those who sit opposite is obvious and compelling, as demonstrated by the figures that I have used in this answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. I can inform the House that, by and large, the public of Australia and business welcomed yesterday's interest rate cuts. The deputy national secretary of the Master Builders Association said that the latest cut - the third this year - and the government's first home owners $14,000 grant will bolster the fundamentals for a housing recovery. The Housing Industry Association said:The outlook for new home buyers has improved considerably over the past few months. We have been receiving many positive reports for the month of March with inquiries and sales up some 100 per cent to 200 per cent on the previous month.As I said yesterday, it has never been a better time to buy a home. If you are a first home buyer, you can get a $14,000 grant and now you can get an interest rate at 6.8 per cent and, on the standard Australian mortgage, save $3,700 of interest, which you would have been paying had the Labor Party's rates been maintained.As far as I can tell, there was only one group which yesterday complained about the interest rate cut, and that was the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party seemed very disappointed at yesterday's interest rate cuts and blamed the GST for lower interest rates - as if there were something wrong with lower interest rates. They blame the GST because interest rates are falling. People actually think an interest rate fall is a good thing! Notwithstanding the fact that the Labor Party spent all of last year saying that the GST would increase interest rates, yesterday they were blaming it for reducing interest rates. Of course, the opportunistic barrage was led by a certain member on the other side, the chief opportunist of the federal parliament. Every now and then he comes out with a little gem that surprises even us. Yesterday was one of those days. He was asked whether lower interest rates would threaten the currency. He said this: The question of the currency is a significant matter of perception overseas. This is a government that has done nothing to promote the so-called fundamentals that they talk about so often. They have hardly been over there. So apparently he thinks the government does not travel enough, something that no-one would ever accuse him of not doing enough of. Then he said this: The recent visit that I did was like a breath of fresh air coming in over there because they said, `We do not get this from the government of the day.' I was there talking up the fundamentals of the Australian economy. The member for Hotham was in London and New York and Paris to talk up the fundamentals of the Australian economy! We should be so grateful that he travels the world just to talk up the fundamentals of the Australian economy. It is so obvious. He does it every day. He will do it in London and New York and Paris. It would really surprise us if he did it in Australia. That would be a great surprise to us. Here is the member for Hotham - old, opportunistic Harry over there. He is at it every day. He was at it at a soccer game on Saturday, calling the cameras down, presumably so he could talk up the fundamentals of the Australian economy. Opportunistic Harry takes every opportunity that he can to make political mileage and political capital. He had a bad day yesterday because interest rates were falling. He has not contributed one sensible policy in relation to the economy and, as for his claim that all he does is talk up its fundamentals, it appears there is now nothing he will not say or do for political advantage.  </DOC>

I have had nothing to do with them before and nothing to do with them since. I was aware there was a negotiation going on but I did not know the nature of that negotiation.

 - I thank the member for Barker for his interest in this matter. Currently, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has only limited power to protect businesses that may be the innocent victim of secondary boycott actions that may affect their day-to-day business. Just to remind members, a secondary boycott occurs when two or more people work together to stop a supplier from supplying goods or services to another business or consumer. For example, if we took a butcher's shop in Cessnock - which just happens to be in the member for Hunter's electorate - and had a situation where a local delicatessen had some dispute with its staff, the employees at that delicatessen could then perhaps persuade the employees of the local butcher's shop, through their union, to prevent that butcher's shop from supplying meat to the delicatessen. Currently, that local butcher's shop needs to use all its own resources to take the big union to court to try and protect its revenue. The unanimous recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector - the Baird committee, the member for Cook's committee - in August 1999 was that the ACCC should be given the power and the resources to undertake the defence of someone like that innocent butcher's shop in Cessnock. It is interesting that on that committee - which was a bipartisan committee - were the member for Hunter, the member for Scullin, Senator Michael Forshaw and Senator Chris Schacht. The government has pledged to provide the ACCC with all the resources necessary to help protect innocent small businesses that might be the victim of a secondary boycott.When the matter came before this House on 9 November, the member for Hunter consistently supported protection for small business. So too did the member for Swan. He stood up in this place and said, `We need to protect small businesses.' So too did the member for Cunningham, who is also on the front bench. He said, `Yes, we need to protect small businesses.' In fact, the member for Wills, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, said that we were not going far enough to protect small businesses. Twenty-one minutes after the member for Wills said we were not going far enough, the member for Brisbane and shadow minister for workplace relations came into this place and said, `We're going to oppose what the government is doing.' Twenty-one minutes later the chief representative of the union movement in the Labor Party did over his colleagues who had been supporting small business and said, `No, we are going to back away from this.' The ALP were given another opportunity to protect small business yesterday. They were provided with the opportunity to actually vote to protect small businesses; to give those innocent small businesses out there - the more than one million small businesses out there who may not have the resources to take on the big unions - the protection of the ACCC. Yesterday, the Labor Party voted for their union mates ahead of the interests of Australia's small businesses.I was asked about alternative policies. There is one alternative policy and it came from the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition when he said on 6PR on 7 July 2000:We have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party. We have never pretended that.Well, at least on this occasion, they are backing their words with action.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I can assure him that this government is all in favour of people joining industrial organisations but believes that people do have a perfect entitlement to know exactly how their membership fees are spent. I can say that I very much appreciate the historic role of unions, for instance, in civilising capitalism, but I do not see why unions should have the unique privilege in modern Australia of owning and operating their own political party. In the interests of democratic accountability, I put it to the Leader of the Opposition: is he aware that three of his senior frontbenchers spoke on the More Jobs Better Pay workplace relations bill in this House without first declaring the union that they were a member of and without declaring the amount of money that that union provided to the Labor Party? For instance, does he know that the member for Batman failed to declare his membership of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, and he failed to declare that this union gave $835,000 to the Labor Party the previous year? The member for Jagajaga failed to declare her membership of the Commonwealth Public Service Union and the fact that it had given $45,000 to the Labor Party in the previous year. The member for Wills failed to declare his membership of the Australian Workers Union and the fact that it had donated $495,000 to the Australian Labor Party the previous year.  On the standards that members opposite were trying to insist upon yesterday after question time, not a single member of the opposition could stand up and speak on any subject - not on health, not on transport, not on education, not on industrial relations - without first declaring their union membership and all of the donations that their unions have made to the Labor Party. Lack of democratic accountability is almost a hallmark of ACTU Labor Inc. - or Nepotism Inc., as the member for Werriwa so well put it the other day. On that score, federal Labor is more inbred than the House of Lords. On my reckoning, there are nine hereditary peers - people who have followed their fathers into parliament - there are four noble families where siblings are in parliament and there are six royal couples where husband and wife are in parliament. This is modern Labor - Nepotism Inc.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and for his strong support for the small businesses in his electorate. This government's workplace relations policies have been very good for small business. Australian workplace agreements have allowed workers to negotiate their own pay and conditions without the necessity of union involvement. This is the first time in 100 years people have had this right. The Office of the Employment Advocate has policed the freedom of association provisions, and it is the first time in 100 years we have had this kind of watchdog in our country. As a result of this government's workplace relations policies, industrial disputation in Australia is at its lowest level since records were first kept in 1913. I have been asked about alternative policies. Members opposite do have a workplace relations policy, because it was dictated to them by the ACTU prior to the Labor Party's national conference last year. They would abolish Australian workplace agreements, depriving workers of choice. They would abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate and expose workers to the tender mercies of organised thugs in the workplace. They want to put a 1.5 per cent payroll tax on all businesses, including all small businesses, to protect entitlements, rather than support the government's Employee Entitlement Safety Net Scheme. They want to charge five million workers a $500 a year union tax because they have not seen fit to join a union. They want to allow industry-wide strikes, which means that a strike at one business can very quickly become a strike at all businesses.Under the guise of good faith bargaining, they want to insist that all businesses may have to expose their books of account and their business plans to union organisers, and they want to allow unions to abolish youth wages, which will put tens of thousands of young people onto the dole queues. As the Leader of the Opposition said, he has never pretended to run a small business party. What he did say is this: I am not a Labor leader who relishes the idea of there being substantial points of disagreement between ourselves and the union movement.That is the Leader of the Opposition's policy: to march in lock step with the union movement. If you are not allowed to govern yourselves, you should never be allowed to govern the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Calwell for that question. It does provide me with an opportunity to clearly state the government's position. The government's position is that the best guarantee of fundamental human rights in this country is to have three things in our society. The first of those is to have a vigorous and open political system where political parties are freestanding organisations beholden to no one section of the Australian community. I am glad the member for Calwell nods. That is the first and great requirement of a robust democracy: that we come into this place owing allegiance to nothing other than the service of all of the Australian people and not one section of the Australian people. That is the first requirement.The second requirement is to have a due process of law, a judicial system which is incorruptible. I believe that the Australian judicial system over the past 200 years has certainly met that requirement. Whatever frustrations we may feel on occasions with the processes of the courts, the record of impartially administered justice in this country is something of which all Australians can indeed be proud. It does not mean to say that it is perfect, it does not mean to say that it is not without complexity, it does not mean to say that it is not in need of reform and it does not mean to say that it is not too expensive for people on occasions. But fundamentally it is fair, it is incorruptible and it has served the Australian community well.The third thing that I think we need in this country, and need in any society, to guarantee fundamental human rights is to have a free press. There are occasions when all of us chafe under that discipline, but it is nonetheless an indispensable element of a free and open democratic society.  It will follow from that that I do not and the government does not support the establishment of a formal bill of rights, either by way of legislation or by adoption into the Australian Constitution. In case anybody imagines that I speak from some partisan Liberal Party point of view on this, I would point out to the House that my views have been very strongly supported by none other than the most successful Labor leader in this country, namely, the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, who has delivered a submission to a parliamentary inquiry on this subject and has used essentially the same arguments as I have used. I would not for a moment accuse him of plagiarism; I simply make the observation that his views are virtually identical with the views I have expressed on this issue.Finally, in relation to that part of the honourable gentleman's question that referred to the legislation currently before the parliament, which I think relates to the Teoh case, it is my understanding that the former government itself had indicated a desire to proceed down essentially the same path as we are now proceeding down in relation to our legislation. I hold the strongest possible view, as does the government, that the obligations of Australians should be defined by the laws of Australians made by Australians in Australia. That is a fundamental of a sovereign political entity and it is a view to which I adhere very strongly. We respect the role of international treaties, but they should not be used except by the express will of the duly elected parliaments of this country. They should not be used to define either the rights or the obligations of Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I know he is a strong advocate of small business. I am aware of newspaper reports of an Australian Business Ltd survey which shows that 58 per cent of respondents lie awake at night worrying about unfair dismissal. - Those opposite say it is rubbish but we know they agree that unfair dismissal is an issue. Why do we know? Because the shadow minister for small business says so. He has acknowledged that, when he is out and about, small businesses raise unfair dismissal with him. The government certainly recognise that unfair dismissal is an issue. We understand what small business are saying to us. We know what they say about unfair dismissal and we have tried repeatedly - time after time - to introduce unfair dismissal legislation which will assist small business to better manage their work force. COSBOA, the representative group of small business, also recognise the importance of unfair dismissal amendments and have said that, were the amendments carried, 50,000 new jobs would be created. - The member for Hunter interjects again, but he knows that this is an issue; yet how has he described our government's attempts to introduce amendments to unfair dismissal? He describes them as `futile' - futile to create more jobs, futile to give more Australians a job. I am not aware of any other policies from that side of the House to assist small business in this area of unfair dismissal. As we have just heard from the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, the Labor Party are not a party for small business; they themselves admit that. We the coalition are a party for small business and we will continue to try to introduce fairer unfair dismissal laws.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the internal memo within the New South Wales Labor government about this matter. I understand that a number of people have, including a number of journalists, and I would appreciate the member for Hotham providing me with a copy of that memo. If he has a copy, could he please provide me with a copy of that memo? The member for Hotham is welcome to table the memo. - The member for Hotham is saying that he is quoting from a memo that he has not got; therefore I cannot verify the quote. When the matter in relation to the MAA was first raised with me, I asked the chief executive officer of APRA for advice. The allegations are being made about discussions between APRA and the Motor Accidents Authority in New South Wales, so I was obviously not a party to those discussions. - The chief executive officer of APRA advised me in writing, advice which I tabled in the House. Just to refresh the memory of the member for Hotham, he advised me:I confirm APRA's advice to you on that day - that is, 29 March - that neither the New South Wales government nor the Motor Accidents Authority in New South Wales, the MAA, advised or instructed APRA that it should appoint an inspector to the HIH Insurance group at any time.He goes on to say:For your further information, I have consulted APRA officers who were involved in discussions with the MAA about HIH in late October/early November 2000. Their clear recollection of those discussions is that the MAA advised it was considering its options for the appointment of an inspector to HIH with regards to its motor vehicle compulsory third party business. The APRA officers advised that APRA was working closely with HIH on various questions about its financial position and was not at that time intending to appoint an inspector. APRA officers provided the MAA with APRA's latest assessment of HIH. MAA officers did not suggest that APRA itself should appoint an inspector. At no point did APRA argue that the MAA should not appoint an inspector because that would cause a loss of market confidence in HIH. The member for Hotham has in his possession a New South Wales Labor government internal memo making allegations about APRA. I have not seen that memo. I can get advice only from the independent regulator that is advising on this matter. The chief executive of the independent regulator has put that in writing, and I have tabled that advice in the House. If that does not satisfy the concerns of the member for Hotham, I would ask him to get a copy of the internal memo of the New South Wales Labor Party and provide me with that information so that I can further explore the matter. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is now possible to fly between Brisbane and Melbourne for $54. We have two new entrants in the aviation market. They are launched, they are there and they are succeeding. They are filling up their aeroplanes, unlike what happened under Labor, and you can fly from Brisbane to Melbourne for $54. There are thousands and thousands of people travelling by air who could never have afforded it before. At the same time as we have done that, we have managed other important objectives - for example, that the people of regional New South Wales will continue to have fair and equitable access to Sydney airport even in the peak hours.Then there is the historic $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery program, which continues to go from strength to strength. It was announced only four months ago and 75 per cent of all councils across Australia have registered. Around $45 million is already out there being used to upgrade roads as part of this very much needed program that fixes those roads that had become completely forgotten under Labor. On the waterfront, our major ports have achieved what the ALP and its union bosses said Australians could not do. They said we could not move 25 containers on average per hour in Australia. We have achieved it. I think it verges on being un-Australian to say of your fellow Australians, `They can't achieve world's best.' We said Australians could, Labor said they could not, and we have done it.We have listened to people living in rural and regional Australia and we have acted - and we have acted in a way that has given rural communities the tools and the ability to make their own decisions about their own futures, both socially and economically. There are alternative policies and - Government member - What? You're joking! - With the ALP you look at what they do, not what they say. Unfortunately, you can neither listen to what the federal ALP would do nor read it. For all the work that the member for Dickson was going to do when the regional policy was about to appear - it was nearly ready; we never saw it -  - It was! It was done. It was about to appear. But when the member for Batman came into the office he said that there was nothing there. He said that the cupboard was bare. The member for Dickson would not share the regional policy with the member for Batman. - I don't know. It might have been worse sharing with the member for Batman, because going on the ALP's record it was probably our policy anyway. It was probably plagiarism. Obviously, the member for Batman had to start again from scratch. He has been there for quite a while, but we still have not heard anything from him. Nor have we heard anything in some other important areas of rural and regional policy. On telecommunications, all we get is the member for slander - I mean the member for Swan - talking about the issue of ownership, never about a policy that might deliver better telecommunications outcomes for rural and regional Australians. Then there is health. Where are they on rural health? They were responsible for the lack of policy and the lack of resources that has seen us some 500 doctors short across regional and rural Australia, and probably 800 to 900 specialists short. Where is their rural health policy? You cannot read what they put down in policy or listen to what they say because they have not got policies, but you can get a pretty fair idea of what the bush would have in store for it by looking at what they do at state level. Over in Western Australia, as the member for O'Connor would be aware, the ALP has been in power for two months, and that is all it took to close the air service to Busselton. The impact on tourism in that fast growing region can only be imagined. Then there is the Bracks government: promises everywhere for rural and regional Australia, as the member for Wannon knows.   - They have been delivered, have they? What about that fast train service to Ballarat that they were talking about? Where did it go? Then there is New South Wales. Where has New South Wales been? Let me come to health. What has the New South Wales government been doing at Mudgee in my electorate? We had to drag it kicking and screaming to ensure that you could actually have a baby in Mudgee instead of having to go 150 kilometres to Dubbo. It would not grapple with the problem of indemnity. - Well, there you go. Then there has been its refusal to meet its responsibilities on water property rights with disastrous outcomes for environmental reform and for local communities. It does not give a damn about anybody who lives west of the sandstone curtain in that state. The policies of the state Labor governments around the country are clear signs of what federal Labor would do to the bush. They would dictate policy from the comfortable cafés of Manuka, Kingston and Balmain rather than be out there in Albury, Charleville and Gunnedah.  - </DOC>

 - The beds which were announced this week are not phantom beds; they are beds which are guaranteed and funded. The $182 million covers all aged care places. That includes the high level care beds, the low level care beds and the 2,250 community aged care packages. Of the 14,000 places that were allocated last year, which included both high and low level care beds and community aged care packages, already 40 per cent of those which were announced on 12 January are operational, and those are community care packages which come on stream, on average, within three months. The forward estimates show that the beds that are allocated beds, on average, take some two to three years to come on stream. As the Auditor-General pointed out in his report:The situation was that the number of operational ... aged care places in 1997 - that is, after the election and after we received your legacy - was approximately 6.5 per cent below the official target at 93.5 places for every 1,000 aged persons. This shortfall is not temporary. Rather, it is inherent in the system since fulfilment of the provision of one year's provisional approvals -  -  - As you are not familiar with the Auditor-General's report, I will remind you of it again:The situation was that the number of operational aged care places in 1997 was approximately 6.5 per cent below the official target at 93.5 places for every 1,000 aged persons. This shortfall is not temporary. Rather, it is inherent in the system since fulfilment of the provision of one year's provisional approvals will simply be replaced by the next year's unfulfilled provisional approval undertakings. To meet the target planning ratio immediately, an addition of nearly 10,100 places would be needed.This government has accepted the Auditor-General's recommendations. We brought on the 10,000 places that he said were necessary to be put into the system to correct the inherent deficit that was left by years of neglect. It averaged 93 places about 1991 and was consistent until you lost office and you left that permanent deficit. You left a mess that we had to clean up, and that is precisely what we are doing. By announcing, as we do, in accordance with the planning mechanisms at the beginning of each year, in the first quarter of each year, what beds will be available for that particular year, with the announcement being made at the end of the year, people are able to plan in an orderly way and that, indeed, was another recommendation of the Auditor-General. The fact of the matter is that the money that I announced that those places are worth is provided for. We anticipate that, by the year 2002, operational beds will meet the ratio of 100 places per 100,000 people aged 70 or above. I might say that the only phantom thing around here is the Labor Party's phantom policy. The only thing that you have got to offer is something that mimics our policy. I can only say that copying is a very good form of flattery.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is now 193 days since Cathy Freeman won a gold medal for Australia and the Leader of the Opposition tried to sneak through the ALP's biggest single commitment since the 1996 election - to keep the 30 per cent rebate without a means test or a cap. Since then, it would be fair to say that the Leader of the Opposition has been less than vocal in support of his biggest single policy commitment in five years, but his shadow spokesperson, the member for Jagajaga, has been even less vocal, if that is possible. In the 193 days she has made only one comment, and that was in the Australian on Monday, 19 February when she was quoted as saying,We've been saying for ages that the private health rebate doesn't take pressure off public hospitals.She went on to say that the government should spend at least $600 million extra on public hospitals. It is not often that an opposition spokesperson criticises their own policy, but we have it here. Of course we know that the increase in private health insurance take-up by Australians is, in fact, taking pressure off public hospitals. PHIAC figures for the six months up to December 2000 compared to the six months up to December 1999 show private hospital usage is up 12.1 per cent. But perhaps the strongest evidence comes from a Labor state - New South Wales - where, in the annual report of the New South Wales Department of Health, it shows that in 1999-2000 admissions to public hospitals were down 36,000, while private hospital admissions were up 35,000 during the same period - some way into fixing the problem. I was interested in the member for Jagajaga's comments about $600 million extra going into public hospitals and I asked myself, `Why $600 million? Where did this figure come from and where is the Labor Party going to get the money to fund it?' Members might be interested to learn that I asked my department, `What would be the money saved if you took the 30 per cent rebate off ancillary cover, for example?' Guess what? The figure is $644 million. Since last September, at no stage has the opposition ruled out taking the 30 per cent rebate off extras cover. I am not surprised, when you consider what this would do to Australian families - making them pay more for dental, chiropractic, physiotherapy, speech therapy, spectacles, contact lenses, ambulance cover and a whole lot of other health benefits.It is 193 days since the Leader of the Opposition made his $2 billion commitment, and the shadow spokesperson is yet to utter a word of support for her leader's comments. Next Thursday will be the anniversary of 200 days since the Ballarat backflip, and it gives the member for Jagajaga the chance in the next seven days to absolutely and categorically rule out that Labor is going to take the 30 per cent rebate off ancillary cover. If she does not come clean about Labor's rolling back of the rebate, it will be confirmed and millions of Australians will be confronted with the prospect of a Beazley government rolling back their health insurance. </DOC>

 - No. The minister has done no such thing because, far from short-changing the families of Australia, this government with its policy has significantly boosted the real incomes of Australian families. I just happen to have a headline here, `Everything's right at the Wright house'. It is an article in today's Australian, and it is not a bad read. Government member - Sydney Morning Herald?  - No, today's Australian. It is quite a good read. It is very good news for the member for Parramatta because the family in question lives in the suburb of Westmead. I think it is probably the quality of the representation that has made this family. Listen to this -  -  - It really goes to the heart of how Australian families are feeling and faring at the present time. It says: Economists may be nervously preoccupied with the battered dollar ... and the shrinking budget surplus but for the Wright family, life is sweet. Part of the aspirational middle class, the couple from the western Sydney suburb of Westmead remain unconcerned about the prospects of an economic slowdown. And why wouldn't they? Interest rates are down again. Tax reform has delivered more dollars into their pockets, and in the absence of any plans for an overseas holiday this year, the low dollar seems an irrelevance.  The article goes on to describe how this aspirational middle class family has greatly benefited from, and been greatly helped by, the tax reform policy of the government that I am proud to lead. The tax reform changes that were brought in last year represented real increases in the disposable incomes of Australian families. The minister has made no such admission. The minister strongly supports the policy because she knows that it is good for the Australian family.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the member for Aston for his question and particularly recognise the great interest he has shown in human rights issues and the performance of the United Nations committees. In August of last year the government announced the outcome of our review of the interaction with the six core human rights treaty committees. Honourable members will be aware that this government has been extremely critical of the performance of the United Nations committee system. Our review revealed considerable weaknesses in the way the treaty committees operate, including a lack of recognition of the primary role of democratic governments, a lack of coordination between the committees and at times a distinct failure by some of those committees to act within their mandates.There is widespread agreement within the United Nations system about the need for reform and there is concern about the credibility of the United Nations treaty committee system. As we said at the time, it is not that we are against the system itself; it is our view that if the system is to be credible and to have any impact then it has to work efficiently, effectively and be a system which addresses the core issues. In our discussions over the last few months with both the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, both of them have agreed that the United Nations human rights committee system does need reform.Today the Attorney-General, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and I have announced a high level diplomatic initiative to give momentum to our campaign for the reform of these United Nations committees. As part of that initiative, we will host a ministerial meeting in the margins of the General Assembly in New York in September to discuss with other ministers ways of improving the system. We will host three workshops over three years to examine key reform issues and build consensus around practical achievable measures.But Australia will not stop there. In recent times we have had great success in winning elections in the United Nations system. We had Professor Ivan Shearer elected as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Committee - in the teeth, by the way, of opposition from the Australian Labor Party. I am glad to say the international community supported the Australian candidate, even though the Labor Party quite clearly opposed Professor Shearer because we would not run Elizabeth Evatt, who had two terms on the committee. So when we said we would run Professor Shearer the Labor Party said that was a disgrace and they opposed his campaign. Despite that, he was elected by the international community, which knows more about the credibility of this country than the Australian Labor Party does.The member for Aston asked whether there are alternative approaches, and there is a quite clear alternative approach. As the Labor Party demonstrated in August of last year, it is totally opposed to any reform of United Nations committees. It does not support reform of the committees. The Labor Party has been applauding when United Nations committees have quite wrongly and quite inappropriately criticised this country. The first people to the microphones to cheer this country's critics over the last five years have been the Australian Labor Party. There is actually a quite simple difference between this side of the House and that side of the House: on this side of the House we stick up for Australia, and on that side of the House you stick up for our critics. </DOC>

 - I can categorically say I was not aware of the consortium, and that is the nature of it. I was not aware of Virax; I was not aware of the companies involved. But, if you want to know about the speculation around this, I suggest you have a look at the newspapers. On 13 May, about six weeks before the announcement, the Daily Telegraph, page 7, or the Canberra Times, 13 May, page 4, `HIV treatment trial' -   - it was reported in both newspapers. And it was reported by the University of New South Wales. I will read it:200 Australians would take part in a $74 million international trial for a new HIV treatment.There it is in the Daily Telegraph. - I am still going, Mr Speaker. That was the first point. The second point is that I said earlier in question time that I had mentioned the NIH and partnerships but nothing about a consortium and nothing about what the nature of it was. And do you know why I was doing that, Mr Speaker? Because I wanted to tell 700 scientists how inspirational we were with medical research doubling the funding and how pathetic you were as finance minister - the finance minister that was on the public record as saying it wouldn't matter how much you gave them they would still whinge! -   - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The third point I make, because it is relevant to who knew, the opposition was asserting earlier in question time that I had stated yesterday in the Hansard that my staff did not know until the 28th. If you have a look at Hansard, clearly I did not say that. My staff obviously had to know to put together a press release. The Labor Party is misrepresenting it for its own circumstances - and, boy, hasn't question time been a fizzer for you, Sport!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and certainly acknowledge her interest in the subject. Federation money is going to the people of Brisbane, as promised. The Bruce Highway is the major artery northbound from Brisbane. Each day between 48,000 and 72,000 vehicles use the route between the Pine River Bridge and Caboolture, around nine per cent of those being commercial. This $40 million upgrade will alleviate congestion at peak times, improve the travel time for commuters and the delivery time for agricultural and manufacturing goods to and from cities and regions north of Brisbane. With tourism being one of the largest industries in Queensland, the upgrade will provide a world standard motorway for the thousands of visitors who include Queensland in their Australian trips each year. It is part of the $65 million we announced as Federation grants to Queensland. There was also $20 million to the Comprehensive Cancer Research Centre at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, $5 million to the Beaudesert shire railway project and of course a contribution to the feasibility for that visionary project on the Gold Coast, light rail. On Tuesday, when this funding was announced - and perhaps we should not have been surprised - Queensland Premier Beattie did not seem very keen about it. He called it pork-barrelling! I regret to say that he tried to put words into the mouth of the Prime Minister about it - no playing the game straight at all! The federal government had originally intended that this funding be for the Brisbane light rail project. But who pulled the pin on it? Mr Beattie and his cabinet were the people who pulled the pin on this project. The man who called this pork-barrelling pulled the pin on it. It was then up to the federal government to determine how best to deploy these funds in the interests of the people of Brisbane. In a nutshell, this $40 million Bruce Highway upgrade will substantially benefit the people of Brisbane and Brisbane's outer northern region, which is the third fastest growing region in Australia. It is, without doubt, good news for the people of Brisbane. But, in the face of this good news, the ALP demonstrates that it is indeed the very model of a modern Labor Party - it will simply oppose. It has no policies, no vision; it offers no direction and no hope, just opposition. </DOC>

 - That would come into the category of a most interesting question. - Yes, I bet it does, because it comes from a man who was a member of a government that gave no compensation to pensioners when they increased indirect taxation. People will never forget that in 1993, after promising before the 1993 election not to increase taxes, Labor increased all wholesale sales taxes, increased petrol excise and gave exactly zero compensation to Australian pensioners. It prompted Professor Neil Warren from the University of New South Wales, in 1998 in a paper on indirect taxation, to say that the 1993 indirect tax changes impacted most heavily on the unemployed and the aged. That is the record of the man who dares to ask me about compensation for pensioners! When you had the opportunity - when the Labor Party had the opportunity - to compensate the pensioners of Australia for taxation adjustments, you gave them no compensation at all. I am very proud to lead a government that has recognised the contribution of older Australians to the Australian community - and I do not have a youth branch of my party describing it as an old fogy's budget either, with the sort of contemptuous attitude being taken by Young Labor towards this budget.These measures have been made possible by the prudent fiscal policies carried out by the government over the last five years. Of one thing you can be absolutely certain: you would not be in a position to pay compensation to anybody, either in relation to a new taxation system or in a budget, if you were doing it off the back of 17 per cent interest rates, $96 billion of government debt and 11 per cent unemployment. The reality is that it is our good economic management - it is the work of the Treasurer and the government over the last five years - that has made it possible for us to deliver a budget that is being widely supported and widely acclaimed in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - Can I say, in reply to the honourable member for Gilmore, who is a magnificent representative of a cross-section of the Australian community, that this budget demonstrates very clearly to the Australian community what you can do if you keep your economic house in order. This budget demonstrates that, if you run successive surpluses, if you are prepared in your early years of government to take difficult but necessary decisions, if you are prepared to embrace industrial relations reform, if you are prepared to embrace tax reform, if you are prepared to embrace fiscal consolidation - in other words, if you are a government that governs for the longer term interests of the Australian community - you can put yourself in a position to deliver benefits. You can never deliver sustainable benefits to the Australian community if you have to go into the red to do it. It would have never been possible for the former government to have delivered benefits to the Australian community in a sustainable fashion because for five years the now Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for Finance, ran up budget deficit after budget deficit, so much so that when we came to government not only did we inherit an economy that had been crippled by 17 per cent interest rates and a high of 11 per cent unemployment but also we inherited an economy that was burdened by $96 billion of government debt. - Mr Speaker, let me say it again in case the member for Paterson did not hear: you left us with $96 billion of government debt - $96 billion - and not only did you leave us with $96 million of government debt but you have tried for the last five years to stop us paying it back. So you compounded the political felony of leaving us with $96 billion of government debt by endeavouring to stop us paying it back. But, despite your best efforts, we have succeeded in repaying, on behalf of the Australian people, $60 billion of the $96 billion of government debt that the Beazley-Keating Labor government ran up.It is because of that and because we now have an interest rate structure and an economic structure that represent Australia to the world as a very strong economy that it is possible to deliver benefits to the Australian people. We do not have to go into the red to deliver these benefits; we are able to do it from the vantage point of a prudent fiscal position. I am delighted that we are able to recognise the contribution of older Australians. I am delighted to say to that section of the Australian people that has made such an enormous contribution to building the modern Australia that not only can we afford to pay a dividend to them out of good economic management and a recognition of the esteem in which the rest of the Australian community holds them but also we are able to recognise the very important fact - I think it is a fact that all members on this side of the House are aware of - that, although low interest rates are very good for home buyers and for small business, they are not always so welcome to people who are living off the interest income of their investments. That is one of the reasons why these measures will be widely welcomed by self-funded retirees. The benefits will be very significant in terms of not only the increases in the tax-free threshold but also the extension of the Commonwealth health card to another 50,000 retired Australians and the $300 benefit, which will go not only to full and part pensioners but to others. It is in every respect a very, very important recognition of the contribution that older Australians have made. Of course, it comes on top of many other measures that we have introduced. There is no section of the Australian community that has benefited more than older Australians from the measures this government took to restore private health insurance in Australia. Private health insurance was virtually destroyed by the former Labor government. They ran it down. It was bleeding to death when we came into government. We were heading towards a level of about 30 per cent of people with private health insurance; it is now in the order of 45 per cent. I am also proud to say that in this budget, as well as recognising the restoration of private health insurance, we have injected hundreds of millions of dollars into the further strengthening of the Medicare system. We have put money into treating mental illness, diabetes, cervical cancer and asthma - conditions that affect many Australian families. Something in the order of two million Australians are affected by asthma. So, in so many ways, this is a budget that delivers benefits to a cross-section of the Australian community. The delivery of those benefits is possible only because we have run the economy well over the last five years. If we had not run the economy well over the last five years, if the Treasurer had not done such a good job over the last five years, we would not now be in a position to deliver these benefits to the Australian people. I think the budget is warmly welcomed, and I think that there is very good reason for the good reception it has received from the Australian people.</DOC>

 - Can I remind the House that on 1 July last year the government increased all pensions by four per cent and it has been maintaining a two per cent real increase - that is, over and above price rises and price rises which include tax effects. We did that because we were mindful of the way in which the Labor Party cheated older Australians in 1993. In 1993 the Labor Party put up all wholesale sales tax rates. They put one rate up from 10 to 12, another up from 20 to 22 and another up from 30 to 32. They stole back income tax cuts. They lifted petrol excise. And the compensation that was given to pensioners was - nothing. Nothing! Not only did the government increase the pension and maintain it in excess of the cost of living, in addition to the dollar for dollar bonuses which the government paid from 1 July; out of this year's budget we pay to all pensioners and part-pensioners a bonus of $300 - 2.2 million Australians and a bonus of $300. But I must say that I am confused. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been out on radio over the last 24 hours saying that he thinks the budget surplus should be larger, yet his first question today is, `Why didn't you spend more of it?' He thinks the budget surplus is not large enough, but then he gets up and says, `Why didn't you spend some more of it?' This is a party with not a policy shred in its bones. It wants to say that it is in favour of budget surpluses, it criticises us for not spending enough and it wants to roll back the tax base. Put the three of them together and you have a configuration that could be thought up only by Beazley and Crean.When the previous question was asked, I asked one of my colleagues a thought that came into my head. Labor's proposition, I think, was this: `Seeing as the budget surplus this year is $2.3 billion, why didn't you give a larger dividend to pensioners - larger than $300?' I asked myself this question: what dividend do you think pensioners could have been paid out of a $10 billion deficit? The last Labor Party budget was a $10 billion deficit. No wonder there was no bonus to pensioners, no wonder there was no increase, no wonder there was no cut in income taxes - the income taxes which had been put into l-a-w - and no wonder there was no compensation. You do not pay a benefit out of a $10 billion deficit. Before this government came to office, we did not have arguments about the size of surpluses; there quite simply were not any. The question was: how big would the deficits be?</DOC>

 - The budget is in surplus in the next financial year, with a budgeted forecast cash surplus of $1.5 billion, the fifth consecutive surplus, the largest run of surplus budgets since before the Whitlam government. We are undoing the damage that was done by the Whitlam government - I think now generally acknowledged as Australia's worst economic managers - and we are now going back to record some budget outcomes that we had not seen since the 1960s.As this House well knows, in its last five budgets the Labor Party accumulated $80 billion worth of debt. Let me just put this in context as to how you accumulate debt. The first thing you do is you run a deficit - that is, you spend more than your revenues. Then the Labor Party sold assets. But that still was not enough to cover the deficit. Then they went out, after selling assets, and borrowed on financial markets $80 billion. They expended the whole of the proceeds of their asset sales - back in the days when you were pro privatisation, Old Tiger - of the privatisation but still could not balance the budget and still went to the financial markets and borrowed $80 billion.One of the proudest achievements of this government is that, by the end of the forecast financial year, we will have repaid $60 billion of Labor's $80 billion debt. That produces for the budget an interest saving of $4 billion a year, and that $4 billion can now be reinvested in tax reductions, it can be reinvested in the health system, it can be reinvested in building a better defence for Australia, it can be reinvested in strengthening our borders against plant and animal disease and it can be reinvested for pensioners and older Australians. Because this government did the work, we can now reinvest for the future. But I want to say this: having paid off $60 billion of Labor's $80 billion debt, we are only three-quarters of the way there. There is still more work to be done, and this government intends to do it, to deliver good outcomes for the Australian people. </DOC>

 - I assume the question is based on a notional application of the measures announced by the Treasurer last night in relation to self-funded retirees and taxation. The member nods. Also, as I heard the question, it was in relation to a hypothetical example of somebody on $80,000 of income. The member may have overlooked that the increased rebate announced last night phases out for a couple at $58,244. Therefore, your example is wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. The government's income tax cuts mean that a worker on average wages, who under Labor's tax system used to pay a top marginal tax rate of 43 cents in the dollar, now pays a top marginal tax rate of only 30 cents in the dollar. That is a reduction from 43c to 30c. I do not know why, but the Labor Party, for some reason, believe that average workers should pay 43 cents in the dollar tax on every additional dollar that they earn. We do not. We think that people who are going out there and working hard ought to get the rewards of their effort. Isn't that a great thing for average workers? They can go from $20,000 to $50,000 and never face a marginal tax rate above 30 per cent.The tax reform that was also announced last night for self-funded retirees of age pension age and for age pensioners cuts their tax bills and means that individuals need not pay tax or the Medicare levy until they get to $20,000. I want to put this in context. Before this government was elected, if you were a self-funded retiree, your tax-free threshold was $5,400; you started paying tax after $5,400. As a result of the measures which were announced last night, if you are a single income self-funded retiree of age pension age, you start paying tax above $20,000. I do not know why the Labor Party had it in for self-funded retirees in the way that it did. The Labor Party had a mind-set against people who used to fund their own retirement. The Labor Party - because of its socialist origin, no doubt - resented those people who had funded their own retirement and wanted to tax them and to penalise them. It resented people who were earning average wages. But in last night's budget we increased the tax-free threshold for senior Australians, both age pensioners and those of age pension age. We cut the company tax rate from 34 per cent to 30 per cent and we abolished financial institutions duty. You now no longer need to pay tax when you put money into a bank account or pay a mortgage or a credit card. We abolished stamp duty on listed shares. We are refunding excess imputation credits. We introduced new capital gains tax concessions for listed investment companies and we are bringing about the new small business taxation system.I was speaking to one of our friends in the media last night, who said to me, `This tax cut for self-funded retirees applies back to 1 July last year; that's a bit tricky, isn't it?' I said, `Tricky is not when you backdate tax cuts; tricky is when you put tax cuts into l-a-w.' The difference between Labor and the coalition is that Labor believes in tax cuts which are l-a-w. This government believes in tax cuts which are n-o-w - now - paid from 1 July and eligible to self-funded retirees as soon as they put in their tax return. </DOC>

 - I would remind both the member for Lilley and the House that I was very careful in the answer that I gave. I looked at the member for Lilley and said that I assumed that his question was based upon the measures for self-funded retirees, and he nodded assent. He nodded that it was based on self-funded retirees. I was not in the budget lockup last night and I repeat the answer that I gave. The answer that I gave was that, as a result of the measures introduced in relation to self-funded retirees, there is a phase-out of $58,244 and therefore in the example quoted -  - I repeat that the answer I gave was based upon the measures in relation to self-funded retirees. As to the application of taxation cuts introduced last year, self-evidently a person on $80,000 has a tax cut.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I note with interest that the National Farmers Federation and Agforce, in highlighting the feelings that they had about the budget, went first to what they described as `prudent economic management'. They went first up to the issue of us having retired debt and of not having to fork out vast amounts of taxpayers' dollars to service interest on debt. It is interesting that they should have done so, but when you stop and think about why, it is quite easy to see why they have done that. The secret to lower interest rates in particular lies in fiscal commonsense and good management. Since 1995 the interest rate reductions, which, as the Treasurer has often pointed to, have been of great value to, say, homebuyers, are saving Australia's farmers probably well over $1 billion a year - over $1 billion a year that is not leaving the farm sector, let alone the small business and the home buying communities in rural and regional Australia. That is there for their economic advantage. At the same time, we are seeing an improvement in the terms of trade for agriculture - the first I can remember - where prices are rising faster than costs. This is, again, a reflection on economic management. Indeed, as the Minister for Trade reminds me, exports are now higher than our imports - again, something we have not seen for a very long time. All of the $3 billion or so of new expenditure items that have been welcomed in this budget package have been made against the backdrop of prudent financial management. In other words, there is no red ink all over the place; we are still well and truly in the black with a surplus. These new funding measures are valuable and have been widely welcomed. They include $163 million for improved telecommunications, mobile phone coverage, better Internet access and higher Internet speeds. Around $1.8 billion has been allocated to roads, and $110 million for the Alice to Darwin railway alone in the area of rail. There is further assistance to the dairy industry. Very significantly, there is an expansion of our rural health package for doctors and GPs, and now nurses as well - $130-odd million to help with more nurses in rural and regional areas. In education, there has been a very significant increase in the number of Commonwealth funded undergraduate student places for regional higher education. These measures are in addition to other valuable programs - Networking the Nation, Roads to Recovery, Regional Solutions, the rural transaction centres and Agriculture Advancing Australia. The National Heritage Trust has been extended by another $1 billion. There are measures in the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. It is probably not altogether surprising that it has been not only the NFF, Agforce and other rural bodies that have welcomed the budget in very strong terms. The federal president of the Isolated Children's Parents Association, Megan McNicholl, particularly welcomed the increase in undergraduate places, the rural nursing scholarships, the $22 million for the CAP - the country areas program - the improved telecommunications access, the continuation of that very important service provided by the rural financial counsellors and the $65 million to improve access of remote families to quality child care.The member for Mitchell had a letter, which he passed on to me, from the CEO of Charter Freightlines and Storage Pty Ltd. The CEO wrote to the government this morning and we asked whether he would mind us recording for posterity his remarks, and he said, `No.' He said:The investment this government is making in road transport, be it in roads or operating costs, goes a long way to maintaining this country's competitive advantage. He said:This foresight is something which has been lacking in the past but which has been brought into full focus by this government.I was asked about alternative policies. In this whole area of regional and rural policies we have nothing from the ALP - nothing at all. There are no alternatives. We had all of those promises, when the member for Batman took over from the member for Dickson, about regional policies being fully developed and being in the drawer ready for release. Of course, when he got there he said that in fact the drawer was empty - there was nothing there. And it remains the case. We can only go on their record and the very few things that they have said. I am looking at some of the things I have just touched on. I could challenge the Labor Party to commit to continue the Roads to Recovery program. That is the one they called the `boondoggle'. They could continue the Black Spots Road Safety Program, the one they axed in government. They could continue funding for the National Heritage Trust. That is the one they said is a rort. They could also give us a commitment to continue to improve telecommunications in rural and regional Australia, because all we know in that area from what they did was that they shut down mobile phone services.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is absolutely committed to a world-class and safe public hospital system, and there are four items in the budget that are great news to anyone who needs or works in the public hospital system. The first is that we deliver on the fourth year of the Australian health care agreements with $6.7 billion of funding to the states - a record amount - a $1 billion increase and a 28 per cent increase over the life of the agreement over and above what Labor negotiated in 1993. We also allow states to retain very significant additional moneys because of not proceeding with the clawback provisions of the Australian health care agreements, which will mean about $1 billion a year to them.The second item for hospitals is the funding of the Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care. Adverse events in hospitals are a major problem right around the world. No country has worked out how to deal with them adequately. I am pleased that the former President of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, Professor Bruce Barraclough, is chairing such a council. We have given a commitment of $25 million over four years to make that council work. It will be involved in performance measurement and improvement initiatives in the public hospital system, legislative reforms and design of services for safer care.The third item for hospitals in the budget is an extension of the National Hospital Demonstration Program, which was designed to finish on 30 June this year. This has been a great success in driving change in public hospital management, something that is very difficult to do in a federal system. We will be providing $7.4 million for projects in 24 hospitals and this will continue work with waiting list management, theatre management and other things to make hospitals run better and be able to treat more people. The final initiative for hospitals is $16 million to fund the first two years of HealthConnect. HealthConnect is a world-class innovation for highly secure patient information to be transferred so that a person does not need to have a new medical history taken every time they see a new different health care provider. This is an enormously difficult area where a number of countries are working on similar projects. Australia is leading the world in this area, and this commitment of funding will ensure that the Health Insurance Commission continues to do that, with particular benefit for people at the hospital-GP interface. These are basically practical solutions to problems in our health care system. They build on the five previous budgets of the Howard government. Each of those budgets has made a significant contribution to ensuring that we remain at the forefront of world-class health care. </DOC>

 - I want every member of the government, and indeed every member of the opposition, to note that this is the totality of the devastating attack on the budget by the Leader of the Opposition. A self-funded retiree is normally regarded as a person who looks after himself or herself, who is of retirement age, which for a man is normally regarded as being around 65 and for a woman in her early sixties. I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition is talking about. I don't think he does. It is very plain that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand how a tax rebate operates. Otherwise he and the member for Lilley would not have got into the ridiculous mess they did with the last three questions. I do not think he understands the true definition of a self-funded retiree. You would expect that from a party which, when it was in government, showed an absolute contempt for older Australians. That question from the Leader of the Opposition provokes me to refer to a favourite piece of reading of mine - Australian Labor Party, Election 1993, Policies for Older Australians. One of the policies said:Labor's commitment to removing all age and service pensioners from the tax system by 1995 - Listen to that - `all age and service pensioners'. It gets better as it goes on:will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point. Labor is working on the details of implementing this proposal and believes that the next step should involve consultation with input from community pensioner and retiree organisations through a discussion paper to be released this year.That was before the election. On 18 March 1993 - that was five days after the election - in one of Joe Dawkins's more memorable contributions to political integrity, this is what he had to say:Look, that is something which of course the Government would want to review. We haven't got any definite undertakings about that and basically I think it was an undertaking given at a much earlier stage.What about six weeks earlier? Listen to this - this is the piece de resistance. He says:It is certainly not an undertaking we have renewed - you can be certain of that - and I certainly don't feel under any obligation to follow through with it.But we get the explanation the following day. The Australian Financial Review solemnly reported:Labor advisers say the commitment was included in the policy platform by mistake.So much for Labor's care about older Australians. I say to the retired people of the Australian community: if you want justice, look to the coalition; if you want a fair go, look to the coalition; if you want respect for the contribution you have made to the Australian nation, look to the coalition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his interest in quarantine issues. This particular initiative by the federal government in last night's budget certainly builds on our excellent record in improving Australia's quarantine services. In previous budgets we have increased resources for border activities by 50 per cent and added to the number of staff available for that purpose by about two-thirds. That contrasts very strongly with Labor's last years in office, when they allowed quarantine services to run down. They gave a very low priority to protecting Australia's disease free status and put at risk our nation's reputation in that regard. But this government has turned that around. In last night's budget we saw the biggest boost in quarantine expenditure in our nation's history. It is particularly appropriate that we should take that kind of action when Australians have been noticing the impact of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom. It has had a devastating effect on farming and the UK economy - with something like $12 billion in lost production for UK farmers. The tourist industry estimates it will lose $7 billion this year as a result of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK. At risk, if we had a disease of this nature in Australia, would be our $15 billion worth of export markets, particularly in the livestock industries. It is therefore essential that we maintain a strong barrier and a strong protective network to keep our country clean and green.So over the next four years there will be almost $600 million provided to boost quarantine services. It is proposed that the number of AQIS and Customs border staff be increased by more than 1,200. The number of dog detector teams in use at airports, international mail exchanges and seaports will triple to 98. AQIS will acquire another 49 X-ray machines to bring the total number in service to 58. There will also be $69 million devoted to modifications at airports around Australia to accommodate this new equipment and staff and also to upgrade the mail centres in Sydney and Melbourne and construct a new international mail centre in Sydney. Once these measures are in place, all cargo and mail entering Australia will be inspected or X-rayed - 100 per cent. All arriving air passengers will be screened and in most cases their luggage will be inspected or X-rayed by AQIS officers. Indeed, we will achieve 100 per cent rates of inspection or opening of baggage at most airports for 24 hours a day.These announcements massively upgrade our quarantine capabilities and help protect our vital clean and green image - one of our most precious national assets. It is the sort of thing that can be delivered when sound economic policy is in place - something Labor could never have done, even if they had wanted to. The reality is that when they were in government, in spite of their record deficits, they allowed quarantine services to run down. They gave these services a low priority. Fortunately for Australian agriculture, there has been a change of government and a change of attitude towards quarantine.</DOC>

 - The Social Security Act defines eligibility age for the age pension - that is, for retired persons - as 65 for men and 61½ for women. And, as I understand it, it is rising for women. It is rising, I think, as a result of Labor Party legislation, because you took the view that women should not retire or be considered retired at the age of 60. You took the view that, with people living longer, the retirement age for women should be raised to the same as for men, which is 65. You cannot become eligible for the age pension, because you are not considered to be retired and no longer required to go into the work force, until such time as you are 65. That is the qualification for the age pension. A self-funded retiree is a person who is of the same age - somebody who has retired from the work force. In relation to somebody who is below 65, they have never qualified for the age pension - never under the Labor Party. The policy has always been - from the Labor Party and from the coalition - that, until you are 65, you are not considered to be retired from the work force and, therefore, you are not eligible for the age pension. The same rule applies to pensioners and to self-funded retirees. What we did in last night's budget for people who are below 65 - that is, people who do not qualify for the age pension because they are not considered to be of retirement age - was change the assets and income test so that their superannuation is not taken into account in income support. These are people who, under the Labor Party and under the coalition, are considered not to be eligible for the age pension and are therefore eligible -  - for Jobstart and Newstart allowances. The measure that is introduced in relation to them is that their superannuation is excluded from those tests. People who are of retirement age - whether they be a pensioner or a self-funded retiree - as a result of last night's changes have a tax-free threshold of $20,000. If you are a self-funded retiree, under the Australian Labor Party your tax-free threshold was $5,400. The Labor Party said that if you were a self-funded retiree - which they defined as somebody over 65 - you started paying tax at $5,400 but, if you were a pensioner, you did not start paying tax until you had income of $11,000. The Labor Party said, `You should be penalised for being a self-funded retiree.' The Labor Party thought that people who saved for their own retirement and were independent should be penalised. The Labor Party did not like people who saved and looked after themselves. The Labor Party never gave a benefit for people who took out private health insurance. That is because the Labor Party never thought that people who looked after themselves should have some help from the tax system. That is the difference between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties. We value people who save, we reward thrift and we want to encourage independence.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Medicare was designed as a health financing system and, as such, it has done very well. Medicare has had significant shortcomings. Under Medicare, only 53 per cent of our kids were properly immunised and we were having epidemics of measles. Under Medicare, Aboriginal Australians and people in rural Australia missed out on significant parts of health care. Medicare never focused on prevention; in fact, it actively discouraged prevention. It never focused on early intervention and it was not well placed to cope with chronic disease management. We redress that problem in this budget. Expenditure of $290 million over four years will go into treating chronic illness in a way never attempted in this country and not attempted by any other nation previously. We focus, as the honourable member suggests, on diabetes, asthma, mental illness and also cervical cancer.Diabetes is a growing problem in Australia. On average, five people in this chamber will have diabetes; six people in this chamber will have diabetes and not realise that they have it; 25 people in this chamber will develop diabetes during their lifetime. Diabetes has a good-news story, though, because, if it is appropriately managed, the nasty complications are avoided. So, for the first time ever, we will give GPs, who provide 80 per cent of the treatment of diabetes in Australia, incentives to appropriately manage diabetes and to prevent illness happening, and we will support and back this up through divisions of general practice. Asthma affects two million Australians, 17 per cent of whom have moderate to severe symptoms. It is the biggest single cause of hospital admission of Australian children, yet asthma is dramatically undertreated in Australia. In the budget, we propose what we call the `three-plus steps' to asthma management, which will involve at least three separate visits to the doctor, involving assessment, a care plan and regular review of the individual with their doctor, because asthma can be largely self-managed and an enormous amount of illness can be prevented. Cervical cancer is treated variably in Australia. It is estimated that 90 per cent of cervical cancer is completely preventable, yet only 50 per cent is prevented in Australia. Thirty-six per cent of women in Australia do not get regular pap smears. This is particularly prevalent in women from non-English-speaking backgrounds, women from rural Australia and indigenous women. We will be rewarding GPs who do appropriate cervical cancer screening of women at high risk and we will also be rewarding GPs for the overall level of cervical cancer screening in their practices. In this way, Medicare will actually be paying doctors for outcomes. We tried this with the immunisation incentives -  it worked. It will also work with cervical cancer and, in the reasonable and foreseeable future, will give us one of the best rates of cervical cancer screening in the world.Finally, the honourable member mentioned mental illness. Mental illness costs Australia in lost productivity around $5 billion a year and by the year 2020 it will be the second highest burden of illness in Australia; and yet mental illness is dramatically undertreated in Australia. We propose to make a very substantial change to that with the package in last night's budget. We will reward general practitioners for appropriate counselling for mental illness, by introducing a new Medicare rebate that rewards doctors who are appropriately trained and undertake counselling. We will have a substantial education program amongst GPs, because not many GPs are properly trained in non-pharmacological methods, particularly cognitive behavioural therapy; and, for the first time ever, we will give GPs access to allied health services - not just psychiatrists but also psychologists - that will enable the public to get access to a range of services they have never had before. This will remove the significant barriers that exist in Australia to early identification and appropriate early intervention into mental illness. It will build on Medicare and will change it from a system simply focused on money to one focused on preventing illness.</DOC>

 - The budget papers disclose some -  - No. I read them afterwards. That is more than you have done. -  - Yes. I can actually read, Martin. It is more than your leader can do. He does not understand a rebate. I say to the honourable member for Dickson that it is the case that the budget papers show a level of unemployment which is slightly higher than at present. There is no backing or filling about that. It is, of course, dramatically lower than it was when you were in office. It always passes strange, the stridency and confidence with which members of the Labor Party frontbench stand up here day after day and ask questions breathlessly about unemployment. When your leader was minister for unemployment, it went to 11 per cent. It went to a post-Depression high. It was the highest level for 60 years in this country, the worst level: you could stretch from somewhere in Victoria to Townsville the number of people who were out of work. I think the essence of the question from the member for Dickson was: if there is a slightly worsening employment situation, what are the measures to respond? Well, the measures to respond are that, firstly, you have a strongly growing economy - and all the indications are that, coming off the relative aberrant nature of the December quarter figure, there is plenty of evidence that the Australian economy is rebounding. I am sure that the member for Dickson read that material in the budget papers last night. I would venture the view to the member for Dickson that the measures that we introduced within two days of getting the December quarter account figures, to stimulate the housing industry, will do more than any labour market programs in the short term to reduce unemployment. In the end, generating more jobs through greater economic activity is the best antidote to unemployment. But seeing that the member for Dickson has asked me a question, I take the opportunity of reminding the member for Dickson that this government has done something that no Labor government did. The Whitlam government did not do it; the Hawke government did not do it; the Keating government did not do it. This government has done something that no postwar Labor government has ever dreamt of doing, and that is to tackle the long-term problem of restructuring the welfare system. What this government is proposing to do -  - under the stewardship of my colleagues the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business is to develop a culture which encourages people to seek work opportunities. We have in fact achieved far more than you achieved in relation to reductions of long-term unemployment. We have achieved reductions in youth unemployment and we have achieved reductions at every level.One of the things that Labor frontbenchers find very hard to accept is that, in those areas which you always regarded as your own -  that is, things relating to care of the disadvantaged; things relating to decent wages for working people; things relating to helping the unemployed - we have done far better than you ever did. -  - I know it really does cut to the quick on these things. I watch the expressions on their faces, on even the seemingly benign member for Batman, whenever I trot out those real wage figures. I remind the member for Batman that, under 13 years of Labor government, you boasted about cutting the wages of the workers; whereas, under this government, real wages have risen, interest rates have fallen, unemployment has fallen, we are tackling reform not only of the tax system and the labour market system but also of the welfare system; and we are doing it with the cooperation of the welfare sector. We value their contribution to Australian society, just as we value the contribution of older Australians to the building of our community.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Herbert for his excellent question. I know he has a passionate commitment to all Australians, particularly older Australians. I would like to endorse some of our magnificent achievements for older Australians last night - in particular, that 1.8 million pensioners will this year receive a $300 payment up front. David Deans, the chief executive of the National Seniors Association, said today on Perth radio:We are very positive about the budget. Self-funded retirees benefits are very positive. The bonus payment to people on the age pension is again a very positive thing.This is in addition to the savings bonus that we paid to over 2.1 million older Australians this year, and we are expecting more. The average payment for those on pensions is over $734 and for self-funded retirees the average payment of the supplementary bonus is just under $1,765. For retirees there is an increase in the tax-free threshold, which will also benefit pensioners. This is recognition of self-funded retirees particularly in that, if they wish to work more, they will save because of the less taxation that they will pay. You have to ask yourself: what is the Labor Party policy on older Australians? As was articulated before, their policy, particularly on self-funded retirees, when they came into government in the early eighties was to take away any incentive for private health insurance. They were the government that introduced capital gains tax, which had a major impact on self-funded retirees. It is this government that has helped reduce that, and of course it is this government that has provided tax cuts and also raised the tax-free threshold not just for retirees but also for pensioners. What would pensioners have got if the Australian Labor Party had been in government? They would be receiving $22 less, because it was this government - the Liberal-National Party government - that linked pensions to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, and this year from 1 July single pensions are up $30 and couples pensions are up $50.You have to ask yourself: what is the Labor Party policy? They do not have a policy. Their policy to compensate older Australians was zero when they introduced the wholesale sales tax. Their policy to compensate self-funded retirees was zero when they took away private health insurance. You have to ask yourself: what are the tactics of the Australian Labor Party today? The member for Lilley - you might be Swan by name, but you are behaving like a goose today!</DOC>

 - The person who asked the question would know all about consistency when it comes to privatisation. There are plenty of members of the old Commonwealth Bank Officers Association who still have those letters written in blood in the early 1990s about how Labor would turn in its grave -  -  - The government's position on Telstra is that we, first of all, fix things in the bush. You do not proceed with the full privatisation until you fix things in the bush. I am very pleased to say to rural Australia, seeing that the Leader of the Opposition has asked the question, that we have now advanced a very long way towards fixing communications challenges in the bush. There has been a dramatic improvement. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that that has been made possible - once again, in the face of total opposition from the Labor Party - because so much of it has been financed out of part sales of Telstra to date. The budget papers and the budget figuring in relation to Telstra reflect the priority that has been stated by the minister, been stated by me, been stated by the Deputy Prime Minister and been stated by many other people -  and that is that, first of all, you fix the things identified by Besley, you improve the communications infrastructure in the bush, and only when that is completed do you turn your attention to a further sale of shares in Telstra. This has been our position for well over two, perhaps now up to almost three, years. I contrast it to the bobbing and weaving, could I put it that way, of the Leader of the Opposition. When he was in government he said one thing on privatisation before an election and after he had scrambled back into office he said exactly the other thing. I well remember a conversation the Leader of the Opposition had with me on the eve of a budget in which he was soliciting the support of the then opposition to pass some privatisation legislation through the parliament. He said, `Can we count on the opposition to support this legislation?' And I said, `Yes, you can count on the support of the opposition because we have always supported the privatisation of this particular asset.' He was worried about the Democrats, but he was probably worried about his own backbench, so he needed the support of the opposition. Unlike the Labor Party, when we were in opposition and we saw a good policy we supported it. We supported it in the national interest, as we supported the floating of the Australian dollar, as we supported reform of the tariff system. By contrast, the Labor Party has opposed every attempt made by this government to reform and improve and strengthen the Australian economy. It will forever be to the credit of the coalition that, despite the guerrilla tactics of the Australian Labor Party, we have succeeded in the last five years in dramatically strengthening the Australian economy, to the benefit of the Australian entire population.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question and acknowledge the interest she has in the welfare and care that we give to veterans in her electorate. There was some $440 million in veterans care entitlements contained in the budget papers last night. The Treasurer announced in his speech last night that the government would be paying a one-off ex gratia payment of $25,000 to prisoners of war of Japan who were alive on 1 January this year. It will also be made available to the war widows of prisoners of war of Japan and to the civilian detainees and internees who were prisoners of the Japanese during the Second World War.No amount of compensation could ever compensate for the horrific treatment of Australian prisoners of war at the hands of the Japanese during the Second World War. I am reminded when considering the survivors of the prisoner of war camps, and I want to record in the parliament today, that the sole remaining survivor of the horrific Sandakan death march, Owen Campbell, who lives in the electorate of Longman, will be one of the recipients of this ex gratia payment of $25,000. I mention that because, as those who know the history of the Sandakan death march will understand, all but six on that death march died or were killed by the Japanese, and those six only survived because they were able to escape.The other measures that were in the budget last night relate to our war widows who had remarried prior to 1984. A recommendation came forward in 1984 to allow those war widows who had previously lost that entitlement because they had remarried to have that entitlement reinstated. The Labor Party did adopt part of that recommendation in that they allowed those who remarried after 1984 to keep their war widows entitlement. That has created two classes of war widows: those who remarried prior to 1984 and those who remarried after 1984. We are fixing up this injustice, and that will help some 3,500 war widows who have been denied access to their war widows pension simply because they had remarried prior to 1984. They will now receive this pension entitlement. It also will apply to war widows from the conflicts of Vietnam and Korea who had married prior to 1984. So it is not just those widows of the Second World War or perhaps in some cases the First World War; it is about justice for our war widows. It is this government that is fixing up an injustice which has been here far too long. Another initiative announced in the budget last night is full access to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for veterans from British, Commonwealth and Allied forces who have lived in Australia for more than 10 years and are aged 70 or more. Some of those veterans who have made Australia home have come from Britain, New Zealand, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland, Belgium, France, the former Yugoslavia, Greece, Norway and the United States of America. All these British, Commonwealth and Allied veterans served shoulder to shoulder with our service men and women during the Second World War. Many of them have made Australia their home. It is only fair that they have the same access to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as our Australian service men and women. That will benefit some 47,000 British, Commonwealth and Allied veterans. It is once again about justice and equity for those British, Commonwealth and Allied veterans.So, Mr Speaker, if you want justice for prisoners of war, it is the Liberal and National parties that are going to deliver. If you want justice for war widows who remarried prior to 1984, it is the Liberal and National parties that are going to deliver for them. And if you want justice for the British, Commonwealth and Allied veterans, it is the Liberal and National parties, once again, that are going to care for our veterans and deliver justice for them.</DOC>

 - As usual, I will check precisely what I said to Neil Mitchell. I will find out precisely whether the construction put on it by the Leader of the Opposition is correct. Having said that, my view, the view of the government and the view of many people in the medical profession is that people who could be threatened or challenged by heart disease would do well to observe more strict dietary habits and would do well to engage in more exercise.  -  - I do not think that there is any doubt about that. - The point ought to be made that, contrary to what is being said by some critics of the government, these drugs are not being taken off the PBS list at all. All that is happening is that doctors are being enjoined to ensure that the prescription of drugs is preceded by a little bit of advice about diet and exercise. - I think it is a thoroughly sound approach to encourage people to engage in better dietary habits and a little bit of exercise, as well as treating them with drugs. I think most Australians would agree with what I have said.</DOC>

 - There is no group in Australia that has benefited more from the economic policies of this government over the last five years as have Australian families. It has been a combination of a number of things. To start with, we have generated 825,000 more jobs. That is a mighty contribution and is different from the 11 per cent unemployment that the Leader of the Opposition gave us when he was the minister for employment.  - He should have been called the minister for unemployment! You always know when the Leader of the Opposition has a problem: he keeps interjecting while I am giving an answer. -  - Not only have we generated 825,000 more jobs but we have actually presided over rises in real income. You boasted about cutting wages; we are proud about increasing wages. We have been able to increase wages, without there being an inflationary wages break-out, because our industrial relations policies have delivered higher productivity to Australian workplaces. We have therefore been able to increase nominal wages without there being an outbreak of inflation. That is a direct result of the industrial relations policy that the Labor Party is pledged to destroy if it were elected as the government of Australia. Male average weekly ordinary time earnings in the March quarter 1996, when this government was elected to office, were $706.60; in the March quarter 2001 they were $856.60. That is an increase of 21.2 per cent. Disposable earnings have risen by 26.9 per cent and real disposable earnings have risen by 13.8 per cent.This is not only due to the fact that real wages have risen at a faster rate under our government than was the case under Labor, it is not only due to the fact that there are more people in work, but also due to the fact that the most important, largest recurring expense of the average Australian family, particularly of younger families, is paying the monthly mortgage bill on the housing loan and that, as a result of the economic policies of this government, those housing mortgages are consuming $300 a month less than they were in March 1996. Of course, if you reach back to the time under the former government, interest rates were 17 per cent for housing, they were often 18 and 19 per cent for small business and they were often 21 and 22 per cent if you were a farmer and were borrowing on a commercial bill. But even if you take the most charitable comparison with the Australian Labor Party - which is actually March 1996 - you find that the average mortgage now costs $300 a month less. So you add that to the increases in real wages, and you add that to the improvements in relation to child care.Child care is 15 per cent cheaper in Australia as a result of the introduction of the new taxation system. As I go around the Australian community, I find not only parents but also child-care operators thanking the government for their enlightened policy in relation to child care. In the taxation system, we have greatly increased family benefits, we have cut their taxes and we have given a new and better deal for Australia's single income families that were absolutely dudded by the taxation policy of the former government. So if you add all of those together - 825,000 more jobs, significant cuts in income tax, cheaper child care, significant reductions in mortgage interest rates - you find that there is no group in the Australian community that has fared better under the policies of this government than have average Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because, as was announced in the budget two nights ago, the government will be paying a $300 one-off bonus to pensioners and anybody over 65 years of age who is on another kind of pension, including a service pension. So it applies to people who are over 65, as was made entirely clear in my budget speech, as was made entirely clear in the budget papers, as was made entirely clear by the government - in fact, so entirely clear by the government, as I recall, the opposition has been criticising it because it is a one-off payment.  - Mr Speaker, can I -  -  - Mr Speaker, I thank you for all the good exercise you have been giving my back by making me stand up and sit down. And I thank the Labor Party for its great interest in the $300 pensioner bonus, because we know that the Australian Labor Party, when it increased every wholesale sales tax in this country, when it took away income tax cuts and when it put up petrol indexation by 5c, offered to the pensioners of Australia not one dollar - nothing. Out of the dividends of good economic policy, this government has been able to offer a $300 bonus, and I can inform the House that that law has now passed the Senate and this sum will be paid next month. Every Australian pensioner, every Australian part-pensioner will next month be receiving a $300 bonus, a dividend for good economic policy. And it was the Liberal and National parties that paid it.</DOC>

 - In the measures announced on budget night in relation to the changes to the tax-free threshold, from memory - and I will obviously check the precise figures after question time and if I have to vary them in any way I will - the number of people assisted from the change in the tax-free threshold is about 350,000. The number of people who gain from an extension of the eligibility for the health card is 50,000. So that is 400,000 to start with. I suppose it depends a bit on what your definition of a `self-funded retiree' is? I suppose in theory somebody who is aged 35 could be a self-funded retiree, somebody aged 45, somebody aged 55, somebody aged 62 - people in the frontbench of the Labor Party!  - The Treasurer and I both pointed out yesterday that, when you speak of a `self-funded retiree', the normal understanding of that expression is a person who is self-supporting who is of pension age or beyond. Of course there are some people below pension age too who have retired, for whatever combination of reasons, and are self-funded. I would point out to the member that, as the Treasurer pointed out, one of the measures in the budget that assisted people between the age of 55 and, in the case of men, 65, in the case of women, 61½, was the changes in relation to superannuation and the assets test. But the definition that is normally employed -  -  - I do not remember the Labor Party ever adopting a different definition, because you never did anything for self-funded retirees. - Maybe tonight. Tonight's the night.  - Not only tonight are we going to hear from the Labor Party about what they would do to help the self-funded retired of Australia, including presumably anybody from age 21 through to age 65 -  - They are all going to get a benefit, are they? - Gee, this will be worth waiting for. Not only are we going to get that; perhaps we will get details of roll-back. The long retreat from roll-back began on the front page of the Australian this morning and also on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald. Maybe tonight the Leader of the Opposition will fill out the detail of what Stephen Conroy alluded to. Courtesy of Stephen Conroy, we know that one of the options now before the Labor Party is to increase taxes in order to fund roll-back, because interviewed on The World Today Stephen Conroy held open the option of increasing income tax, increasing indirect taxes -  - `What rubbish!' the Leader of the Opposition says. So you have the opportunity tonight. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: he has a golden opportunity tonight - and that is a word printed on the front page of the newspapers quite a lot in relation to the budget - to say to the Australian people exactly what he would do. He has a golden opportunity to tell us about roll-back, he has a golden opportunity to identify those government spending programs a Labor government would axe and he has a golden opportunity to explain to the Australian people what Stephen Conroy alluded to, and that is what taxes a Labor government would increase in order to fund roll-back.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question, because in the budget which was brought down two nights ago the government delivered the fifth consecutive surplus budget. We have not had five consecutive surplus budgets since pre-Whitlam days -  since the Labor Party destroyed Australia's economy back in the early 1970s. Members of the House will be familiar with the fact that I keep close to my pillow one of my favourite newspaper articles, and I polish it up every night. It was the Financial Review of 14 August 2000 when, in a rare discussion of economic policy, the shadow Treasurer was asked this question:Q: ... you will make a promise that you will deliver a bigger surplus than they do?A: That would be our intention.From that day on he became known as `Bigger Surplus' Crean, or BS Crean - a man who was committing the Labor Party to larger surpluses. Presumably, BS Crean thinks that $1.5 billion is not enough - that he would have delivered a bigger surplus. The Leader of the Opposition, on the other hand, has been out all morning saying not that he believes in bigger surpluses - no, no, no - but that he believes in more spending. He has been calling for all pensioners to be given $1,000. To give 2.2 million pensioners $300 costs $660 million; to give 2.2 million pensioners $1,000 costs $2.2 billion - according to my figures, an additional net promise of $1.6 billion.I was musing to myself during the day how could the Labor Party on the one hand pledge itself to larger surpluses and on the other hand call for increased spending - how could they have bigger surpluses and more spending? And the third way has been outlined by the shadow minister for financial services. He was speaking at a forum this morning and he was asked this question:In order to fund this knowledge nation that Labor keeps talking about, would you be willing to increase revenues in some way?Good question - and it was a school student that asked it. Listen to this:Senator Conroy: Look, we've got some hard decisions to make over the next couple of months. I mean, I don't think we can run away from the fact that there will be hard decisions. We have to prioritise how we are going to fund our spending initiatives and we are going to have to make choices between are we going to cut programs, are we going to increase some taxes?Some hard choices to be made and a hard choice to be made in the Leader of the Opposition's reply tonight. Are you going to cut programs? Are you going to increase some taxes? I want to come back to one point on this, because I think it is important that every member of the House know the Labor Party's secret agenda on increasing taxes, and I would ask every journalist in Australia to read the speech that was made by the now Leader of the Opposition in this House on 28 September -  - He is panicking. I do not think I have ever before seen anybody rise to the dispatch box - and not make a point of order - just to do an interjection. I do not think I have ever seen anybody rise to the dispatch box to make an interjection; nor of course have we seen the exaggerated laughter that we are now seeing from the Leader of the Opposition - psychobabble followed by exaggerated laughter. But I would ask the press of Australia and the members of this House to read the speech given by the now Leader of the Opposition in the House on 28 September 1993. It was a matter of public importance, a discussion in this House as to why the Labor Party, which had run to the 1993 election promising not to increase tax, was justified after the election in taking away income tax cuts, in increasing the petrol excise and in increasing the wholesale sales tax. The Leader of the Opposition said:... Nor is it the fault of this government that that statement was madethat they would not put up taxand that the Leader of the Opposition did not then go out and thump the table and demand to know how the government of the day was going to keep that promise or keep to that particular mark. He did not ask what taxes the government was going to raise or what tax cuts it was not going to put through. The fact that those opposite did not, day in, day out - like any halfway decent opposition - go through those propositions ... is not our fault.In other words, he said he was justified in increasing those taxes because the opposition - we were in opposition then - did not go in, day in, day out, making sure that we nailed them down on their tax rises. I tell you: we are not going to fail this time. We are going to, day in, day out, make sure that we nail you on your secret plans for tax rises. We are going to, go, day in, day out, to know what Senator Conroy means when he says `increasing taxes'. You are not going to get away again with the deceit that you practised in 1993. You are going to be held accountable.  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and I acknowledge that she is a great champion for the people that she represents in their pursuit of greater economic opportunity and better social services outcomes. Over the last five years the Liberal-National Party government has given back to rural and regional Australia the opportunities, the services and the future that Labor took away. It has been a long haul. There was a lot to do after 13 years - a great deal to be done - and a lot has been done, from lower interest rates to lower inflation. As for those lower interest rates, it is worth reiterating that the four bases points that they are in essence down just since 1995 are worth around $1.2 billion a year to Australia's farmers. Then you look at the other benefits: a waterfront that now works, something that rural Australia has always wanted but that the ALP and its mates said could not be done in this country; lower taxes on transport - very important in the current climate - taken further in the budget the other night; and of course Agriculture - Advance Australia, an $800 million package that took the place of the old rural adjustment scheme, a couple of hundred million dollars. There has been the Natural Heritage Trust, now extended, and the fortressing of Australia against unwanted pests and diseases.As I said, a lot has been done - with more to come - but that actually means that there is a lot to be lost as well. There is a lot, potentially, to be lost. Tonight the Leader of the Opposition must guarantee not to roll back rural and regional Australia. He owes it to rural and regional Australia to tell them what his city-centric party's intentions would be for rural and regional Australia if he were ever to be in a position to have a say. In the end, you can mumble in the abstract about `vision' for only so long. In the end, you can use the word only so many times in a 40-minute budget reply speech. In the end, you actually have to tell people something of what it is that you are going to do. After five years of this opposition, we still have not heard in rural and regional Australia anything at all of what the ALP would do if they were ever in a position to implement a policy for rural and regional Australia. We heard repeatedly from the member for Dickson that she was on the cusp of releasing a policy. When she ceased to be the minister responsible, she said that she had left it all there in the top drawer, ready to be released by the member for Batman. But the member for Batman gave that away, because he said that the top drawer was empty - there was nothing in it.The Leader of the Opposition has revealed his interest in rural and regional Australia: at his major event at the Hobart conference last year, he did not mention regional Australia. So tonight the Leader of the Opposition must demonstrate to regional Australia that he will not roll back on them. Will he guarantee the extension of the Natural Heritage Trust? Will he guarantee Roads to Recovery? Will the opposition continue to expand what we have been doing in telecommunications - mobile phone coverage, which they took away? Will they speed up Internet connections? Will they continue BARN, one of the Networking the Nation programs, which is of great value? Will they commit themselves to the USO and - something that they did not even think of - the customer service guarantee? All of those are actual telecommunications policies. We have not heard a single telecommunications policy for rural and regional Australia from the ALP - not a single positive declaration of what they would do. Will they continue Regional Solutions, partnerships with rural communities as they seek their own best way forward? Will they continue to have more doctors and better services? Will they roll back the GST and reintroduce a raft of hidden taxes like they did in 1993, contrary to what they said they would do? That raises the other question: if they do say something tonight, should we believe them? Will they reintroduce those just when it is becoming apparent that tax reform is contributing to an improved terms of trade outlook for rural and regional Australia? So tonight we will wait in hope. Tonight is the night. How will Simon's promises of bigger surpluses and the Leader of the Opposition's promises of bigger expenditures play out for rural and regional Australia? Which taxes will be increased? Which services will go? What is it going to mean? Tonight is the night when surely we will hear something. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Indeed, I was looking for a piece of paper - it is one they obviously have not found. It is from the budget papers, which explain our policy in relation to Telstra. I might as well put it into Hansard:The Government has committed not to introduce such legislation - in relation to privatisation - until it is satisfied arrangements exist to deliver adequate services, in particular to rural and regional Australia. The Government's immediate priority -  - I repeat:The Government's immediate priority is to get more services into rural and regional areas. At the present time, the Government is not satisfied that such arrangements are in place and believes -  - It continues:more work needs to be done, including in the context of the response to the Telecommunications Service Inquiry into the adequacy of service levels in rural and regional areas.This, of course, raises the only real issue in town, which is: which side of politics in Australia has actually delivered better telecommunications outcomes for rural and regional Australia? It is the Liberal and National parties. The fact is that the spokesman opposite has released 22 press releases in recent months on the opposition's position on telecommunications, and they have all gone to the issue of ownership of Telstra. Not once has he, coming from the leafy suburbs of Perth, reflected any understanding of what rural and regional and remote Australians need in terms of better telecommunications outcomes. Not once have they said anything about how they would achieve them. He would go back to arguing the position of the days when we had a fully publicly owned PMG and many of us on this side of the House had to operate on a party line.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the House would be aware, in the budget two nights ago this government brought forward full input tax credits on all motor vehicles for business. That was the equivalent of a tax cut for business of over $600 million, I believe. That means that businesses in this country can now buy fleet cars and trucks tax free. Let us compare that to the system under the Australian Labor Party. - Under the Australian Labor Party motor vehicles were taxed at 22 per cent. - Mr Speaker, he is probably astounded, as I am, at the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax which cars carried under the Labor Party's tax regime. If you were a business buyer, you paid a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. When this government introduced 10 per cent GST that led to a fall in the cost of vehicles by around seven per cent. That is when you could not claim back the GST, but from 1 July 2001 you can claim back the full GST, meaning that businesses will get a further reduction of around nine per cent in the cost of their vehicles.One of the great things about tax reform is that by spreading the taxation burden we have taken the weight off Australia's manufacturing industry. One of the biggest beneficiaries of tax reform have been the manufacturing industries of Australia. If it is Labor Party policy to roll back the GST and reintroduce wholesale sales tax, the people that would suffer the biggest detriment under such a tax policy would be the manufacturers of Australia. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries said of the budget announcement:We are delighted with the announcement. It is a big boost to all business, big and small.Small businesses that buy cars and vans will all get the effect of this tax reduction. The Motor Trades Association said:This measure will provide a major boost to business, the Australian automotive industry and the motor trades, and to local supplier manufacture.But probably the best words of praise for the decision in the budget on Tuesday night came from the Victorian Treasurer, Mr John Brumby -  - The Victorian Labor Treasurer, Mr John Brumby, said:If you are buying a new car, obviously the benefit of the GST credit will be of value to you. And from Victoria's point of view, given that we have got Toyota and GM and Ford, if we sell more cars, that means more investment, more jobs. We are happy with that.`More investment, more jobs' - the benefits of tax reform being lauded by the state Labor Party Treasurer in Victoria. The only political party that I am aware of that stood against tax reform was the federal Labor Party. And today we find out that all along it has had another secret tax plan as to how it is to pay for its roll-back and its new spending. We say, and the people of Australia say, `Come clean.' Tell the people of Australia what your new taxes are; tell them by how much you are going to put them up so that at the next election they can cast an informed vote between the increases in tax from the Labor Party and the good economic management from the coalition.</DOC>

 - I will check that allegation, because I happened to hear -  - I have been informed by the Treasurer that there is no measure in the budget paper that did that. It is very interesting that you should ask me the question, because there was no measure in the budget that did that. I happened to hear an interview, when I was out walking this morning, with the new head of CSIRO. He was being fairly vigorously questioned by somebody from the ABC -  - I think his name is Garrett. - What a soaringly intellectual contribution to the deliberations of parliament that one was, Mr Speaker. The CSIRO head was constantly having put to him some allegations that had been made by the staff association, which seemed to have been replicated by the question asked by them. He made the entirely compelling point that this government has in fact allocated massive additional resources to science. When I looked through the budget, whenever I came across the words `science' or `innovation' I found a figure of $3 billion near them. That is the size of the commitment I made in the Backing Australia's Ability statement that was released on 29 January this year.The reality is that this government has given a higher priority to science and innovation than has any government in the last 30 years. This government has invested massively in the intellectual future of this country; this government has given new hope to Australia's scientific community. It was this government that acted on the recommendations of the Wills committee, which recommended a doubling - and we did it in the 1999 budget - of the investment from the government of this nation in medical research over the next five years. Ours is a very proud record. Ours is a record of giving massive and important priority to science and innovation and all matters related to them - and rightly so, because they are very much tied up with the long-term future of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. The budget has received a good response from regional Australia, because they understand that it is about time the federal government gave support to nurses in the country. This will make a big difference to country practitioners. People also understand it is about time country Australians got better access to after-hours service, something that they have never had previously. The other, broader, policies which will affect the whole of Australia will also help country Australia. With cancer of the cervix it is actually country women who are one of the high risk groups because they are not being properly screened. Our program on cervical cancer will particularly help country women, as it will women from non-English-speaking backgrounds and indigenous women. Similarly, our programs on diabetes, asthma and mental health are a great innovation to Medicare.I am aware of some alternative comments. In fact, this morning on the Today show, when asked when the Labor Party would be outlining policies, the Leader of the Opposition said, `Watch this space.' I must say I will be watching tonight, because it is 678 days since the shadow minister gave a speech at the Nursing Federation conference in July 1999, and at that conference she promised within nine months to have detailed policies - that is, April 2000. It is now 22 months since that speech, and we have seen nothing on developing a publicly funded coordinated care program; we have seen nothing on overcoming the major inequalities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health; we have seen nothing on tackling the special needs of people with mental health problems; we have seen nothing on focus for health promotion; we have seen nothing on early intervention for the long-term financial burden of ill health; we have seen nothing on the control of the rising costs of medicine by ensuring technology is used effectively, and we have seen nothing on greater access to information technology for consumers - seven areas that the shadow minister outlined 22 months ago that the opposition would have policies on by April 2000. Well, tonight is the night. Tonight is the night also for something else. It is 262 days today since Cathy Freeman won the gold medal in the 400 metres, and on that great day something else happened for Australian consumers: the Labor Party made their biggest ever commitment in the last two years, and that was to retain the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance. We have been waiting 262 days to see the detail of this commitment. It still has not come out. Well, tonight is the night when the Leader of the Opposition can, once and for all, rule out that he is going to exclude ancillaries from the 30 per cent rebate. Tonight is the night when he can finally rule out that high front end deductible policies will not be ineligible for the 30 per cent rebate. Tonight is the night when he can say, `We are not going to make ineligible those policies with exclusions, we are not going to take away the 30 per cent rebate for new members accessing health insurance, we are not going to pay the 30 per cent on base rate premiums only and we are not going to put a GST on health insurance to pay for our roll-back.' Every one of these undertakings could be done within the very limited information that the Leader of the Opposition has given on this. If he does not rule these out tonight, we will know that he has a secret tax plan to slug consumers, just as Labor did in 1984.</DOC>

 - No, I cannot. But I will tell you what I can do: I can tell you that industry loves the announcement that Senator Minchin made the other night. I can tell you that industry thinks it is a great announcement. I will tell you what the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, Bob Herbert - and you were addressing him the other night; you came straight after I had been to him talking to them - said: ... the government deserved 'brownie points' for listening to industry's concerns.'This is not a budget backdown; it's just the application of common sense' ... 'We've been talking to them since January about the need to make the system simpler, and they've listened.'I simply say amen to Bob Herbert. I think he has got it right. While I am on my feet, can I just remind the House that this government devoted record sums to science and innovation spending in Australia, and obviously, if our commitment to science and innovation is, in the eyes of the opposition, inadequate, we will hear tonight. As to all of the additional funding we are going to have from the opposition, maybe we will hear tonight that, instead of the 175 per cent premium R&amp;D rate that the government has offered, the Leader of the Opposition thinks it should be 200 per cent or 225. If he does, he may be able to tell us how he is going to pay for that. Or is the reality that when it comes to the policies of the opposition, not only in industry but in so many other areas, the opposition's great dream all along has been, knowing that this nation needed a new taxation system, that this government would have the political courage to introduce the new taxation system and it would inherit the benefit? - Well, the Leader of the Opposition says that that is rubbish. If he really believes it is rubbish, he has the opportunity tonight to tell the Australian people how he intends to roll back the GST. There are only two credible positions on taxation reform in this country: either you believe, in the name of Australia's secure economic future, in a reformed taxation system or, if you believe, as the opposition has told us for almost three years, that the changes were unnecessary and bad and inimical to Australia's long-term interests, you should have the courage to repudiate that tax system, you should have the courage to roll it back and you should have the candour to tell the Australian people how you intend to roll it back -  - and what new taxes are going to be implemented in order to fund the roll-back. So all Australia will be watching the Leader of the Opposition tonight. I will tune in myself. I will come along with the Treasurer, and we will listen. We will have our pencil and our pad, and every time he announces a roll-back we will look and we will listen for the expenditure cut or the tax increase that is going to fund it. We will listen to not only the details of the roll-back; we will also want to know how he is going to pay for it, whether he is going to increase income tax or, alternatively, whether the reality is really that, when it comes to the crunch, the Leader of the Opposition will run away from roll-back. Is the reality that he will run away from roll-back? Well, he has got a great opportunity tonight. We will all be tuned in. We are all anxious. We will be there. The Australian people will be listening, and we will - at long last, after 5¼ years - find out whether the Leader of the Opposition stands for anything, or whether he is just a completely hypocritical political trickster.</DOC>

 - I do want to particularly thank the member for Hughes for her question. She is a great supporter of defence, and she is a great supporter of Defence families in her electorate, and I know that is appreciated. I know also that the defence community is very pleased to see the government bring down the best budget for Defence in decades, because this is a budget which provides the largest injection of funds that we have seen - in fact, $23½ billion over the next decade in today's money, $27 billion if indexed. It provides Defence with the resources to get on with all the things that need to be done to give Australia an efficient, up-to-date, modern Defence Force. We have money for people issues and for 38 major projects, which are spelt out and specifically endorsed and given approval for in the budget. That is important in itself, because over the next four years there is $5½ billion of spending, much of which can be available for defence industry in Australia, and that means jobs here at home. On top of that, on the personnel side we have more money for reserves and for cadets. This government has honoured the promises it made in the white paper last year. It is very good news for the country that in the future we are going to have a Defence Force that is properly resourced. I do want to pay tribute particularly to the Prime Minister for his leadership in this area, and I want to say to the Treasurer that it is great to have a Treasurer who can organise the economy so well that we can do the things that need to be done. I am asked what alternative policies there are. I looked up the synonym for vision and the word is hallucination. They have subs in their dreams on the other side. But there is also, under their defence policy, a commitment from the Labor Party to establish what they would call `Coast Guard'. In fact, behind this policy is a proposal to take the Navy out of the surveillance work - 1,800 patrol boat days - that it today undertakes around the Australian coast. The Labor Party intends replacing that with non-ADF assets. I believe the best people to do that job are the people of the Australian Navy. It is a great mistake to take the Navy out of that particular exercise, and it is not just me who says that it is a mistake. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was a minister, brought down a report which said that the policy he today adopts was a policy that should not be adopted. In fact, if you go back to the report, he costed the alternative he now supports. When he was in government he was opposed to that alternative and now he supports an alternative which, if you costed it in today's dollars, would cost $2 billion and take the Navy out of performing a vital function in this country's interests. Not only would we no longer have the Navy doing the job - and they are the best people to do that particular job, so you would get a less effective job done - but also it would cost us an additional $2 billion to set up this alternative arrangement. We are perfectly entitled to ask, `How are you going to pay for this additional $2 billion?' The reason I ask the question today is that back in March this year - only 9 March, nine or 10 weeks ago - the shadow Treasurer said, `You can have our policies after the budget has been brought down.' Well, the budget has been brought down - the best budget we have seen for years for defence - and we are entitled to say, `When you give your big policy speech tonight, it is about time we had a bit of detail, as your shadow Treasurer promised, on defence.'The Leader of the Opposition ought to know something about defence - he was the Minister for Defence for years. He has been the Leader of the Opposition for 5½ years and he still cannot tell you, as at this very moment, what his policy is. It is about time that the Labor Party moved away from the vagueness of what they have been saying, and it is incumbent on him to say -  - If there is going to be another couple of billion dollars, I think a lot of Australians will want to know whether Stephen Conroy was right. What he is basically saying is, `Oh well, if you want to have this lesser effort to guard Australia's sea lanes and the like - entrances to Australia - then it is going to cost you a couple of billion dollars.' What is his plan? Are we going to increase some taxes in this area? Well, tonight is the night we certainly want to hear.</DOC>

 - As the shadow minister should know, this is not a government which throws money at problems. This is a government which believes in making judicious, targeted investment in solving issues, in building community infrastructure and in building up the human capital of our nation. There is a perfectly good reason why the programs and the extensions to the existing programs announced in the budget are taking place in some cases from early next year and in some cases from the middle of next year. It is because we believe in consulting with Job Network members, we believe in consulting with community work coordinators -  - we believe in negotiating contract variations with them and we believe in giving them appropriate time to put new infrastructure in place.The shadow minister for employment suggests to me that this government is dilatory and that this government does not move sufficiently quickly. Let me just refer to something the Leader of the Opposition, old manana man -  - said on Tuesday of this week when he was asked what he was going to do immediately to help people in Australia. He said: `Ours is not a vision for the first year or two. Ours is a vision for a decade. If it means that we have to start it off slow, we start it off slow.' The sheer hypocrisy and the sheer inconsistency of it! I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to say exactly what he is going to do for job seekers and to say it tonight.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I think the whole House knows that he has a great interest in the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio, and Australia's standing in the international community. In the budget, the government announced a substantial number of important initiatives in the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio: a small expansion, admittedly, but an expansion of our diplomatic network with the opening of a post in Chicago, which is, after all, one of the great business and financial centres of the world; a very substantial and very important upgrading of our secure communications network; and the extension of the highly successful Export Market Development Scheme. In the area of aid, the government announced a six per cent increase in the Australian aid budget, which in dollar terms is an increase in our aid budget of $125 million. That does constitute a serious and substantial increase in Australia's aid budget to well over $1.7 billion. The honourable member asked if there were any alternative approaches. I note that on 23 May the member for Kingsford-Smith and his colleague Senator Cook put out a press release which, not surprisingly, was an opportunistic and expedient press release attacking the government's initiatives in the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. I will explain why that is the case. First of all, the assertions made in the press release are, not surprisingly, untrue. For example, the press release said that no new money is made available to promote Australia in the world. Actually, the department's budget has been increased by 10 per cent and the aid budget by six per cent, which is $125 million. So to say that no new money is to be made available is clearly a complete nonsense.The second thing about the press release which is especially interesting, but I suppose will be addressed tonight by the Leader of the Opposition, is that this press release attacks the lack of funding by the government in two particular areas. First, it attacks what it describes as the `miserly performance which undermines Australia's national interest in terms of our aid budget'. We have increased the aid budget by $125 million, and the opposition is going out and telling the aid community and the Australian community - Australians who are interested in these issues, and a lot are - that in increasing the aid budget by the amount we have, the government is being miserly.What is the leitmotiv of that: that Labor would increase the aid budget by much more. That is the message you are transmitting - your policy says so. The member for Kingsford-Smith went to the Labor Party conference and got them to endorse a commitment to increase the aid budget to 0.32 per cent of our GNP. Put in dollars and cents terms, that is an increase in the aid budget, over and above what it is for the next financial year, of $438 million. Labor are running around telling the aid community that they are going to increase the aid budget by $438 million. This press release also says that the government irresponsibly slashed the Export Market Development Grants scheme and that we have not restored that funding, and complains that the funding is capped. So the Labor Party is implying that they will increase funding for the EMDG. They are telegraphing that message to the community. They are talking of hundreds of millions of dollars in increased expenditure.We have the shadow Treasurer claiming that the budget surplus would be larger under Labor. Shadow ministers are running around claiming that there will be increases of spending in their own portfolios, while complaining about the lack of spending by the government, that the government is miserly and does not provide enough financial support for everything under the sun, apparently, including the aid budget, where apparently we are spending $438 million too little. Labor is saying all of those sorts of things, and we wonder how they would ever finance these increases in spending. It was only today that we finally found out from the shadow minister for finance, Senator Conroy. - Financial services - whatever. We all wait for tonight when all this will somehow be drawn together. Mr Speaker, you know how the member for Kingsford-Smith is often referred to as `Danger man'. Since he is about to snatch $438 million from the budget surplus to finance an increase in aid, we would expect tomorrow's headlines to be `Danger man robs roll-back', or words to that effect. What we want to see, with all these press releases that go out and all these complaints made about lack of spending in different portfolio areas, is whether you are fair dinkum, whether you would do anything differently, whether you would do anything about it; and, if you would, how you would finance it. What taxes would you increase or what programs would you cut? Labor's strategy is a hoax on the Australian people and it will not wash.</DOC>

 -  I thank the member for Forrest for his question. I can inform the House that Work for the Dole is one of the signature programs and significant successes of the Howard government. Work for the Dole participants have a 76 per cent better chance of being off benefit and into work three months after leaving the program than do other job seekers. Thanks to the budget changes, all job seekers under 40 who have been on benefit for six months and are not already in a support program will be required to do more than simply look for work. If they do not choose another form of activity, they will be required to work for the dole. Theses changes are based on this government's fundamental understanding that the best preparation for work is work itself. They are based on our fundamental understanding that anything which encourages passivity and defeatism among job seekers is cruelty masquerading as compassion.We may never be able to abolish unemployment entirely, but we can abolish having nothing to do as a semipermanent way of life for hundreds of thousands of Australians. Thanks to this budget, there will be nearly 250,000 Work for the Dole and funded community work places over the next four years. Everyone knows where this government stands on Work for the Dole, but these days no-one knows where Labor stands on anything. The opposition's first response to Work for the Dole was to describe it as almost evil. If that is no longer the case, the Leader of the Opposition should specify exactly what Labor's position is tonight. The Australian people are no longer interested in hearing the Leader of the Opposition's opinion; they want to know what his policies are. They want the prince of prolix to stop waffling and start working. That means that when he stands up tonight he has to give clear, costed current commitments about what he will do on these employment service policies.I wonder what excuse the Leader of the Opposition is going to come up with tonight for failing to come clean on his policies. Will it be, `The dog ate my homework'; will it be, `I left the credit card in the pocket of my other pants'; will it be `I've got a headache'? If the Leader of the Opposition cannot come clean tonight and say exactly where he stands and what he will do, he will go down in history as the worst opposition leader since Arthur Calwell.</DOC>

 - No. The substantial legislative changes which the government has announced for the reform of the insurance industry in Australia are going to cause the insurance industry overall to have to raise significant amounts of capital to meet the future legislative requirements. In addition, the industry itself is helping significantly in setting up the new non-profit company, which is going to be owned and run by the industry, and it is providing enormous logistical support to help to get funds out to those people who are enduring hardship.When there were banking collapses in the early nineties, the Keating government took 12 months to bring in the Commonwealth Bank to help rescue people involved in the State Bank of Victoria collapse. In this case, it is the collapse of a private sector organisation - an insurance company - on a scale never seen before in Australia, and the government has no government insurance company that is available to simply take over the processing of claims. At all times, our sole focus is to help people in hardship - that is what we have focused on. - We totally refute any suggestion that any political contributions or activity have in any way affected the proper enforcement powers of APRA or any of the activities of the government in relation to this matter. I would like to make one further point, which is an important point in view of some comments about superannuation. Last year, I introduced a bill into the parliament to give APRA greater powers to protect superannuation. When I put those powers to the Senate, Labor watered down the measures of the bill. The penalty for noncompliance was cut in half by the Labor Party and the Democrats, from $11,000 to $5,500. So, now, if superannuation trustees fail to lodge returns with APRA or the Australian Taxation Office, if they fail to provide other information requested by APRA or the Australian Taxation Office or if they fail to provide statistical information to APRA, they face half the penalty that we on this side of the House wanted. - So, whilst we are trying to be tough on the financial services industry, the Labor Party, as best shown by the example of this bill, went soft when they were asked to be tougher with people not complying with the law.</DOC>

 - I do remember that budget reply; it laid the groundwork for the defeat of the Keating government. - That is why I remember it very, very well. -  - I certainly do remember that speech. It was a very good speech. It made a number of things very plain to the Australian public. - It made it very plain to the Australian public that we were in favour of reforming Australia's industrial relations system. And did that truly predict what we were going to do? It made it very plain to the Australian public that we were going to run a responsible fiscal policy. - It made it very plain to the Australian public that we were going to create economic conditions that would help Australian families.  - In other words, I took the opportunity of making it very plain to the Australian public what the then Liberal and National parties opposition stood for. I remember those days very, very clearly because we were facing a government at that time that had adopted a vastly different approach to taxation from the one this government has adopted. We were facing then a government which had fought and opposed the introduction of a broad based indirect tax by the opposition in 1993 and had won the election off the back of deceiving the Australian people regarding their own taxation intentions. Then, of course, we were facing at that time a finance minister in the then government who claimed to be excused for misleading the people in 1993 not on the basis of anything the then government had said but because the opposition apparently had not been smart enough to put enough pressure on the government. In other words, you can get away with something, according to the now Leader of the Opposition, if your opponent does not put enough pressure on you to come clean with the Australian public. That is the measure of the political morality of the person who would be the Prime Minister of Australia. That is the true measure of the political morality of the member for Brand: `Don't judge me according to my own honour; judge me as to whether my political opponent can catch me out.' That is the measure. Well, all I can say is that tonight is the night. Tonight is the night for the Leader of the Opposition at long last, after 5¼ years of being Leader of the Opposition: will he summon the courage to tell the Australian people what he stands for? Will he spell out the details of roll-back? Will he do what Stephen Conroy has said Labor will do, and that is increase taxes? Will he tell us what the taxes are? Will he identify all of the programs, or will he once again retreat into a sea of waffle and imprecision? The Australian nation waits with great interest. Tonight is the night for the Leader of the Opposition to finally demonstrate whether he really believes in or stands for anything. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. </DOC>

 - You were going to do something about it in the 14th year. The reality is that you had 13 years to do something about this. The simple reality is that the people who should be funding the entitlements of the One.Tel employees, if there is a receivership or a liquidation and there are not assets in the company to do it, are Messrs Rich and Keeling, through a refund of the bonuses. They are the people who should be making the payment. If that does not happen, our position is this: our scheme will be triggered, and if the New South Wales government will match its rhetoric with a bit of action those One.Tel employees can be paid their entitlements. I would hazard to suggest that, in the absence of precise details of the employment arrangements of each of the employees - because they are not available - given that the company has only been in operation for a period of two or three years, most of these employees would not have been working for the company for a long time.  The Leader of the Opposition mentioned National Textiles. In the case of National Textiles, the New South Wales government chipped in the same as the Commonwealth. If the New South Wales government were prepared to do that, I would be able to confidently assert in the parliament right now that the great bulk of all of the entitlements of those One.Tel workers would in fact be met. I would remind the opposition that, since early last year, the federal government has paid just over $2 million to New South Wales employees who have lost entitlements. Nearly 1,000 New South Wales workers would have received more under the scheme if the Carr government had met its share. The Australian public is entitled to look to the performance of Labor governments. The most senior Labor figure in Australia is the Premier of New South Wales. That Premier stands condemned right now for not being willing to match what the Commonwealth has been willing to put in. The Premier of New South Wales is apparently going to address the One.Tel workers. Instead of making fine speeches to the One.Tel workers, he ought to promise them a cheque. Instead of rhetoric and words, what about a little underwriting of their entitlements? We do not believe that the scheme put forward by the opposition is equitable. We remember that for 13 years you did nothing. There are thousands upon thousands of Australian employees who lost their entitlements while you were a senior minister in the Hawke and Keating governments. Year after year, people lost their entitlements, and for 13 years you sat on your tail and did absolutely nothing. You now come along with a plan that would slug honest, decent, caring employers. In the end, if these entitlements ought to be picked up, it is a community responsibility. It is not the responsibility disproportionately of small business; it is a community responsibility. The New South Wales government is rolling in money as a result of the GST. The Victorian government is rolling in money as a result of the GST. The Queensland government is absolutely filled to overflowing with money as a result of the GST. The least they can do is dip into their pockets, show a bit of decency to Australian workers and match the Commonwealth's generous scheme.The other thing I might do while I am on my feet and the Leader of the Opposition gives me an opportunity to do so is to inform the House, as I have already the Australian public, that the Commonwealth intends to amend the law so that in future, where bonuses are paid in the circumstances where those bonuses were paid to the bosses of One.Tel, that money will be refundable and can be used to meet the lawful and legitimate entitlements of the workers and also the other creditors of the company. Once again, this is an example of the determination of this government, whilst being a great supporter of the capitalist system, to prevent a recurrence of this type of thing in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question and, indeed, for the fact that he does take these problems, which are very severe and tragic problems in the Middle East, seriously. All Australians, I am sure, were shocked and horrified at the bombing on Friday in Tel Aviv that killed 20 people and injured more than 100. In direct answer to the honourable member's question, that did represent a very serious escalation of the cycle of violence that we have already been seeing for quite some time now in the Middle East. If left unchecked, there is a real danger that this violence could spiral totally out of control, with a devastating effect on hopes for an early peace in the Middle East. With that danger firmly in mind, the Australian government condemns the terrorist attack, in the strongest of terms. Moreover, we urge both sides to step back from the brink in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy and to accept that, for the sake of both peoples, there must be an immediate cease-fire and a return to the negotiating table.I note that following a statement of condemnation of the attack issued by the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr Yasser Arafat, on 2 June - and we welcome his statement - the Israeli government has held off retaliation and that, over the last two days, the level of violence in the Palestinian territories has at least diminished somewhat; and that is a welcome development.At a meeting in Pretoria on 2 May, I emphasised to Mr Arafat the futility of the cycle of violence that has gone on since September last year. This latest example underlines the point and demonstrates how critically important it is for a genuine cease-fire to be solidified. Only then can the negotiators again sit down and work out peaceful solutions to the problems between both sides. It is the Australian government's view that they should use the recommendations of the Mitchell committee report as a very sound basis for their work. As I said at the beginning of my answer to the honourable member's question, this is a shocking development in the Middle East, and we can only hope and, indeed, pray that out of this tragedy comes some good and that a cease-fire and negotiations will commence.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition can work himself up into a frenzy and shout about the big end of town as frequently as he likes, but that will not alter the fact that, for 13 years, he was pretty close to the big end of town. In that 13 years, I did not notice a big gap between the big end of town and the Hawke, Keating and Beazley governments. In fact, they were very close: there was a lot of leakage between the governments of Hawke and Keating, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a very senior member.What the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is to introduce a new tax. That is what he wants to do. This addition to the superannuation guarantee charge is just another tax. When the Labor Party want to do something, they always resort to a new tax. It is true, of course, that none of the state governments have agreed to make a contribution. That is absolutely true. State governments are always willing to let the Commonwealth government make the running, pick up the tab and do their heavy lifting - whatever the case may be. That has always been the case and it always will be the case. Of course, if you can shift the responsibility for these things onto the decent section of the corporate sector, which still comprises the great bulk of men and women in business in the Australian community, all the better.I go back to basics. For 13 years, Labor did nothing. For 13 years, men and women lost their jobs, lost their entitlements and did not get a farthing from the Hawke or Keating governments. It has taken my government to bring in a scheme that provides a safety net. That scheme should be matched by those state governments that are rolling with money - absolutely rolling with money.After all the concern that Mr Carr has expressed about the One.Tel workers, the passionate pleas he has made on radio to Mr Rich and Mr Keeling to disgorge the bonuses, and the eloquent addresses he had made to the workers at the rally, I am sure he will dig into the ample coffers of the state of New South Wales and match the money that has been put on the table by the Commonwealth. I would think the One.Tel employees who live in New South Wales would say, `The Commonwealth is doing its bit. What about you, Mr Carr?' And I think the One.Tel employees are entitled say to Mr Carr, `Bob, your words are fine, but what about an assurance of support?' - The Leader of the Opposition: yak, yak, yak, interjecting the whole time. You had 13 years and you did nothing. For 13 years you allowed people to lose their entitlements with no reimbursement. It has taken the coalition government to bring in a safety net scheme. The least the Labor governments of Australia and, indeed, the Liberal government of South Australia can do in the name of fairness and decency is to match the Commonwealth scheme. If that happens in relation to One.Tel, there is no reason why the employees of that company should not get the overwhelming bulk, if not every last dollar, of their entitlements.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I can inform the House that the March quarter balance of payments were released today and they show that the current account deficit for March was $4.7 billion, or 2.8 per cent of GDP. Excluding the June quarter of 1997, which included the gold sales of the Reserve Bank of Australia, this is the lowest current account deficit as a share of GDP since the March quarter of 1981. It is the best quarterly outcome since March 1981. As we know, the current account deficit blew out, starting in 1983, under 13 years of Labor government.The fall in the current account deficit reflected a $1.1 billion turnaround in the balance on goods and services to a surplus of $212 million for the quarter. That is, Australia's trade with the rest of the world in the March quarter was in surplus. The whole of the current account deficit consists of the net income deficit, which is payment on past accrued foreign debt, in particular the build-up of foreign debt under 13 years of Labor government from 1983 to 1996. The March quarter showed a 0.5 per cent rise in export volumes driven by goods exports and a 3.3 per cent decrease in import volumes. Two of the factors which have contributed to the growth in Australia's exports to a quarterly surplus in our trade and to our lowest current account deficit since 1981 are, first, that we took tax off exports. There is now, under the new tax system, no tax on Australian exports. That is a $3½ billion tax break to Australian exporters, and it took a new tax system to do it. The only member of the opposition that I have ever seen acknowledge that was the now shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs - and he nods. He is the only member of the Labor Party that has ever acknowledged the benefits to exporters from the new tax system. The Labor Party did not have the wit to put in place a tax system which would help Australia's exporters.  In addition to the help to exporters that has come from the new tax system, the exchange rate, which is supercompetitive, has no doubt been of advantage to Australian exporters. At a time when the world economy is slowing, that is of enormous and direct advantage to Australian exporters. For example, the volume of elaborately transformed manufactured exports increased 2½ per cent in the quarter, with elaborately transformed manufactured exports up through the year by 9.3 per cent. The sharp decline in the current account is expected to be maintained through the year at around three per cent. These are some of the lowest rates in proportion to GDP since the 1990s. The outcome for the March quarter is consistent with the budget outlook. I congratulate those Australian exporters who, helped by exchange rate and tax factors, are now exporting Australia into a trade surplus and the lowest current account since 1981 - a good result for Australia.</DOC>

 - Let me point out to the shadow minister that the Howard government's Employee Entitlements Support Scheme is probably the most significant and substantial addition to Australia's social safety net in many years. This government is the first government in 100 years to actually put in place real protection for workers' entitlements. In 13 years, members opposite did nothing. In none of the five Labor states is there any protection for workers' entitlements. When Premier Beattie last week said that there was protection under state awards, he was fibbing - there is none whatsoever. And when Premier Carr waxes rhetorical about workers' entitlements he is not backing up his fine words with cold, hard cash. This government is absolutely determined to protect One.Tel workers and we are absolutely determined to pursue One.Tel bosses. - Let me conclude my answer by saying that the scheme is fully funded and provisioned in the budget. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can inform the House that one of the reasons why this government reformed the Australian taxation system is not just to help Australian exporters and to cut income taxes for families but also to ensure that there is a decent tax base which is funding the services rendered by the states, because every last dollar of goods and services tax is paid to state governments to deliver goods and services for the people in their various states. Today goods and services tax funds the salary of every single schoolteacher in every single classroom in every state education system in this country. After it has funded that, it actually funds police salaries so we have law and order and other necessary state services. One of the reasons why this government put in place a new tax system was to ensure there was a decent base to keep those social services going.Needless to say, if there were a political party elected in the future that wanted to roll back that base but keep the same services, it would have to put up some other kind of tax. It is an obvious point, and when we left the House two Thursdays ago the 14-year-old schoolboy from Kambah High School had made that point. He had asked the Labor Party how they could keep services and roll back the GST, and we had the immortal words of Senator Stephen Conroy. He said:I don't think we can run away from the fact that there will be hard decisions, and we have to prioritise how we are going to fund our spending initiatives. And we're going to have to make choices between: `Are we going to cut programs? Are we going to increase taxes in this area?'Ever since Senator Conroy issued those words, the Labor Party has been trying to run away from the hard decisions. That is what he said: `I don't think we can run away from the hard decisions'. If you want to be an alternative government, you cannot run away from the hard decisions. Are you going to cut programs or increase taxes?The Leader of the Opposition, when he has no answers, turns around and engages in conversation. We used to use this as a tactic when we were in opposition: turn around and pretend you are not interested when you are being asked a question. Which is it going to be? Is it going to be cutting services or increasing taxes? Government member - Or both. - Or both? Turning his back, he is engaged in deep conversation at the moment with the shadow minister for education. We might have expected that he would answer the question when he gave his post budget interview to Laurie Oakes on the Nine Network.  - It was an absolute classic. Laurie Oakes asked him this question:Why, when I say will you guarantee no increase the Medicare levy, why can't you say, of course I will?BEAZLEY: Because I've already picked that up on what I've had to say.OAKES: Okay, well I'll take that as a guarantee of no increase in the Medicare levy. What about company tax?BEAZLEY: Laurie, Laurie - they always begin their answers with `Laurie, Laurie' -  - Daryl, Daryl, taught them that - BEAZLEY: Laurie, Laurie, the point I'm making here is that it's silly for an Opposition leader, or anyone else, to sit down in front of somebody like yourself, and it's also undignified, and I won't be involved in that.Here is the question:What about company tax?BEAZLEY: Laurie, Laurie, the point I'm making here is that it's silly for an Opposition leader, or anyone else, to sit down in front of somebody like yourself, and it's also undignified, and I won't be involved in that. `Undignified' for an alternative Prime Minister to go through tax by tax under scrutiny like that. Undignified! He is asked the question, `Will you guarantee no increases in company tax?' and he says that it is undignified to give the answer. We know why it is undignified to give the answer, because you do intend to put up company tax. He is asked about indexation on petrol and it is undignified to give an answer. We know why it is undignified to give an answer: because you want the option to raise petrol taxes.We remember what you did in the 1993 election. In the 1993 election you gave almost precisely the same commitment. It was the Paul Keating commitment: `What I am promising is not to put up tax.' That was the promise. The way it worked out was an increase in every wholesale sales tax, an increase in petrol excise, the abolition of income tax cuts and an increase in the company tax. The Leader of the Opposition was playing this game back in September 1993, and I ask everybody in the House to go back and read the speech. He justified putting taxes up after the 1993 election because he was not pinned beforehand. These are the words that he used.... The fact that the opposition does not rub the electorate's nose in what we say are our election promises does not mean that we are breaking our election promises. The opposition was incapable of getting through the flack of its GST and presenting in the public mind the fact that if a government says it will maintain the current level of taxation as a percentage of GDP, yet its forward estimates on revenue suggest that the revenue will fall, then logically that government will raise revenue somewhere down the line.The current forward estimates show revenue will decline over the forward estimates. So if he is making the same promise -  - then his words -  - condemn him. Now the conversation with the shadow minister for education has concluded. - We have finally got his attention, Mr Speaker, because they show over the forward estimates that revenue will fall. Here is what he said:... logically that government will raise revenue somewhere down the line.`Somewhere down the line' - condemned out of your own mouth. When you were asked about company taxes and indexation on petrol and income taxes and in relation to indirect taxes, it is no answer to say it is `undignified' to answer the question. It is undignified not to answer the question. Come clean with the Australian people and be honest with them. - </DOC>

 - The debt to GDP ratio today is 48.3 per cent. As I said in my earlier answer, in the March quarter we were actually trading in goods and services at a surplus. The whole of the current account deficit is in servicing foreign debt. - In 1996 the debt to GDP ratio was 38 per cent -  - So it has gone up from 38 per cent to 48 per cent. In 1983, when the Labor Party was elected to government, the debt to GDP ratio - remember it finished at 38 per cent of GDP - was 14 per cent. It went from 14 per cent to 38 per cent - it tripled. - I love these questions, because in nominal terms it increased 667 per cent under Labor - 667 per cent. - I make two points. One is the premise of the question was again wrong, because he was asked whether it was half the nation's income. In fact, the servicing of foreign debt as a proportion of the nation's income - that is, its export earnings - is today 9.4 per cent and it peaked at 20 per cent in September 1990. It took 20 per cent of the nation's earnings to service our foreign debt. The last point I would make in relation to foreign debt is this: since this government was elected, in net terms it has not -  - Since this government was elected, in net terms it has not borrowed a dollar. - It has not borrowed a dollar. In other words, the Commonwealth, far from increasing foreign debt, has been retiring foreign debt for the last five years. - Can you imagine if this government had followed the example of its predecessors and borrowed over the last five years $80 billion. The foreign debt would be $80 billion higher today than it is. In fact, not only would it be $80 billion higher; it would be higher again by the net amount that we have reduced debt by. So the government has not only not borrowed but retired foreign debt. It has attuned the financial profligacy of the Australian Labor Party: we are now trading in a surplus. I am not saying that all of our economic problems are solved. Plainly, they are not. It will take a lot to service that build-up of foreign debt over the last -  - I take that interjection. The one thing that would not solve any of Australia's economic problems would be a trade union dominated Labor government. The evidence is on the board: they took debt from 14 per cent to 38 per cent over 13 years. They ran up $80 billion of Commonwealth debt and added to it. They fought every step of the way to put the budget back into balance. They are threatening to engage in unfunded promises with new tax rises. The one thing you can say about the Labor Party is they never understood and they have not learnt a thing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I have travelled to the electorate of Gilmore and spoken to small businesses there, and they are certainly very complimentary in their praise of the member for Gilmore. Small business in Gilmore should, as should small business everywhere, be congratulated for bedding down this new tax. What I am hearing in Gilmore and in other electorates is that the GST and the BAS are starting to become less and less of an issue.  That is not good news for the Labor Party, because they are trying to beat up a little storm on this. What I hear from small business is that they want certainty. They want to know where they are going to be in 12 months time. What I hear from small business is that they are concerned about roll-back and about the conflicting statements they hear on roll-back. I would be concerned as well if I were in small business. First of all, we had the shadow minister for small business, the member for Hunter, talking on roll-back earlier this year, on 23 March. When asked, `What will roll-back specifically mean for small business?' he responded:Well, roll-back can come with a cost and without a cost.  Not all roll-back is necessarily expensive but we think still some changes can be made ...When he was pulled into order on this, he then was asked by Chris Lewis, who is a very agreeable bloke, on the Valley Life program on 2 April: Roll-back can come at a cost or without a cost - is this true? The member for Hunter said:Roll-back for small business can come at a cost or without a cost for government. I was making a point that we've a few ideas up our sleeve, some of which will come at a cost to government.The member for Hunter even repeated that claim in this House:... roll-back may come at a cost to government, which, of course, is obvious ...It is obvious: roll-back will come at a cost to government. Then last week he tried to excuse himself from these comments by saying - this time in Rockhampton; he certainly gets around on radio - this:The government likes to imply that roll-back means a further cost to government; that is not the case.But he said it in this House. The only element of truth in what the member for Hunter keeps saying is that roll-back will come at a cost to small business and it will come at a cost to taxpayers. It is time the member for Hunter, in his fits of candour, convinced his leadership to abandon a policy that is bad for government, bad for taxpayers and bad for Australia.</DOC>

 - No. I think it was a coalition government that introduced part IVA -  - I was not here at the time, but as I recall - and the Prime Minister is nodding - it was a coalition that introduced part IVA. As I recall it, the Labor Party never introduced anything. I take the silence from the opposition as a confirmation.This government has probably been much tougher than any of its predecessor governments in clamping down on obvious tax avoidances - particularly the R&amp;D syndicates, which were probably the largest way of avoiding paying tax. They were closely followed by infrastructure borrowings. Not only did we get no help from the Labor Party in closing them down but the Labor Party had actually opened them up.  - The infrastructure borrowings, as I recall, were marketed by merchant banks -  - and you could not even get into the infrastructure borrowing scheme until you had $500,000 to invest. - And all of the tables worked off a $500,000 amount. The Labor Party introduced it; we closed it down. We did it on R&amp;D syndicates. We have an enviable record.  - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that she has a real interest in this matter and has been particularly delighted with the recently announced $1½ million funding for a new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander medical centre in Mackay. Nothing is more important than access to health services for all Australians. Wherever you work, wherever you live, wherever you seek to be productive in this country, you need to know that you can have fair and reasonable access to medical services. Of course, we have had a real problem in Australia. After many, many years of neglect and poor planning, we reached a chronic shortage of GPs and specialists in regional Australia, essentially because we had not been training enough rural and regional students to practise medical services in rural areas. Medical students from the country are about nine times more likely to practise in the country than are urban students. We now have the situation where we are 500 GPs and 700 to 800 specialists short in regional Australia. Indeed, an illustration of this is my own home town, Gunnedah, with a population in the town and district of 13,000 or 14,000 and a waiting list of two to three months to see a GP for a non-urgent matter. Australians would not normally accept that. It is not as if it is new: that has been the situation for two or three years.In response in large part to an excellent package put forward by the Minister for Health and Aged Care after he had visited many rural areas with me, we put together the More Doctors, Better Services package last year - a $562 million commitment, a real commitment, involving such things as the John Flynn scholarships, the Rural Retention Program for GPs, the rural women's GP service and the medical rural bonded scholarships. But this year we have added a very important element which takes it to virtually $700 million as a package, and that is nurses for rural and regional areas. In this year's budget there is around $104 million going towards enabling general practices in rural Australia to employ additional practice nurses and another $13 million for 100 new rural nursing scholarships worth around $10 million. That will see us supporting students of nursing in much the same way as we now do doctors. We will also be investing around $43 million in programs using nurses to reduce the workload on rural GPs, which will of course assist us in not only recruiting but retaining more rural GPs.We have heard nothing from the ALP in this area - about the most appalling policy failure on their part when they were in government. We have heard nothing from them at all. The best we can hope for - given that we heard nothing from the member for Dickson on regional policies when she was responsible for that area and, when the member for Batman appeared, he found there was nothing ready; and we have seen nothing from him either - is that they will go and have a yarn to their expert on rural and regional policy, Bill Kelty. Remember Bill? He was the bloke who travelled around the bush and recommended what they ought to do for rural and regional policy. After 13 years of real decline in rural health, as doctors were not trained up for rural and regional Australia, we have seen no commitment - none - from the ALP to a regional health policy. All we have heard about are last week some health initiatives worth around $148 million. What we have done for rural and regional Australia is worth many, many times that alone. No wonder we have had the National Rural Health Alliance applauding the government, saying that these commitments build on the major boost to rural general practice in the 2000 budget. We have had Dr Julie Thompson, the Chair of the Australian Divisions of General Practice, saying that in the short term the funding set aside for upskilling nurses who are willing to take on additional roles and responsibilities will have a positive effect but in the longer term the scholarships will help. But, in a way, it is all said by the mother of a second year student at the University of Sydney who said:The Australian rural Australia medical undergraduate scholarship has really helped. Our son is enjoying the city but looking forward to returning to the country, and can't wait to be a country doctor.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I say at the outset that the government does not apologise for creating a new structural adjustment program which, in the first instance, will be applied to the Wide Bay-Burnett region. If the citycentric members of the party opposite ever got out of the cities, they would know that this particular area is suffering from very high levels of unemployment and has one of the lowest per capita income levels in this country. When Labor left -  -  - Mr Speaker, this is the bit they do not want to hear. When Labor left the Wide Bay-Burnett area in 1996 with an unemployment rate of nearly 19 per cent they had done nothing but make the problem worse - that is all they had done. The fact is that we have made some progress - a very good local member helps a great deal. Unemployment is down to 14 per cent, which is a vast improvement on what it was when Labor were in power. But that is still too high, and local council and community organisations have been very active in trying to move the region forward. They have come to government as a group seeking structural assistance and have been very active in pulling together ideas and potential. - They have put together individual projects for the Regional Solutions program, some 20 of them, and they have been working hard in their local communities. But this is a region that clearly needs some specific help, and it is for this reason that the government found a way of providing $4 million in funding -   - provided through a current year budgetary underspend on the Regional Solutions program for a structural adjustment program in this very needy area.So let me just pose these questions: does the Labor Party deny that the Wide Bay-Burnett area has high unemployment? Does the Labor Party deny that the region is suffering very great disadvantage? Does Labor support this initiative? No, they do not, because they do not understand the problem. They do not go out to understand it; they do not go out to find solutions. All they do is come into this place and seek to object to every positive intiative we try to put into place to make a difference to battling Australians left behind after 13 years of Labor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and his interest in this area. The Howard government is absolutely committed to providing pharmaceuticals to Australians and making sure that they are as up-to-date, clinically relevant and cost effective as possible. That is why we have been able to find the extra resources for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and why we have been able to keep the scheme up-to-date by regular reviewing it.I am aware, though, of alternate comments, both in a press release of last week and on Sunday Sunrise. In a press release last week the member for Jagajaga said that there had been a huge blow-out in pharmaceutical spending. She should know. In the last five years, between 1996 and 2001, the PBS has increased on average 13 per cent a year. - It is true there was a big increase last year, but the United States had a similar increase, of around 19 per cent. The Labor Party was 4½ per cent higher than us over four years, because of one disastrous year of spending under Labor. - This was 1992-93, when in fact the member for Jagajaga was advising Brian Howe. The increase in the PBS was a record 23.32 per cent. So the member for Jagajaga on her watch managed to get a 23.32 per cent increase one year and a 17.5 per cent increase for Labor over four years, compared to a 13 per cent increase for the coalition. On Sunday Sunrise the member for Jagajaga made five factually inaccurate statements relating to the PBS, and that is the only one that I am attempting to look at. Firstly, she claimed the government did not take the advice of the PBAC on Celebrex. She is simply wrong: the PBAC has no legal right or authority to advise on anything other than listing, and we took their advice on listing. Secondly, she claimed there was no price-volume arrangement for Celebrex. If she had bothered to look through the nearly one metre of documents we gave the Senate on the return to order on the relation of Celebrex and Vioxx, she would see several references to the existence of a price-volume agreement.Thirdly, she claimed that Labor will make sure the PBAC is an independent body. I must say, given recent media attention to the fact that there was an undeclared relationship between a previous PBAC member and the pharmaceutical industry, perhaps our new committee is even more independent. It is very interesting that we hear her talking about independence of the PBAC when I have a letter on file from 2 July 1998 from the member for Jagajaga asking that I not observe normal process and have Aricept on the PBS on the basis of a Herald Sun article. As much as I respect that newspaper, I do not think an article in the Herald Sun is adequate reason to put a drug on the PBS. I table that letter for the advice of honourable members. Further, talking about Naltrexone, she says we should ask the advice of the PBAC as to whether Naltrexone should be on or off. In fact, we have done that and they rejected it. Secondly, we had the Leader of the Opposition on 3AW on 10 July last year saying:... I also support Naltrexone on the PBS ...So much for an independent PBS! He is going to whack it on because there is a bit of political pressure! - You are a hypocrite when you talk. You are an absolute hypocrite when you want to talk about an independent PBAC. - Withdraw which reference? - I withdraw the reference. I just add that people can draw their own inference about someone who says one thing and does another thing. Finally, she claimed that the budget documents did not contain any allowance for extended eligibility of the seniors health card. This came as news to me, because on page 109 of Budget Paper No. 2, down the bottom, under `Acknowledging Older Australians - Extended Eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card', there is in fact detailed allowance of it, under both the Department of Health and Aged Care and the Department of Family and Community Services. I am happy to table the appropriate part out of the budget measures. I am also happy to throw in a tutorial on budget papers, if the honourable member would like it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question, because it does give me the opportunity to explain to her how the independent system of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency works. If she likes, I could perhaps give her a briefing, or arrange for the department to do so, so she understands. Basically, the home concerned was in fact accredited as part of the support visits which continue to take place after accreditation - so that you may not reach accreditation standard and think you will not be visited again for another three years. The fact of the matter is there is a continuing number of support visits and spot checks, both of which occurred in this home. The agency then conducted as a result of that support visit a review audit. The review audit found that there were unsatisfactory ratings on a number of the standards. It has required that that home be brought up to acceptable standard. All of the residents and their families have been written to, and indeed the department is now considering what sanctions will be applied to that home. But the important thing is that it continues to be monitored by both the department and the agency. Whether or not accreditation is downgraded has nothing to do with a ministerial judgment. It is written into the legislation that the agency must remain independent when it makes its decision. The agency takes into consideration the recommendation of the assessor's report. It also takes into account other items that it considers relevant, such as undertakings of the home to remedy the problems in that home. It makes a decision in the interests of the residents as a whole. It is very important that the agency makes that judgment. I might add that the finding was that there was no serious risk. However, both the department and the agency will continue to monitor this home. I report that there were two spot checks over the weekend.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I know his great interest in delivering a quality education to every young person in his electorate. The coalition is committed to equal educational opportunity for young Australians. In the recent budget, government schools get the lion's share of the new measures for schools from the Howard government's most recent budget. The government schools will get an estimated $238 million extra, or 87 per cent of the funding for specific schools measures contained in this year's budget.Government schools have consistently been the beneficiaries of the coalition's sound economic management. The Leader of the Opposition may like to listen to this, because he seems to think that the $105 million he is going to rip off his arbitrary hit list of schools is somehow or other going to be of enormous help to government schools. Let us have a look at the record of this government. Funding for government schools over the five years of this government since 1996 has increased by 42 per cent. In the coming year we will deliver to public education in this country $669 million more than you did when you were in office.This is the sixth federal budget in a row when funding for schools has increased. Of course, it is not merely the funding commitment of this government but it is the fact that we have put in place national literacy and numeracy standards - which the Leader of the Opposition will doubtless dismantle under union pressure. It is the fact that we have put into practice school to work programs which are raising retention rates in many government schools, that show the sincerity and depth of our commitment to public education. But there is a Labor record on this, because we now have budgets coming down for next year from the state Labor governments. Let us have a look at what those budgets have delivered. The New South Wales state budget - which they tried to claim as an education budget - delivered an increase in funding to public education in New South Wales of 2.5 per cent over this year's estimated outcome. The Howard government will deliver to public schools in New South Wales next year an increase of 5.3 per cent - more than double the increase from the Labor Party in New South Wales. And it is not just the New South Wales Labor Party. We now have the Victorian budget, which I have to note was described by the President of the Victorian Branch of the AEU, Mary Bluett, as the `cruellest budget in a decade' for public education. This budget managed an increase of 1.8 per cent in funding for government schools, while the Howard government will be increasing its funding for state schools in Victoria next year by 5.4 per cent - well over double the increase in the funding for public education. Let us have no more of this empty rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition. He delivers nothing but rhetoric. He delivers nothing but cuts to some schools, while this government is going about its business of making sure that there is improved educational opportunity for every young Australian.</DOC>

 - I do not deny workers their just entitlements. In fact, it has been the actions of the Treasurer in my government, my action and also, I might note, the exhortations of the Labor Premier of New South Wales that have resulted, I am pleased to see, in both Mr Keeling and Mr Rich offering substantially, as I understand it, to refund the bonuses that I do not believe they should have been paid in the first place. As to the preliminary report, I have not read it and I do not intend to adopt the extrapolations of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in relation to that. I might add that I am not aware, on my understanding of what the opposition are putting forward, that the legislation they have in mind would achieve the objectives that were outlined by the deputy leader. I would simply make the point to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that you were part of a government that had 13 years to do something about workers' entitlements and you failed miserably for those 13 years to protect any of them.</DOC>

 - I note the member for Hinkler's very real interest in transport matters, which he often pursues me on. Over the last five years the government has made real progress in fixing the aviation safety mess that we inherited from the member for Kingsford-Smith. Under the previous government, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and its predecessor, the CAA, were in an almost permanent state of continual conflict. In less than seven years there were four chairmen, four chief executives, six heads of safety regulation and eight ministerial changes. We have improved CASA's surveillance and enforcement capability. We are well on the way to reforming the aviation regulations. CASA has demonstrated that it is prepared to take tough action against Ansett and Qantas and others when it is needed. In addition to that, I can advise the House that the current chairman, Dr Paul Scully-Power, has asked not to be reappointed due to his other business commitments, including his appointment to the board of Austrade and the National Space Advisory Group. He has done a good job and I wish him well for the future. The government has appointed Ted Anson as the Chairman of CASA for three years from 1 July 2000.  - Mr Anson is currently the Chairman of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is CASA's sister authority. He is very well qualified for this position. He is a calm, tough, independent minded and no-nonsense chairman. They are the qualities that I want in the chair of that organisation. The government has reappointed Mr Mick Toller as Director of Aviation Safety for a period of three years. He has shown over the last three years that he is prepared to take whatever action is necessary to protect the travelling public. He has not been cowed by controversy or by the special pleadings of interest groups. One of Mr Anson's briefs will be to consider whether CASA's existing board structure is appropriate for a safety regulator with enormous enforcement powers. Mr Anson will report to the government in the middle of next year about whether CASA should remain a statutory authority with its own board or whether it should have a new reporting arrangement along the lines of the Australian Federal Police or Australian Customs Service. I will be issuing Mr Anson with a new charter letter, an updated charter letter, after the board has had - this is very important - a series of consultative meetings with the industry, and in particular with the general aviation sector.Our measured approach to aviation reform is in stark contrast to the opportunism of the members opposite, whose only policy is to flap around from one media event to the other, dragging down the public confidence in Australia in relation to Australia's air safety record. The member for Batman's most notable contribution recently was to call for another inquiry into CASA. It is a traditional opposition tactic: when you do not know what you are talking about, you demand an inquiry. I just want to place on record that there have been more than 15 inquiries into the operation of CASA or its predecessor, the CAA, over the last 11 years. CASA's strengths and weaknesses are well known. What is needed is stability and focus, and that will be provided by the team that I have announced today.</DOC>

 - The basis of the Leader of the Opposition's question is utterly wrong. He talks about two cases: One.Tel and National Textiles. He completely ignores the action taken by the government to rescue the workers of the Oakdale mining company. He completely forgets the fact that the government took very vigorous action and that I and my office were very personally involved in relation to Cobar mines. We took very vigorous action in relation to Cobar mines. Of course, we introduced for the first time ever a scheme. The Leader of the Opposition reads out a long list of companies. One company I do not think he read out was that abattoir at Scone, where -  -  - He did? Maybe he should send a copy of it to the Labor Premier of New South Wales, because those meat workers at Scone were denied by the New South Wales government the support that the New South Wales government was willing to give in relation to National Textiles and indeed what the New South Wales government had indicated it might do in relation to others. The reality is that this is the first government to ever introduce an entitlements scheme. The reason it was possible in some cases for people to get their full entitlements is that in those cases the state governments came to the party. In relation to all of these other cases that have occurred since 1 January last year, when the government scheme came into operation, we are willing to pay 50 per cent. We think it is right and proper that the state governments should pick up the other 50 per cent.Instead of asking questions about this in the parliament, the Leader of the Opposition should be exerting his influence on the Labor Premier of New South Wales, the Labor premiers of Queensland and Victoria and the Labor Premier of Western Australia. I will continue to exhort the Liberal Premier of South Australia to do the right thing also, because I am not impressed with the failure of the Liberal government of South Australia to come to the party either. The reality is that the only government in this country which has done something for workers' entitlements is the coalition government I lead. The lot opposite had 13 years. You saw thousands upon thousands of Australian workers go begging for their entitlements, and you did nothing to help them. You have suddenly discovered a conscience for the workers of Australia now that you are in opposition. The workers of Australia are not very impressed with that. </DOC>

 - I can inform the member for La Trobe - I thank him for his question - and members of the House that yesterday under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act I gave approval, subject to conditions, to a dual listing of BHP Ltd and Billiton and a merging of their business. The merger of these two businesses will create one of the largest diversified resource groups in the world, with a market value of around $57 billion. This government believes that it is important for Australian companies to go global. We also believe that those companies can find corporate headquarters in Australia under a business tax regime and a business regime which are very conducive to investment.BHP has an icon status in Australia. It is known as the `big Australian'. We have put in place a number of conditions to ensure that it will continue to be Australian, notwithstanding that it now becomes the largest diversified resources company in the world. Among the conditions that I put in place when giving the approval were that BHP remains an Australian resident company incorporated under our Corporations Law and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange; that it is the ultimate holding company of and manages the BHP businesses currently part of the group; that the global headquarters of BHP and Billiton are located in Australia; that this is acknowledged in all significant public announcements and documents; that the chief executive officer has a principal place of residence in Australia; and that a majority of board meetings are held in Australia. These are conditions which will ensure that BHP, after it becomes the world's largest diversified resources company, continues to have its corporate headquarters in Australia.Of course, when I was making this decision I went looking for precedents. I was unable to find any because the last case of a dual listed company merger was between CRA and RTZ in December 1995, when the now member for Kingston was advising the Labor Party, and no conditions whatsoever were put as to Australian headquarters or Australian residence. - The Socialist Left member for Melbourne interjects. - The member for Melbourne interjects, so I remind him of the conditions that the Labor Party imposed in relation to the dual listing of CRA and RTZ. He was then in the parliament supporting the government. They had two conditions: that one-third of the board be Australians and that CRA's allocation include Latin America. I will table that. They were the conditions on 13 December 1995. On 20 December 1995 -  seven days later - those two conditions were withdrawn and replaced with other conditions that had no requirements whatsoever in relation to headquarters or Australian residence. I will table both of those.  - The Leader of the Opposition gets asked about the BHP-Billiton approval today: Mr Beazley, do you support the approval of the BHP-Billiton merger by the Treasurer?Answer: Well, I have always had my concerns about the Billiton-BHP merger.Question: Would your government have done anything differently?Answer: It is very difficult to tell because I am aware of the fact that when we were in government we were constantly jawboning with companies on these sorts of issues and on the things that we were doing.Can anyone imagine the Leader of the Opposition jawboning? Prolix answering maybe. And then he had one of the most prolix answers you have ever seen when he said this:It is very difficult to say exactly in which direction you would have taken it.In other words, `We wouldn't have a clue what to do about it.' The Labor Party would not have a clue what to do about it. He finishes off by saying:It is very difficult for us to tell what our policy is.That took me back to the Woodside-Shell decision. I made the decision in relation to Woodside and Shell, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition came out and attacked it immediately, and we have had this weaseling all over the place in relation to foreign investment ever since, both by him and by his leader. What have they been saying in relation to Shell and Woodside? He was asked about it on the Glen Milne program on 29 April.Milne: The government took a tough decision on Shell Woodside and the takeover there. You took several days to respond. You were accused of dithering. Were you?Beazley: No, certainly not. Look, on the, as far as Woodside is concerned, on day one we accepted the government's decision.Milne: Well, you say you accept it, but do you support it?Beazley: As I said, we accept the decision. It is over, finished, gone, out of it.Mr Speaker, they still have not announced their position in relation to Shell and Woodside. They took opportunistic attacks, led by the biggest opportunist in this parliament, the member for Hotham. The biggest opportunist in this parliament attacked the decision: he can't bring himself to support it. He weaseled all over the place in relation to BHP-Billiton. When we look at your record, there was not one condition in relation to Australian residence in the dual listing of CRA and RTZ. You do not have the wit to take a decision on anything. You have no policy. You are completely opportunistic, and you are unfit to be in government in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and recognise the interest he has in Indonesia. The member for Boothby has been to Indonesia on several occasions and as recently as about 18 months ago. It is a credit to him that he shows such interest in this issue. The House may be interested to know that it is now 271 days since the member for Kingsford-Smith asked me a question on anything, and `Danger Man' is away today.  -  - No, he has come back. This, indeed, is good news. The Australian government attaches great importance to our relationship with Indonesia. We have a constructive relationship which is based on the principle of mutual respect. Of course the relationship went through a difficult time as a result of the events in East Timor in 1999, and that was to be expected, but there has been a useful rebuilding of the relationship. The ministerial meeting which we held in Canberra in December last year and the visit to Indonesia by Mr Vaile, the Minister for Trade, with a very substantial trade delegation earlier this year underline the value we place on the relationship. It is also, I am sure, of interest to the House that our exports to Indonesia in the last year increased by 35 per cent. I do not think the House will forget that, when Indonesia was in grave economic difficulties in 1997, Australia offered support through the IMF of around $1 billion. Add to that our support for the Paris Club process of debt relief for Indonesia and the very substantial aid contribution and you can see that it is a comprehensive and successful relationship.The House knows that Indonesia is going through troubled times at the moment. We have very deliberately maintained contact with many of the key players there. The foreign minister has been on the phone to me from time to time about it. Our officials in Jakarta have kept in touch with a number of different people. It is a difficult period and we hope those problems will be resolved in a constitutional and peaceful way. Beyond that, obviously, we are not going to become involved.The second part of the honourable member's question was to ask whether there is an alternative view on how the relationship with Indonesia should be handled. The short answer is that there is not one alternative view; there are several alternative views - several different approaches from Labor's various spokespeople for foreign affairs. Uniquely, the Labor Party has several spokesmen on foreign affairs, not one. The relationship between them, I would say, is not particularly warm. I am told and I have read that the relationship between the member for Griffith and the member for Kingsford-Smith -  known within the Labor Party as `Danger Man' - is particularly poisonous. I deal with the Labor Party on foreign affairs issues from time to time, and that is very apparent to me. But in relation to Indonesia, it is very interesting because the member for Griffith makes the point over and over again that a Labor government's approach to dealing with Indonesia would be a combination of Evansism, Keatingism and Hawkeism, and I suppose that means Beazleyism as well, he having been the Minister for Defence throughout all of that period. This is all wrapped together, in stark contrast to the position that the member for Kingsford-Smith takes, which is to go around, as he did in Jakarta recently, criticising the former Labor government and saying:I don't think it - being Labor's policy on Indonesia - served us well at the end of the day.On the one hand you have the member for Griffith, with experience of foreign affairs matters, articulating that Labor would continue with the Keating-Hawke approach; on the other hand you have the member for Kingsford-Smith, who is ever devious in the public comments he makes. That begs the question: where is the Leader of the Opposition in all of this? He says at a doorstop, `We're divided, and it is creative to have divisions between the chairman of the caucus committee and the spokesman on foreign affairs.' But what does the Leader of the Opposition think about the relationship with Indonesia? Is it Keatingism and Hawkeism? Is that the approach of the Leader of the Opposition, or is he going down the Brereton path and continually criticising his predecessors, including himself?  All I can say is that this is not an opposition which would be worthy of government. This is not an opposition that has policies. This is not an opposition that has any sense of direction. This is not an opposition that has been anything but abominably expedient on foreign affairs issues over and over again. None of us will forget Danger Man running around there, launching an attack on the Americans, lining up with the so-called New Zealandisation of Australian foreign policy, and then one fine day out comes the Leader of the Opposition, and bang: `We are with the Americans on missile defence. Forget Danger Man. He is not to be taken seriously.' He is not to be taken seriously; nor is the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. He is a great supporter of the cadets in his electorate - I know because he has told me about them. He has an Army unit at Merredin and a couple of naval cadet units at Esperance and Dampier. I am sure that cadet units around the country will be delighted with the announcement made by my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, Dr Nelson, of the government's support for cadets. The government is putting more money into cadets - another $6 million. We are also integrating cadets more closely with the Defence Force. We see cadets as a very important youth development program. It is also a great introduction to the military. Some of the senior people today in the Australian Defence Force got their first interest in the military through the cadets. The government is very supportive of cadets. Furthermore, in that support for cadets we have tapped into strong community support. I do commend the parliamentary secretary for the fact that we have had the Courier-Mail come out with an editorial - I have just plucked out a selection of articles - and the Advertiser came out in support of cadets. It said:The Victorian government leading the charge - that is, against cadets - asserts it is upholding an anti-gun policy. But to deny weapons training to Defence Force cadets makes about as much sense as teaching gardening without touching a plant or hairdressing without scissors.The West Australian's headline was `Value in cadet system revamped'. It said:Experience in the cadets teaches young people the value of discipline and how to work in a team. It also allows them to develop a range of skills, including leadership.To take one regional newspaper, the Bendigo Advertiser also came out with an editorial strongly supporting the government's measures. This is a long-term program which the government has put in place. It is part and parcel of the government's overhaul of defence and it was of course given priority in the government's defence white paper.I am asked sensibly whether there is any alternative policy. The only alternative and negative comment with respect to cadets is coming from senior people within the Labor Party: we have had the Premier of Tasmania, the Premier of New South Wales and the Premier of Victoria, all of whom are attacking this particular proposal, and of course the Premier of Western Australia - the home state for the member for Kalgoorlie. This should hardly come as a surprise. If you go back in time, when Whitlam was elected he abolished the cadets. When the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, was defence minister and a senior member of the previous Labor government, they downgraded cadets. When the shadow minister was asked about it, his basic response was, `The money should have been spent somewhere else in defence.' - I thank the shadow minister and his colleagues, who are all nodding and interjecting in support of him, because what they are saying is that if the Labor Party are elected they will cut into defence just as they did previously. That is very clear, because not only do they not support cadets but we have also seen in recent days their response to the question, `Where is the money coming from for roll-back?' The Leader of the Opposition was pretty clear when he was asked on Sunday. He said, `Saul Eslake has a list and you can have a look at that list.' When you look at his list, what is on it? None other than defence.So what do we have? We have the Labor Party going around quite openly saying that when it comes to funding some other programs - yet to be defined - they are going to cut defence funding. They are not just going to cut cadets of course; they have a whole range of programs. That is why you have this so-called incredible policy from the Leader of the Opposition, who says, `I'll tell you the details of my defence policy after the election.' It is the old trick back to 1993 - the same old trick - and the Labor Party think the public is mug enough to fall for the same trick. This government are proud of what they have done for cadets. We will continue to support cadets. Dr Nelson has done a fantastic job supporting cadets. I know that communities around Australia will support what the government are doing, and I think it is about time the Leader of the Opposition finally committed himself to this great program for young people.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member's question, I was answering a question in a letter to the editor of the Australian in relation to a letter that had been written by someone regarding the $25,000 ex gratia payment by the government. It was all in the budget papers. It was quite clear -  -  - I hope that members on the other side of the House understand that it is up to the veterans what they do with that $25,000 ex gratia payment from this government. Not all veterans would put it into an income bearing deposit account; some may spend it and others may want to go on a holiday. So I am not going to pre-empt what a veteran may do with that $25,000 payment. I remind the opposition that it was the opposition that introduced deeming on income for people on payments from the Commonwealth. The whole idea of deeming was to make sure that money that was saved by someone depositing it into a savings account could earn money to make them better off.I could help the other side of the House by encouraging former POWs to put the money into an interest bearing deposit account - if they want to - to make themselves better off. Someone, for example, on a maximum rate service pension who has less than $31,000 in a bank account - which includes the $25,000 ex gratia payment - will actually have an overall increase in income of $33.65 per fortnight. In other words, we are trying to encourage veterans to use the money - in this case, their POW ex gratia payment - to help themselves and make themselves better off. In other words, it is a benefit for those who want to save it. But to those who want to spend it I say that is up to them. It is not up to the government to decide where veterans spend the ex gratia payment that this government paid. I hope that the other side of the House continues to support this payment to ex-prisoners of war of Japan.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question that he has put to me and for his interest in this matter. Honourable members would be well aware that the way in which we deal with unlawful arrivals has not changed over a large number of years. In fact, the present method of dealing with the detention of those people who arrive in Australia unlawfully and clandestinely was public policy introduced by a former Labor government to define what in fact had been government policy over previous years to deal with what were largely stowaways. It was good public policy, and the reason for it was quite clear: it allowed a check to be made of the identities of people who arrived, largely, without documents. It allowed checks to be made as to whether or not people pose a risk with regard to health, character or security or pose a threat to Australia. It ensured that people were available for processing when they made applications and that they are available for removal if they have no right to stay in Australia. The policy of detention has not changed. It was always intended to be humane. It has never been free of difficulties - let me say that - and it has always been a situation of some delicacy because people do not like being detained, whether it is provided for by law or not.  I thought it might be useful to recall the statistics between 1991 and 1995-96 when former ministers were managing detention. In 1991, 25 people escaped under Minister Hand; in 1992, there were 22; in 1993, there were 10; in 1993-94, there were 19; in 1994-95, there were 162; and in 1995-96, 11 detainees escaped. And this was when far fewer people were held in detention than we have now. Were there other incidents that one would regard as unsatisfactory? There were at that time. In May 1992, Minister Hand had to announce a security review because of the threatened safety of detainees at Port Hedland. In August 1992, detainees staged a rooftop hunger strike at Port Hedland. Five PRC nationals jumped from the roof; two sustained injuries and one was left paralysed. In late 1992, three Cambodian women at Villawood staged a hunger strike over a four-month period, bringing them close to death, which led to the minister having to promulgate regulations to enable the department to direct a physician to force-feed an asylum seeker whose life is at risk. In 1995, as I mentioned before, there was the mass break-out at Curtin detention centre in Western Australia. In June 1995, they had to tighten security at Curtin after rioting, including the taking of hostages, which resulted in the arrest of 19 detainees. In late June 1995, there was a further rooftop demonstration at Port Hedland.Detention is not easy - it never has been - but there needs to be some appreciation that some people do not like being detained and have a desire, whether there is a lawful entitlement or not, to be in the Australian community. Are there other ways of dealing with it? The only other way I have heard of dealing with it is the view that is put that you should release people as soon as they arrive - or, some might argue, that you release them after you have done some preliminary checks. I have heard that that is the way in which they do it in Sweden. I can tell you how they deal with it in Sweden. They say, `Look, when we get around to interviewing somebody, we might find out whether or not they have a health problem.' They say, `When we get around to interviewing them, we might find out whether they are a security risk or a character concern.' The point I am making is that you can say that those issues are of no consequence and that you will release people regardless of them, or you can have a view that they should be dealt with. I happen to have a view, and the government has a view, that people should be dealt with before they are released into the community. But, more importantly, this is the point that I would make: if their objective is to be in the Australian community, would they come forward later and be available for interview, for processing and for removal if they had no lawful basis to be here? Canada has recently moved to implement measures of the same sort that we use, because, when they went out to find people, to interview them, they did not come forward. If you look at what has happened in the United States of America, they have something like 11 million unlawful stayers or overstayers. If you go to the United Kingdom, they have 100,000 failed asylum seekers who essentially have gone underground. Do you think people come forward after they get a decision that is adverse and say, `Thank you very much; the game's up; I'm going home'? The fact is that the United Kingdom is now receiving something like 97,000 asylum seeker applications, three times per capita the numbers that we receive from amongst those who are in the community or those who arrive clandestinely and are detained. What are the alternatives? When I was on the immigration committee, I tested community based organisations who argued for release into the community at earlier points in time. I said to them, `Look, if we were prepared to look at this issue constructively and we were going to process people, and if some are found not to be refugees and we need to remove them, would you help to facilitate their removal - in other words, cooperate in identifying where they are, help to locate them and see that they are removed?' What do you think they said?  Government member - No. - Of course. They said, `That's not our job. That's the department of immigration's job.' I can tell you that, if you have people detained, you can process them, you can do so with efficacy, and you are in a position to have available for removal those people that ought to be removed.  - What does Labor say about these matters? I noticed the member for Grayndler interrupting. Of course, it is difficult to know at times. I listen very carefully, and occasionally I hear Labor saying, `We still support mandatory detention.'  - But what I also hear now coming from the Labor Party, particularly the member for Grayndler, is that he is going to try to change Labor Party policy because he believes their policy has already shifted considerably. What you also have are the Labor unions involved in relation to these matters.  - I understand the Leader of the Opposition. He does not want to hear what the labour movement is saying in relation to these matters. The fact is -  - The fact is that you had Leigh Hubbard of the Victorian Trades Hall Council saying he does not believe in mandatory detention; you have Sharan Burrow saying -  - Thank you for your counsel, Mr Speaker. The ACTU President, Sharan Burrow, says that mandatory detention is a crime. She wants detainees now to be paid wages and overtime for preparing their own meals and doing their own cleaning. The fact is that the union movement and the ALP have been saying to me over a period of time, `We should get tougher on visa overstayers and illegal workers.' But growing sections of the Labor Party are now saying that detention is bad policy. How do they expect that you are able to locate and remove overstayers or people who are working contrary to visa conditions if they are not detained? Do they think they can say, `Look, we've found you, and will you come tomorrow when we put you on the plane?' I think that is what they seem to expect. Is that what they expect? Is that why we have got Premier Beattie in Queensland saying, along with the rest of the Labor Party, `We should be locating people closer to metropolitan centres so that they can be closer to the support groups, but please don't give us one in Brisbane. We want tourists still coming to Brisbane, we want the extra economic benefit that comes from it, but we are not prepared to accept the consequences that result from having increased numbers of people, some of whom may not intend bona fide visits'? Let me say: mandatory detention was good public policy when you operated it and it is good public policy now. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare. Can I say to the honourable gentleman that all of the things that I do in my office as Prime Minister, and I know I can speak with great confidence in relation to the Treasurer and other senior ministers, are in accordance with longstanding practice and our understanding of the entitlements. I regard it as part of my public duty as Prime Minister of this country to visit all parts of the country. I will go on visiting all parts of the country. And I might remind the honourable gentleman that it is my almost invariable practice when I visit electorates - as the member for Forde will attest, as the member for Fairfax will attest, as the member for Wide Bay will attest - that as well as naturally being in the company of the sitting coalition member I also invite community leaders to the functions that I attend. I make a special point in those visits -  - The member for Paterson? Ah, yes, I visit your seat too. It was very enjoyable. What is more -  - What is more, I have even holidayed in your electorate - I love it. -  - Mr Speaker, I regard all of the visits that I have undertaken as being very much within entitlements and they are, of course, completely consonant with the sorts of visits that used to be undertaken by my predecessor and certainly by my predecessor but one. I know my immediate predecessor on one occasion went for a long time before going to a particular state, but certainly my predecessor but one undertook a great number of visits. I think it is important. And I would remind the honourable gentleman, now that he has given me the opportunity to do so, that one of the visits to which he has probably been referring is a visit I paid to Campbelltown and Camden last Thursday. I might point out to the honourable gentleman that the principal function that I attended and the occasion that I met on that particular visit was to be guest of honour at a large fundraising function for Lifeline at Macarthur, which I am very pleased to say raised a large amount of money for a wonderful community service. He also reminds me of my visit to Newcastle -  - I continue the answer. Also, for the information of the honourable member for Calare, I remind him that on a recent visit I paid to Newcastle I was also guest of honour at a major fundraising function to purchase a paediatric oncology unit for the John Hunter Hospital. I am informed that that particular occasion raised a record amount for a charity event within the Newcastle and Hunter district area: it raised an amount of $180,000. In the course of these visits - and I make no bones about it - of course I take the opportunity to advocate the political cause of the government. I make no apology for saying that - just as my predecessors did, just as my colleagues do, just as the Leader of the Opposition does and just as shadow ministers do. I think it is entirely appropriate. Part of our public duty is to put our political case. It is also our duty to discharge our responsibilities as prime ministers and senior ministers, and I think it verges on humbug to think there is something improper about that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As a former minister for agriculture in New South Wales, he would know very well how important and how precious Australia's clean and green image, our disease-free status, is to our nation. This government has massively increased Australia's effort in relation to quarantine, an effort that had been run down by Labor: they had actually reduced services and border patrol activities in their latter years. We immediately commenced turning it around, and there are now more than two-thirds more full-time staff in border activities than when we came to office. But, in the budget handed down last month, there was another $600 million boost to Australia's quarantine services. This demonstrates very clearly this government's commitment to our nation's disease-free status. It will almost double the size of our quarantine service and also significantly boost the number of people engaged by Customs. The number of dog teams will be tripled to 98 and we will have an extra 50 X-ray machines. The number of inspections will increase dramatically, and indeed we will be moving to a 100 per cent inspection of passengers' luggage, cargo containers and, of course, mail items coming into this country.There is a very real commitment by this government to quarantine issues. We regard very highly our quarantine services and the important work that they do, and our disease-free status. It is in fact one of our most important national assets, one that the trade minister and I and others are always talking about to our international customers. Unfortunately, there are some people opposite who do not give such an important priority to quarantine issues. Indeed, there are a range of diseases - not just foot-and-mouth disease, which has attracted so much attention lately - which are of real concern to Australian industries. One, for instance, is the white spot virus in prawns. That is a disease which has potentially the same kind of devastating effects on the seafood industry as does foot-and-mouth disease on livestock. Australia's disease-free status, our freedom from white spot disease, is also an important asset to our seafood industry. I was naturally therefore concerned - indeed appalled - when last month we had the New South Wales fisheries minister, Mr Obeid, announcing that white spot disease had been discovered in Sydney Harbour. He actually went on to make comments that the prawn population was probably already being devastated by white spot virus in Sydney Harbour. Naturally, Mr Obeid's announcement caused shock waves throughout the entire seafood industry, and, indeed, concerns internationally about whether Australia's $2 billion seafood export industry was at risk.  I naturally sought additional tests and asked the CSIRO to do some studies. It seems that the New South Wales minister made his announcement, to get a few headlines, on the basis of a preliminary protein test - an entirely unreliable guide to whether or not the disease is actually present. When the CSIRO did more detailed testing, it became abundantly clear that there was no evidence of white spot disease in Sydney Harbour at all. So we had the New South Wales minister undermining the credibility of the clean and green image of Australia by his attempting to get a cheap headline, rushing around doing an Aquilina to get a cheap headline, caring nothing about the damage to the reputation of our multimillion-dollar seafood export industry. I am pleased to report to the House that there is no evidence of white spot disease in Sydney Harbour nor, for that matter, anywhere else in Australia. It is absolutely disgraceful that we have a state Labor minister rushing around trying to damage our disease-free reputation.I might add one other thing: his action has undermined Australia's tough new quarantine laws in relation to prawn imports. How can we sustain these high standards and demanding testing regimes if we have one of our own state fisheries ministers going around telling the world that we have got the disease that we are trying to keep out of the country? I think it is high time Mr Obeid apologised to the fishing industry. The shadow minister opposite should call him into line and give him the Bracks treatment on barley: pull him into line and make sure that we have a situation in Australia where all people regard highly our disease-free status and are determined to maintain our good quarantine status.</DOC>

 - There is always such a long wait for questions from the member for Dobell that, when they finally arrive, it is a great disappointment because they always have such an insubstantial basis. I will just go through that question point by point - that is the easiest way. This government is of course investing massively in Australian schooling. Government schools in this budget for the coming year will receive some $669 million more than they received under Labor in Labor's last year of office. The member for Dobell did not get it quite right, but the new measures in the budget deliver to government schools some $238 million, which is 87 per cent of the total money flowing from the measures in the budget; 87 per cent flows to government schools. - He raises the enrolment benchmark adjustment. It is not true that the government has abolished the enrolment benchmark adjustment. Unlike the Labor Party, which intends to return that money largely to the New South Wales Treasury and to other state treasuries, we took the view that it was important that that money actually flowed to government schools. And that money will be invested in improving science programs, technology programs, mathematics programs and innovation in government schools. The Labor Party's policy of abolishing the EBA simply means that state treasuries will be able in the future, as they have in the past, to put savings they make from the drift to non-government schools back into the consolidated revenue of the state budget, without any guarantee whatsoever that that money will flow to government schools. The difference between us and the Labor Party on EBA policy is that we intend to make sure that that money gets into government schools, where it can improve facilities for government students. The literacy money is simply embodied already in the forward estimates. That is why it appears as zero in the measures. There is nothing unusual about that; that is standard budgetary practice. The member for Dobell also refers to the government's funding system for non-government schools. That is a system which of course delivers funding on the basis of a needs index, which, in many ways, one has to say, is somewhat similar to the index that the Labor Party used to distribute funding under its disadvantaged schools policy; it accepted that an SES type index was an appropriate index of need. We have put into place that index which delivers the greatest funding per student for the neediest schools and delivers the least funding to schools serving the wealthiest community. For example, Shore Grammar in Sydney will receive by 2004 some $178 extra out of the billions of dollars that flow through this program to needy schools, and SCEGGS Redlands will get about $20 extra.The irony of the policy of the Leader of the Opposition is that, when he takes funding away from his arbitrary hit list of schools - a very unjust and unfair grouping of schools based on a discredited index, the ERI - those schools that will lose least will be the schools serving the wealthiest communities. The schools from which the Leader of the Opposition will take most will be those schools that can least afford it - schools where both parents of students work, struggling to provide an education for their children. For example, the Warwick School on the Darling Downs will lose some $3,000 per student. It is a small community school. SCEGGS Redlands will lose $20 as a result of the Leader of the Opposition's policy, but a community school on the Darling Downs will lose $3,000.The injustice of this policy shows the lazy attitude of the Leader of the Opposition to develop policies. He was not even interested to compile a list of the schools serving the wealthiest communities. From a list of some 67 schools serving the wealthiest communities in Australia, only 23 are on the Leader of the Opposition's list. The rest on the Leader of the Opposition's list do not even fall within that category, because he could not be bothered to do the work. He is too lazy to do the policy work, so he comes up with a morally bankrupt policy which is going to be very unjust and will take most money away from those parents who can least afford it and take least away from the wealthiest in the community. This government is determined to give fair funding and quality education to all Australians, and that is what our funding policies do. We totally reject the unfairnesses and injustices in the opposition's approach.</DOC>

 - To the member for McEwen: thank you for the question. I know that the member for McEwen is one of a number of members who have raised significant issues with the government in relation to the collapse of HIH. The government has today announced that the total of its package of support is $640 million over the next four years, which is fully accounted for in the budget. That money will be added to by payments that we can send to those who are on salary continuance insurance and other forms of insurance before then. In fact, we anticipate that the first cheques will be sent out this Friday to those people who had salary continuance insurance and disability insurance, and that is going to provide them with substantial relief as soon as possible. I will be introducing into the parliament an appropriation bill to account for the $640 million and we would require the parliament to pass that as quickly as possible so that substantial funds can start flowing from 1 July. We will be looking for the support of the Labor Party in expediting the passage of that legislation through this place. I can also add that the work of the HIH Claims Support company, which has been set up by the Insurance Council, is already well under way, and I can advise the House of the appointment of Dallas Booth as the Chief Executive of HCS and that Mr Dick Warburton has agreed to be the Chairman of HCS. There will be an appeals mechanism put in place. For anyone who does not meet the criteria we have established for the hardship support package, there is an appeals package process that we have put in place. That appeals process is going to be chaired by Bill McLennan, who was the head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and he will have a panel that will assess some of the anomalies in the criteria for the package.More than 5,000 people have contacted the HIH hardship hotline following an extensive education program through the media where we have tried to advise as many claimants as possible of the support that the Commonwealth government is providing. In effect, this is an act of compassion from one part of the Australian community to the other. It is very important that people recognise that this is not a precedent for financial services collapses. It is an act of hardship support to help those people who have been hardest hit by the collapse of Australia's second largest general insurer. It is the act of a compassionate community and it is the act of a compassionate government.</DOC>

 - There is something almost pathetic about the reliance of the Leader of the Opposition on the categories of the education resources index. You would think that he would have followed the analysis and demolition of the education resources index over the last few years. There have been several reports on this. He could have had his staff look at these reports. - He just says it's -  - The Leader of the Opposition has just stated - let us just put this in the Hansard on the record - that the ERI is still retained for 70 per cent of the schools. That is absolutely false. - That is absolutely false. The ERI, which Labor used, that unjust, inequitable index which finally lost the support of the entire non-government sector - the Catholic school systems were very keen to see it abolished -  - It shows you the Labor Party has not got the slightest grasp of what has happened. The Catholic -  - The National Catholic Education Commission was one of the strongest supporters of the government in getting rid of that index, the ERI. The Catholic schools are not funded according to the education resources index; they are funded at equivalent level 96 to the SES. - They are funded on a proportion of total government school costs, but they are not funded according to the education resources index. So that index has been abandoned by every group, every section, of the non-government schools that was subject to it. The reason that it has been abandoned is that there was an analysis of this index over several years which showed that it was totally flawed, and the government received a report from KPMG which indicated that it was a completely unsatisfactory index to judge the need of schools. What the Leader of the Opposition has done, in developing his hit-list of schools -  his scapegoat schools - is to retain one category, category 1, from this utterly discredited index, and it was discredited because when you look at the schools grouped in any category there was no obvious rationale for that grouping. That category 1 groups together, as I said in my previous answer, some schools that obviously serve very wealthy communities and they get very little -  - I just named some - SCEGGS Redlands, for example, and Shore, who get very little under our index. And some schools, at the other extreme, are just community schools which have an SES index which indicates that the parents have a level of resources below that of the Catholic parish schools. The Leader of the Opposition has been so lazy in his policy work that he has not even bothered to look at what the list of wealthiest schools in Australia might look like. What he has put together is an arbitrary list drawn from a totally discredited system. It is no wonder that parents of students at these schools are angry. Many of these schools, of course, are in Labor marginal seats, and I have no doubt whatsoever that the anger of these parents will become particularly clear to the Leader of the Opposition as we move towards the election campaign. I know that the member for Melbourne Ports is worried because he has six of these schools in his electorate. The member for Isaacs must be very worried; she should go to the Leader of the Opposition and tell him whether she thinks that Mentone Grammar and Mentone Girls Grammar are rich schools serving rich communities. I am sure that those communities do not believe that that is the case, and those schools have students supported by parents who are working very hard to send them there. The Leader of the Opposition is totally out of touch. He has adopted this policy for one reason and one reason only: he has to placate the extremists of the Australian Education Union, who want all funding to non-government schools abolished. Because he is not prepared to do that, he has decided to offer them a list of scapegoats. He has put forward this hit list, a very unjust list which will impact very unfairly on middle income families and parents and on community schools. It shows his utter unfitness to lead the government of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question, because I know of his very real concern for older Australians in need of care in his own electorate.   - I am very pleased to tell the House about the new system of viability funding for small rural and remote homes, which do not have access to the same capital funding that larger homes in metropolitan areas have. Under the reforms, we introduced the viability funding payment to small homes, and some 211 homes had been receiving some $6 million of funding annually. In the budget for this current financial year, $20.1 million over four years was added to that to enable more homes to receive viability funding, and I am sure the member for Wannon will be pleased to know that the number of homes receiving viability funding in his electorate will go from five to 24. I also would think that the member for Capricornia would feel very pleased that, under the new system with over 500 homes receiving viability funding, in her electorate the Pioneers Hostel, with 29 places, will receive viability funding of $8.95 per day and will receive $94,736 per annum in a full year for 100 per cent occupancy. In addition to that, it is important to say that we have introduced a new and simpler formula. We are now using the ARIA measure, the accessibility/remoteness index of Australia, which the ABS is adopting. That will be a major concern for points. The size of the home is also important and whether or not the home caters for 50 per cent or more residents who have special needs - that includes people of non-English-speaking backgrounds, veterans, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. The other important point to make about viability funding is that previously people had to apply to get it. In consulting with the industry, we have changed those rules so that now it will be paid automatically. Once a home reaches the criteria, it will be paid automatically. Because it was money in this financial year's budget, it will be paid retrospectively to 1 January 2001.</DOC>

 - I remark by way of a preamble in my answer that that is an interesting way of framing a question about the outstanding national accounts that we have received. Last Friday, the Leader of the Opposition put out a statement about the economy under the heading `The economy - all the government's own work'. We will come to that later in question time. What have we done? We have a scheme. For 14 years, those opposite had no scheme. And, worse than that, not only do we have a scheme and they did not have a scheme, but the Leader of the Opposition, as well as talking down the economy, has been running around Australia encouraging state governments not to support our scheme. There are thousands of Australian workers that have their entitlements because of our scheme. For 13 years, their fellow workers went begging for their entitlements. Is the Leader of the Opposition now advancing the proposition that we should have a taxpayer funded scheme that would guarantee repayment of all creditors in relation to a company? That is what he is really suggesting. - A non-taxpayer funded scheme. The Leader of the Opposition talks about an entitlement scheme that is funded by a new tax. The Beazley mantra is: if you have a problem, get a new tax. That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition is doing. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, through you, Mr Speaker, that raising questions about entitlements, raising questions about One.Tel, will not absolve the Leader of the Opposition from the responsibility that he now has - to apologise to the Australian people for disgracefully talking down the Australian economy over the last three months. That is what the Leader of the Opposition has to do because, for the last three months, he has been running around Australia trying desperately to depress the Australian community as much as possible. I am proud to say that the Australian community, Australian consumers and Australian business men and women have ignored the doomsaying talk of the Leader of the Opposition and they have come through with flying colours.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. I can inform the House that the national accounts for the March quarter, which were released at 11.30 this morning, showed that in the March quarter the Australian economy grew by 1.1 per cent. It was supported by strong outcomes in nearly all areas. Household consumption grew by 2.2 per cent, the strongest quarterly growth since September 1994. Services growth was 4.2 per cent, the strongest growth in 25 years. Investment in new plant and machinery rose by two per cent in the March quarter. Net exports contributed a 0.8 percentage point to GDP. Non-farm average earnings grew by a strong 1.6 per cent in the quarter. Private corporate profits rose by 7.8 per cent in the quarter and are now at historical highs at around 25 per cent of GDP. The only area that was detracting from growth in the March quarter was a run-down in inventories. It now appears that that was because consumption was stronger than expected and that business will rebuild inventories in the quarters to come. Supported by a turnaround in the construction industry, with the government's First Home Owners Scheme and low interest rates, construction in coming quarters will start adding to GDP. The 1.1 per cent growth in the March quarter, notwithstanding a weaker world environment, is one of the strongest results amongst the industrialised economies of the world. All Australians will welcome the fact that growth was strong in the March quarter - that is, all Australians except those sitting opposite. Hoping for a weak quarterly result, the Leader of the Opposition went to open his by-election campaign in Aston today. And down there in Aston today, before the national accounts were released, he claimed that the Aston by-election would be fought on economic management - presumably proud of his record as employment minister when unemployment was 11.3 per cent, of his record when he was finance minister when the budget deficit was $13 billion and that, when he was last in government and the Labor Party held Aston, home mortgage interest rates paid by the electors of Aston were 17 per cent. Today they are 6.8 per cent. There he was, down in Aston, a'wishin' an' a'hopin' an' a'thinkin' an' a'prayin' that today's result would be a bad one.Mr Speaker, just when you thought you had seen the biggest opportunist in Australian politics, the ABC reminded us of the member for Hotham. The results came out at 11.30 today and on the World Today at 12 o'clock the ABC reported the following:The World Today was hoping to speak to Opposition treasury spokesman Simon Crean after the release of the figures today. A short time ago Mr Crean's office told us he was too busy to talk to the ABC.Well, he wasn't too busy last quarter, Mr Speaker. He wasn't too busy last quarter, a'hopin' an' a'wishin' an' a'thinkin' an' a'prayin'. Good news for Australia; bad news for the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, but there is no need for him to look so despondent that growth is so strong. It is actually good news for Australia. To take it as bad news in the way in which you have asked your question does not show an affinity with the Australian public that wants to see strong growth in its economy. You asked me about the effect of tax changes on spending -  - I am asked about the effect of tax changes in relation to spending. I remind the honourable member that household consumption grew by 2.2 per cent. Not only did it grow by 2.2 per cent but it was the strongest since September of 1994. So, if tax changes were dampening consumption, why would it be the strongest since 1994? One of the reasons why it could be the strongest since 1994 is that every Australian income taxpayer has had an income tax cut, the largest income tax cut in Australian history, and now people have more money to spend - money working its way out into the Australian economy. Let me give you another fact. The growth in consumption was underpinned by strong services growth - the strongest growth in services for 25 years. You would have thought that the tax changes would have been dampening in relation to services, but, as I said at a press conference earlier, the fact that every Australian has had an income tax cut means that they have more money in their pockets to now spend.This is the government that has had the courage to do the big changes which will set Australia up for decades. We have been opposed every step of the way by an opposition that now wants to keep the changes that we put in place, by an opposition which has been weak, directionless and opportunistic, and it follows its leader in that regard.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for drawing my attention to some of the more extravagant political rhetoric of the past few months. - I always listen very carefully to the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition because they provide you with so many vignettes. I always listen very carefully. And immediately after the December quarter national accounts came down, I heard a mantra from the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, overjoyed as they were with the prospect that they might be able to derive some political advantage out of those aberrant account figures for the December quarter, despite the explanations that had been given, not only by the Treasurer and by me but also by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, to the effect that those figures represented the particularly severe transitional impact of the tax changes on the housing industry, in relation to which the government took immediate action - in fact, within two days of the accounts coming out - which is now putting a great deal of stimulus back into the housing industry. Their mantra was that the GST had mugged the economy.Distressed as they were at the smooth acceptance of the GST at that stage, the Labor Party - I have to say, very deliberately on this occasion - aided and abetted by large sections of the Australian media, reported those December quarter accounts in very alarmist language. I think particularly of a headline in the Sydney Morning Herald that followed the December quarter accounts and screeched `Australia hits the wall'. Well, after that, I would expect the headline tomorrow from that broadsheet to be saying `Australia roars back' - because in reality that is what has happened.The mantra of the Leader of the Opposition was that the GST had mugged the Australian economy. That was always a false claim, but nowhere is it more accurately and convincingly repudiated than in the point made in the Treasurer's release on the national accounts this morning, when he said that household consumption grew by 2.2 per cent in the March quarter, the strongest quarterly growth since September 1994. He then went on to say, quoting the national accounts themselves, that the growth in consumption was underpinned by exceptionally strong services growth of 4.2 per cent, the strongest in 25 years. The significance of that in relation to the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition is that anybody who understands our tax system knows that it was the services sector of the Australian economy that had the goods and services tax applied to it for the first time, because the services sector of the Australian economy did not carry indirect tax before the introduction of the goods and services tax. So, if you were arguing that the goods and services tax was mugging the economy, you would have to assert and demonstrate that the part of the economy it mugged the most was in fact the services sector; yet, in reality, the services sector over the last quarter has roared ahead, and was the best in 25 years. Over the last three months we have seen a determined attempt by the Australian Labor Party to depress and confuse the Australian people, to talk down their confidence, to rob them of hope about their future. And they have been aided and abetted, I regret to say, by sections of the media. But, true to their character, the Australian people have won through. These national accounts are a tribute to the Australian people. They are a tribute to the consumers in Australia and a tribute to the investing small business men and women of the Australian community. I thank the Australian people for their faith in their future and I utterly condemn the negative tactics of the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - My understanding in relation to the workers' entitlements is that, even before the contributions offered - and they were conditionally offered - by Mr Rich and Mr Keeling, there were sufficient resources within the company to meet -  - Well, that is the information. The honourable gentleman who asked the question may have a superior fund of knowledge on this than I have, but my understanding -  - I am trying to be generous to the honourable gentleman. He may have a superior fund of knowledge on this. Some of his colleagues from Queensland are not being very generous about his frontbench future; and it is spreading. A few people have got him marked down, too. I think that fellow called Ludwig has got him in his gun sights. -  - My understanding is that there were resources and sufficient assets there to meet the workers' entitlements, even without the contributions, if they come through, of Mr Keeling and Mr Rich. I say in relation to that that there is an element of conditionality in relation to their commitments. I would hope that those bonuses are paid back, irrespective of whether the money comprising the bonuses is needed for the workers' entitlements. The clear difference between this case and National Textiles was that there were no bonuses in the case of National Textiles. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I expected to be asked by the Labor Party about that survey yesterday, but I am pleased that she has picked up that I had not been. The ACCI-Westpac industrial trends survey for the June quarter showed that business confidence recovered sharply in June. Of most significance was the sharp increase in new orders and output. There was a 100 per cent turnaround from a negative six to a positive six in respect of output and, consistent with this increase in new orders and output, profit expectations firmed. Seventy per cent of respondents reported improved or similar conditions for the June quarter compared with the March quarter.As we have seen in the national accounts, the profit growth in the March quarter and profit as a share of the economy were very strong. A positive turnaround in business sentiment was assisted by strength seen in exports. A strong turnaround in exports was reported in the June quarter with a more than doubling of the proportion of respondents reporting a rise. Eighty-seven per cent of respondents expect exports to improve or to remain the same over the next three months, and that will be supported by the fact that, under the government's tax reforms, we no longer tax Australian exports. This is of enormous benefit to rural Australia. Rural Australia, a part of our great export industries, is now exporting to the world under the same terms and conditions as everybody else allowed their exporters to go out into the world - that is, tax free. Under the Australian Labor Party's system of wholesale sales taxes, which cascaded into businesses, Australian exporters were cheated. They did not have the same opportunities.We have some of our friends from New Zealand in the gallery today. New Zealand back in the 1980s had the courage to reform its taxation system. I think it was done by a Labor government in New Zealand, and it was supported by the National Party on a bipartisan basis. People from the New Zealand parliament would be interested to know that there is one political party left in the free world that opposes a value added tax, giving preference to narrow indirect wholesale sales taxes on goods. And that political party is not based in Swaziland; it is somewhere in this chamber. It is the last political party in the free world to prefer wholesale sales taxes on an indirect goods base rather than a value added tax. If you believe them, 150 countries in the world have got it wrong and the only people who know the truth govern the Labor Party and Swaziland. The truth of the matter is that even the Labor Party do not actually take that view. The truth of the matter is that they are just a pack of opportunists who want this government to do all of the hard work and then hope to slide into office and to take the advantage of it.I was asked about the ACCI-Westpac survey for June, which was very positive. It is at odds with the surveys of Dun and Bradstreet. Dun and Bradstreet, which the Labor Party likes to rely on, has produced the most negative survey. It has done as much as it could to contribute to negative sentiment on a regular basis - along with the Labor Party - over recent quarters, including the claim which was made on the 7.30 Report on 13 March 2001 by a spokesman from Dun and Bradstreet that we were likely to have three negative quarters. Of course, that was picked up by the Leader of the Opposition who, on 14 March 2001, said, `This is an Australian home-grown recession.' During the March quarter, on 14 March, when the Australian economy was growing at 1.1 per cent, he made that claim. We now know that in the quarter ending 31 March the economy grew at 1.1 per cent, which for the March quarter would be the strongest of any of the major economies of the world. You were out there making those claims on 14 March 2001. You know you were irresponsible. You know you did it for political advantage. You were trying to get negative sentiment. You were trying to have self-fulfilling prophesies. You were not acting in the best interests of the Australian people. You have no commitment to their interests - and you are not fit to govern in Australia! </DOC>

Did I use any or misuse any of my entitlements? No. - Does this company or this individual receive any contracts from the federal government? No. Does he provide any financial support to me personally? No. Does he provide financial support to the Liberal Party? He has donated in the past and I am quite sure that he will donate in the future -  - as he has also run these courses for other organisations such as Rotary and Lions.

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. Indeed I congratulate her too on becoming the chair of the government foreign affairs, defence and trade committee, which she has recently taken over, and I know she will make a very fine chair of that committee.Since the government came to office in 1996, we have adopted a practical approach to advancing the interests of Australia and Australians. It is not that we are opposed to the notion of good international citizenship - of course we like to be good international citizens - but our objective in foreign policy is the promotion of the national interest. The core of what we are about in foreign policy is standing up for Australia, for our national security, for the jobs and the living standards of Australians and, importantly, for Australians who are travelling abroad when they get into genuine difficulties.The honourable member asked whether there are any alternative approaches. Yesterday I was asked whether there was an alternative approach and I explained there were several approaches, and I repeat today that one of the alternative approaches is the idiosyncratic opportunism of the member for Kingsford-Smith. When you look at some of the statements that the opposition have made on foreign policy, I really think they do, for a change, bear a little scrutiny. After all, it is just six months or so until the next election, the opposition presenting itself as the alternative government, and I think it is only fair that the statements of the opposition be subjected to some scrutiny. The House, I know, is aware of the curious statements the member for Kingsford-Smith has made about missile defence and his raising of questions about the future of the joint facilities with the United States, a position which was rectified rather hastily - and in embarrassing circumstances during a visit by a senior American official - by the Leader of the Opposition.What else has the opposition been proposing in foreign affairs? The member for Kingsford-Smith, in 1999, was saying we should put the relationship with Indonesia on the line; we should terminate the relationship. In 2000-01, he has been saying the Prime Minister should run up to Indonesia - which would be interpreted in Indonesia as an apology for our East Timor policy, something we on this side of the House will not do.When the coup came in Fiji, the member for Kingsford-Smith said that this country should impose economic sanctions on Fiji and crush its economy. How fair would that have been and how sensible would that have been! When the coup erupted in the Solomon Islands, we were told by the member for Kingsford-Smith and others in the opposition, such as the member for Denison, that Australia should send troops -  - Like you wanted to send troops into Fiji during the first coup - remember that? - we should send troops into the Solomon Islands to solve the problem there. When we had a human rights dialogue with China, I would have thought that the member for Kingsford-Smith and the opposition would have supported a human rights dialogue with China, because the opposition says that human rights will be at the heart of their foreign policy. But they attacked the human rights dialogue with China. The member for Kingsford-Smith said it was `Chamberlainesque' to have a human rights dialogue with China and so, if Labor were elected, they would scrap the dialogue but they would build up relations with China. We have a human rights training program with Burma, and the Labor Party says it is opposed to helping develop human rights in Burma but it has a human rights policy.The fact is that these opportunistic statements by the member for Kingsford-Smith, I can only say, would make Australia a laughing stock if they were implemented. And the point is that I am not alone in making this allegation. I am joined by the member for Griffith, because if there is a member of the opposition who knows something about foreign policy it is the member for Griffith. When the member for Griffith writes articles - and he has written, he claims, 40 to 50 articles - about foreign policy, you would think the member for Kingsford-Smith would be pleased and you would think the Leader of the Opposition would be pleased - one of your backbenchers out there writing articles and putting the party's position and so on - but apparently not. The member for Kingsford-Smith is not pleased and sends a letter to some 35 members of the caucus condemning the member for Griffith for writing all these articles and for being outspoken. `Why?' asks the member for Griffith. `Have I been breaching Labor Party policy?' `No,' says the member for Kingsford-Smith, `you haven't.' `Actually,' the member for Kingsford-Smith says, `you're pretty good on policy' - as if he would know. `The problem is the nuances' - as if the member for Kingsford-Smith would know anything about nuance. How laughable is that. I will tell you what the nuance is: the member for Griffith knows something about foreign policy and the member for Kingsford-Smith is a cheap opportunist. That is the nuance. Is this my view? We do not always agree with the Courier-Mail -  - Very rarely, but we do today, I can tell you. The Courier-Mail had an editorial, and I think the House would be interested in it:This stoush - the stoush between the member for Kingsford-Smith and the member for Griffith - would have stayed in the background if it was acknowledged within the party - being the Labor Party - that Mr Brereton was best equipped to decide Labor's foreign policy.The Courier-Mail goes on to say:But he is not.And that is right: he is not. If there is one great Labor icon, it is Gough Whitlam - I think everyone over there would agree - and he described the member for Kingsford-Smith as `shallow, shabby and shonky'; and I think that is very well put.</DOC>

 - It is quite obvious why there is no employment services policy on the opposition side: because they have nothing better to do with their time than mudrake. I have not discussed the price of the course with Marc Ratcliffe. What I am aware of is that Marc actually provides his time free of charge to whichever organisation it is; he is donating that time. I do not know how much he is donating to the Liberal Party. Whatever it is, I will gratefully accept it into the Liberal Party's efforts, because he is a businessman who recognises that only one side of politics is going to look after the economy of this country. Today we have seen a growth rate of 1.1 per cent in the economy, and that is why you do not want to talk about it. You do not want to talk about things that you do not want to hear about.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this area. General practice is the cornerstone of primary health care in Australia, and it does have some legitimate gripes. This has been particularly so since 1992 when the previous Labor government instituted half-indexation of GP rebates despite having promised not to do so, and general rebates have lagged in some circumstances. I was keen, in trying to address this, not just to give money to doctors but also to try to get some health outcomes for the public, and I believe that the budget has done that. We have tried to address this in two different ways. The first is through a quantum of money to restructure the schedule: $300 million over four years to try to get away from one of Medicare's big failings - that is, the fact that the time tiering recognises five minutes and 25 minutes but nothing in between, which rewards doctors who have a large number of very quick services. By trying to encourage longer consultations, we will be rewarding high quality general practice.The second part of the strategy involves five different areas where we engage general practice to try and get health outcomes for the Australian public - diabetes, asthma, cervical cancer, mental illness and engagement of practice nurses. These are exciting areas. In diabetes we are attempting to do something no country in the world has done before, and that is pay doctors for outcomes for their patients, thereby linking good diabetic management and a reduction in complications with rewards for general practitioners. With asthma we do something that Medicare has never really done, and that is pay doctors to see people when they are well, not when they are sick. With mental illness we are spending $120 million over four years to engage doctors in longer consultation items for counselling - again, something Medicare has never done previously. Medicare has been focused on chemical treatments for depression and mental illness, not on non-chemical means.The engagement of practice nurses again recognises that nurses, working in conjunction with general practice, can get very good health outcomes. One of the more exciting areas for me is the $72 million being spent on cervical cancer. We can prevent 90 per cent of cervical cancer in Australia. At the moment, we are probably preventing only 50 per cent of it - 36 per cent of women are not getting screened, and these are the women who are at particularly high risk.The honourable member asked if I had had any other recent comments, and there are two that I can relate to him. The first is in the Leader of the Opposition's speech, where he is in fact not going to proceed with the government's cervical cancer initiative and instead is going to institute his own. This would be a great pity and shows that the Labor Party has not learnt anything from its disastrous failure in immunisation. You cannot get an outcome like this unless you engage general practice. If you attempt to set up a whole series of new clinics separate from general practice, you will not get very far. The biggest problem we have is actually with rural women. Spending $25 million over three years might provide a dozen centres, but it will do nothing for the rural women in Australia who suffer a higher rate of cervical cancer. - The other thing is it directly means that about $1,500 per year will be taken out of the pockets of every general practitioner in Australia - because of the Labor Party's decision to attempt a bureaucratic solution rather than a simple practical solution in exactly the same way that we were able to fix immunisation.  - The second thing I draw to the honourable member's attention in terms of recent comments is an article by Maxine McKew in the Bulletin of 12 June. In that, she was speculating on how the Labor Party might be able to fund the doctors' current $100,000 a year pay claim, and she says:There is an obvious option for the Labor Party. They can get their hands on close to $2bn by killing off the 30% rebate to those who take out private insurance.She goes on:It's no secret Macklin hates the rebate ... After a year or so into office, a defensible backflip could see the rebate scrapped with the revenues redirected to both public hospitals and GPs.It sounds like someone has been briefing journalists. We have had the shadow minister out there wandering around the gallery, with a wink and a nod -  - and the same to the backbench - saying, `We will knock off the 30 per cent rebate, even though we say that we will do it now.' They did it in 1975 and they did in 1984; they are not going to get a chance to do it in 2002.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. Of course, this government's policies have been to increase funding for education, and indeed our funding for schools is a rising proportion of GDP. But I am aware that the Leader of the Opposition has a list of 58 schools whose funding he plans to cut. He says that this hit list comprises the wealthiest schools in Australia, but when you look at the list there are some very strange features to it. The Leader of the Opposition's list does not include, for example, Melbourne Grammar, Wadhurst; Churchie, Brisbane; St Ignatius, Riverview; Queenwood; Pymble Ladies College; or Xavier College. None of these schools are on the list. He is not going to take any money away from these schools.He is not going to take a dollar away from PLC, Sydney; Riverview; Loretto, Kirribilli; or Melbourne Grammar, Wadhurst. And he is going to take away only $20 from SCEGGS Redlands and $101 from Ravenswood. He is targeting schools like Ivanhoe Girls Grammar in the electorate of Jagajaga. He is going to take $1,540 away from that school. He has discovered the secret haven of the super rich out there in the northern suburbs of Melbourne and he is going to target these wealthy schools. He is going to take $1,603 away from Woodley Junior School in the electorate of Dunkley, $1,909 away from Mentone Grammar in the electorate of Isaacs and $1,442 away from Caulfield Grammar in the electorate of Melbourne Ports.This list has no credibility whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition simply has not been prepared to do the work. If you are going to play the politics of envy, you might as well do it properly. You might as well try to actually find out what the wealthiest schools in Australia are and go for them. The AEU was demanding the policy - he had to come up with something - but, when you look at the 67 schools serving the wealthiest communities by the SES measure, only 23 of these are on Kim Beazley's list. So how did he get the list? He got the list by getting his office to go back to the old discredited ERI. As members of the House will remember, in August 1996, in a public report - the Leader of the Opposition could have consulted it; he could have actually used this report to compile his hit list - KPMG said: The ERI fails to meet most of the tests of an effective indicator of need.Yet this is precisely where the Leader of the Opposition - this policy weak, policy lazy Leader of the Opposition - went to get his list. It reminds me of Gilbert and Sullivan's words in The Mikado:As some day it may happen that a victim must be found,I've got a little list - I've got a little list ...He has turned himself into the Lord High Executioner of education policy. He is the Ko--Ko of education policy - Ko-Ko Kim. The Lord High Executioner. He has got his little list and, as Gilbert and Sullivan said, it does not much matter who is on the list, because the Australian Education Union was demanding a sacrificial list. It is no wonder that the 100,000 parents of the students of the schools which are on the Leader of the Opposition's list are getting very angry indeed. They see the gross injustice of this. This is not a list of the wealthiest schools; this is a list which signifies the policy laziness and incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition. It is this government that stands up for those middle income parents who are working hard to send their children through school. We are the ones who are standing up for those parents, and you want to go out there and attack them in a totally discriminatory and unjust way.</DOC>

 - Is this an endorsement by the Labor Party of the government policy of the training credit? Is that what it is? Are you announcing policy today? Because it would be the first time that the member for Dickson has. The course, as was pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, is being conducted tomorrow or on the weekend. There is in fact no training credit available at this point in time; it will be available later. That training credit will be available to the needy in this community, those mature aged workers and indigenous workers, for registered training which is going to assist them into work. I remind the member for Dickson that, when she was in the other place as a senator, she referred to the Labor Party policy as being caught in the spotlight and being unable to make any decisions in the area of employment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. She is a vigorous representative of small business in her electorate. The government will tomorrow introduce amendments to the Bankruptcy Act to crack down on people who try to hide behind the veil of bankruptcy to avoid paying their debts. Bankruptcy is there to help people who are overwhelmed with debts, but it is not a device to be used to deliberately defeat creditors with legitimate claims. The amendments will make it harder to become bankrupt and will make it harder to get out of bankruptcy once you are in it. - We will introduce a 30-day cooling-off period to make people think seriously about whether bankruptcy is the best option. We will encourage more people to consider debt agreements with their creditors to settle their debts. We will abolish early discharge provisions so that people cannot simply get into debt, claim bankruptcy, have the slate wiped clean after six months and then get back into racking up debts again. These measures will discourage people who would overspend on their credit cards or run up debts with small businesses and then use bankruptcy as a means of avoiding paying. They will help prevent people using bankruptcy to avoid sharing property -  - with a former partner in Family Court proceedings. They will target anyone who is abusing the bankruptcy process. The legislation itself is the product of two years of extensive consultation. We are responding to public concerns that bankruptcy is too easy a way out of avoiding obligations to creditors. Labor tried to introduce some reforms in 1995 but they did not succeed because they did not talk to anybody about them before they introduced them. One of my first initiatives, when the Howard government came in, was to establish a consultative forum on bankruptcy so that we could listen to the concerns of those involved in the personal insolvency industry and all who have an interest in bankruptcy. - The amendments that I will introduce tomorrow will continue the Howard government's commitment to better balancing the interests of creditors and of debtors. They follow our introduction in 1996 of the informal debt agreements, which encourage people to repay their debts rather than to go into bankruptcy. The member for McPherson asked about alternative policies. We have searched in vain for any Labor policy on the elimination of rorting in the bankruptcy system. In the absence of Labor having a policy of its own, I call on it to support the government with these amendments so that we can stamp out rorters and help creditors get the money they are entitled to.</DOC>

 - This is an extraordinary attack when the Leader of the Opposition stands here and condemns an organisation for providing quality training at a lower cost so that businesspeople can access that training -  - I make it quite clear to the Leader of the Opposition that I have not used my offices as a minister or as a member of parliament in any way which would detract from my duties as a minister. What I have done here is the same as when this gentleman offers courses to Lions and Rotary. Quite often, you will recommend it to the members -  - If you will be quiet, I will tell you. You will recommend it to the members of the association you are part of. I am part of the Liberal Party and I commend the training to them and they can therefore get it at a discounted price because, as I remind you, the gentleman provides his time, as he does for the Lions Club and the Rotary Club. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that Marc Ratcliffe - the gentleman who owns the organisation - conducts the training in his own time. He donates the time, hence the lower cost of the course.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. Mr Speaker, as you know only too well, it is often alleged by members opposite that big business or business generally has some sway over government policy. Let me state for the record that big business, and business generally, has no votes whatsoever in any coalition party room. Big business, or business generally, has no vote whatsoever in any coalition preselection.By contrast, under the notorious 60-40 rule, the union movement owns the Australian Labor Party lock, stock and barrel and critically determines Labor policy on nearly all issues. This occurs in big things such as the CFMEU recently wrecking the New South Wales government's workers compensation reform by threatening to withdraw half a million dollars in donation, and in small things such as the AWU putting a minder on the staff of the member for Dickson to try to make sure she does not breach Labor Party policy. Let me point out for the record that last year the union movement gave nearly $5 million to the Australian Labor Party, and union members were never consulted about this. Let me point out for the record -  - that under the Working Nation program when the member for Hotham was minister for employment, his department gave millions of dollars to the union movement in training grants, most of which were recycled to the ALP through union donations.Remarkably, the Queensland Labor Party has just changed its rules to ensure that unions get more votes for bigger donations. This is chequebook democracy ALP style, alive and well in the Queensland Labor Party. This is not about cleaning up the ALP. The ALP's real change is actually about the CFMEU prosecuting its historic fight against the AWU. Let me say to members opposite, in particular the CFMEU representative, the member for Brisbane, and the AWU representatives, the member for Rankin and the member for Griffith, that taking power off the AWU and giving it to the CFMEU is like taking power off Tammany Hall and giving it to the Mafia. That is what is happening inside the Queensland Labor Party. They are taking power off Tammany Hall to give it to the Mafia. Even people like John Sutton, the National Secretary of the CFMEU, are saying that organised crime has infiltrated his union, and this is a union which gives $400,000 a year to the ALP. There is only one way to clean up Australian politics, and it is not to take power from poor unions and give it to rich unions. As the member for Fremantle knows, the only way to clean up Australian politics is to break the union block vote inside the Australian Labor Party. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to impose a bit of internal democracy on his own party. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: Tony Blair had the guts to break the union block vote. Why doesn't the Leader of the Opposition?</DOC>

 - We will check that report but, even if that report were true, to suggest that there is a comparison -  - between payments of $103,000 and payments of $14 million is plainly ludicrous.  - Given that the Manager of Opposition Business has asked me some questions about the details of the financial arrangements, I will go back and, if there is any further information I should provide to the House, I will do that. The Australian public has seen, in relation to One.Tel, payment of two grossly excessive and totally unjustified bonuses totalling $14 million. I repeat: even if in a technical sense on all fours there is a comparison, to say that $14 million paid to two people is analogous to $103,000 paid to a number of people is plainly ludicrous.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. I know how strongly she defends the interests of everyday Australians in her electorate. Because of the introduction of the GST on 1 July last year, in just 24 days time financial institutions duty will be abolished in Australia. This is another tax cut delivered in full by the Howard government. This tax on bank deposits currently raises around $1.2 billion each year. It is charged at a rate of 6c for every $100 deposited at the bank. It is an insidious tax because it is a tax on savings and on mortgages and because it means more paperwork for Australian small businesses. Its abolition on 1 July represents a saving to every Australian man, woman and child of an average $63 a year. Add to this fact lower interest rates and significant reductions in income tax and the benefits of tax cuts start to become clear. It is crucial that this FID saving is passed on to consumers. Accordingly, I advise the House that the government is prescribing the abolition of FID under the Trade Practices Act so that consumers will have the benefit of full abolition of FID from 1 July. The protection provided by the ACCC will be the same protection provided during the introduction of the GST. There will be fines of up to $10 million for businesses and up to $500,000 for individuals who fail to pass the benefits of the abolition of FID straight through to consumers. This raises an interesting dilemma for the Leader of the Opposition which we on this side have come to call the Conroy dilemma, where the Leader of the Opposition has to explain how he is going to pay for roll-back and what taxes he is going to introduce. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to now declare that he will not reintroduce FID. Perhaps if I put on a schoolboy uniform he might give me an answer about whether he is going to reintroduce FID. - The abolition of FID is great for Australians and it is great for Australia.</DOC>

 - I will analyse what was in that article, and other matters, and when I have done that, if there is anything further I have to say, I will. I would like to make a couple of observations about the directors of National Textiles. It is well known in this place that the chairman of that company is my brother. I have never sought to hide that fact. He is a person of impeccable commercial and personal integrity, and I am immensely proud of the contribution he has made in a professional way and of my very close association with him. I think it is highly regrettable that, because he is my brother, his business affairs are traduced and trawled over in a quite disgraceful way by the Leader of the Opposition. - I might remind the Leader of the Opposition that all of the directors of that company were subject to an ASIC investigation, and the investigation said that there was no impropriety. You ought to have acknowledged that in your question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for a question of substance. - The Work for the Dole program continues to provide quality work experience for Australians. It is a program that is widely supported not only throughout the community but also by the participants. It is interesting to reflect upon the Hansard report of 1997, when Senator Faulkner had this to say: ... we do not, and we never will, buy the government's arguments that this program is about improving unemployed people's self-esteem and their work ethic. This is quite contrary to the view of 83 per cent of participants, who have said that they were more motivated to find a job as a result of their activities in Work for the Dole. It is interesting that we have had the New Zealand parliamentarians in here today. I am wondering whether they have been providing advice to the member for Dickson and the opposition, because they have just canned their equivalent of Work for the Dole and maybe this is something that the Labor Party are taking up. I say this because back in 1997 the Leader of the Opposition also referred to Work for the Dole as a `mickey mouse program'. So we know what they think about the program; what we do not know is whether they intend to maintain the program. In a recent conference in Adelaide on 17 May, the shadow spokesman, the member for Dickson, when referring to employment services said -  - You were not in Adelaide? You do not recall? You said that, if you had a bucket of money and a free hand to design a system of employment services, you would probably design it differently. The last time the Labor Party had a bucket of money was when they had a program called New Work Opportunities, which they like to refer to as being in some way their Work for the Dole. This is a program that cost $180,000 per net outcome - $180,000 for every person that got a job as a result of doing that program. That is what you do with a bucket of money if you are from the other side. It had a four per cent outcome. So 96 per cent of people who attended that training did not get a job and the Labor Party, and particularly the member for Dickson, say, `If I had a bucket of money, maybe I'd do it differently.' The question I ask is this: what does the Labor Party intend to do with the Job Network? What does the Labor Party intend to do with Work for the Dole? The fact is that there is not one thing on the web site of the Labor Party that refers to its policy direction in this area. The member for Herbert must ask the question: what is going to happen to the 42 participants who are operating with the Townsville Cycle Club providing wheelchair access, repairing grandstands and seating, and giving the clubhouse area a lift? What about the integrated disability support service project - the 35 participants there who are working in child care, as teachers aides, in reception or on admin duties? That is real work experience provided to real Australians across thousands of projects. What is the Labor Party's stand? What is it going to do? Is it going to support Work for the Dole?</DOC>

 - I am rather pleased that the Leader of the Opposition asked that question, because it illustrates that, if you fail with a fear campaign, I suppose you have got to turn to something else. What the Leader of the Opposition has done over the last three months is try and undermine the confidence of the Australian community, he has tried to talk down the Australian economy and he has trashed the national interest in the name of his own political interests. Having done that, he is now grabbing hold of this totally dishonest and false argument about savings. - I will give you some figures. Here we have a man who ran up, in his last five budgets, $96 billion of deficit. - How on earth can anybody who was a record builder of government debt claim respectability in relation to savings? It is a great example of the arsonist claiming respectability as a firefighter. The reality is that aggregate national savings in the Australian community are now higher than they were when the former government left office. What the Leader of the Opposition has done, in his typically dishonest and discriminate way, is grab hold of one narrow element of savings and extrapolate that to the whole economy. But when you actually analyse gross national savings - that is, in both the public and the private sectors - they have in fact risen from 18.2 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to 19.1 per cent of GDP in the March quarter of 2000. Why didn't the Leader of the Opposition say that last night? Why didn't the Leader of the Opposition say that when he asked his question? Indeed, why didn't the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say that when he was on the AM program this morning? If ever there were somebody on the run in relation to a logical answer, it was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the AM program. It is unbelievable for a person who was a senior minister in a government that left us with $96 billion - let me say that again: not $96 million, not $960,000 but $96 billion - of government debt to come into the House and say, `We are worried about savings.' He was not worried about savings when he ran the nation into debt when he was the finance minister; just as he was not worried about the national interest when he tried to talk the Australian economy into recession after the December quarter national accounts came down. This morning the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, `They have not only run down household savings; they have run down national savings.' That is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -  - I have got it here, mate: you have `run down national savings'. You go from 18.2 per cent to 19.1 per cent, and that is running down national savings! I suppose you would say that if you think it is acceptable to run up $96 billion of government debt and then proudly say, `Gee, we ran a good economy; we were concerned about savings; we were concerned about families.'Let me say something about families. Families today are enjoying the lowest interest rates for more than 30 years. Australian families are paying $300 on average a month less for their mortgage than they were paying in March 1996 and about $600 a month less than they were paying when your handiwork in government reached its peak - when interest rates went to 17 per cent. The three great legacies of Labor's last term in office were 17 per cent interest rates, $96 billion of government debt and almost 11 per cent unemployment when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. You tried to talk down the Australian economy and you trashed the national interest in the hope of gaining a short-term partisan political advantage. Now that you have been exposed, you are grabbing hold of some shonky dishonest argument about savings that is totally destroyed by any proper analysis of the figures.</DOC>

 - I have to say that the AM program really surpassed all of my expectations this morning. - It was an absolute corker. I am profoundly indebted to the ABC for running that program this morning. I am not always, as you know, an unconditional admirer of everything in news and current affairs at the ABC, but this morning they did the nation a service: they allowed the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to talk uninterrupted. We mined a very rich lode: not only did we get the latest version of Simon Crean on how to increase national savings by going into debt but also we got this extraordinary performance from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition complaining about government spending. That is not bad from a senior minister in a government that left us with $96 billion of government debt.We ought to analyse this. In the general what they say is, `The government's spending money,' but when you actually analyse what the government is spending money on you do not hear the Labor Party say, `We wouldn't have done that; we'd spend the money on something else.' No, indeed. What you actually hear in relation to many of these things is the Labor Party saying, `They should have spent more.' You have got an enormous problem when you are a political opportunist, because what happens is that you keep bumping into the argument you used yesterday. That basically is what happened to the member for Hotham this morning. He said, `They have been spending all of this money.' Let me just go through some of the things that they have been spending money on and in relation to each item let us find out whether they are in favour of it or against it - a simple yes or no. I think the Australian people want their politics straight, don't they? Let us see.Government members - Yes! - Righto. Let us start with local roads. One of the things that we are spending is $1.6 million on roads. Is the opposition in favour of that - yes or no? -  - Come on: let's hear from him. In December the government announced a plan to increase defence spending. I suppose that is irresponsible, is it? Is the opposition in favour of that - yes or no? -  - A cacophony of opportunism! - Yes and no - plus a couple of free submarines into the bargain! Then we have the Natural Heritage Trust, an injection of $1 billion over five years - yes or no? - Pork-barrelling, is it? Oh, shocking! And I suppose, when you fly over all of the salinity problems when flying from Perth to Canberra, you think tackling Australia's salinity problems is pork-barrelling. If the people of Western Australia knew that the Leader of the Opposition opposes spending money fixing the salinity problem, they would not think he was representing the interests of the state in which he was born. - Western Australia has a enormous salinity problem -  - and it has taken a coalition government -  - I would move on to the role of science and technology in the Australian community. We have heard a lot from the opposition about science and technology, we have heard a lot from the opposition in relation to innovation; and we have actually heard the opposition saying that we ought to spend more money, not less. That is what they have been saying. When I brought out Backing Australia's Ability in January, the response of the opposition was that we should be spending more. So I would say to those opposite: if they presume to criticise the $3 billion that we committed in the Backing Australia's Ability program to expenditure on innovation and on science and technology, if they are saying that that is a spending spree, let them go out to the scientists of Australia and say where they are going to cut our committed expenditure on science. The day of accounting has got to come. You cannot have it both ways: you cannot run around in general and say, `Oh, this is outrageous, they are spending money,' and then go to the particular community in a narrowcasting way and say, `Oh, look, vote for us and we'll spend a lot more.' You cannot get away with that. You have got to be consistent. The reality is that we have committed in this budget additional expenditure on roads, on defence, on the environment, on salinity and on science and technology. Another one is the $600 million over four years in fighting foot-and-mouth disease. Is the Labor Party opposed to that? Do you want to put our rural industries at risk by winding that money back? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition shakes his head. The Leader of the Opposition will now rise on a point of order. Are you going to come clean and tell the Australian public exactly where you stand? - This budget commits $600 million over a period of four years to fight foot-and-mouth disease. Apparently, that is part of the spending splurge that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was attacking this morning. It also commits $900 million to high priority health initiatives, including the prevention and management of diabetes, asthma and cervical cancer. Presumably, that is part of the spending splurge that the government is irresponsibly embarked upon! We have been able to commit additional resources to these areas of high national priority that have the unconditional and indisputable support of the great bulk of the Australian community because we have got Australia's economic house in order. There is a vast difference between spending money by going into deficit and spending money while still remaining in surplus. I know that the concept of spending money and maintaining a balanced budget is beyond the comprehension of the Leader of the Opposition, because when he was finance minister he certainly did not practice that art; in fact, he ran up deficits that contributed to the $96 billion of government debt we inherited in March 1996. We have committed the resources of the budget of the Commonwealth to high priority things which are important to all of the Australian people. Every last dollar of the expenditure I have mentioned in this answer is necessary and in the long-term interests of the Australian community. Those who argue that that is irresponsible have the obligation to tell the Australian people which areas that they will cut.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I would say a number of things. Firstly, I would like him to send me a copy of the email. I will then write to this person and say a number of things in that answer. I will remind this person of what interest rates were like when you mob were last in office, I will remind this person of the company tax rate under this government - I do not know whether this gentleman's or lady's business operates as a sole trading enterprise or as a corporation; if it operates as a corporation, then its company tax rate will have fallen from 36 cents to 30 cents in the dollar under this government - I will remind this person of benefits that are available to many small businesses, not all of them in Queensland because not all of the financial institution duties apply in Queensland; and I will remind this person, if he happens to operate as a sole trader and not as a corporation, that he has the advantage of a halving effectively of the capital gains tax. I will point out to him that the March quarter accounts showed a rise of two per cent in the profit margins of small operations in Australia. If he has a work force of any consequence, I will remind him that, under this government, industrial relations have been made simpler and easier and that there is far greater flexibility at the workplace. I will point out that, if the experience of his staff has been the same as the generality of Australian workers, those staff have enjoyed significant rises in their real incomes and are in fact, in common with other wage and salary earners who are buying a home, increasingly better off because of our lower interest rates.As to the individual circumstances of a particular business, naturally I am in no position to make a judgment about the individual circumstances of the 900,000 to a million small businesses in Australia. I can make judgments about the generality of the circumstances. They are living in a lower interest rate environment, they are living in a lower tax environment, they are living in a better industrial relations environment and they are living in an environment of rising consumer confidence, despite the worst attempts of the opposition to talk the economy down. And the last thing I would say as I reply to this person is, `If you want to experience a lift in your confidence and spirits, don't write to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I think I can say to him that practically everybody who commented on yesterday's national accounts welcomed the fact that the Australian economy grew at 1.1 per cent in the March quarter. As far as I am aware, the only people who were disappointed yesterday were spokesmen for the Australian Labor Party. Even the ACTU welcomed yesterday's growth figures, but the Labor Party first of all went AWOL when the member for Hotham could not bring himself to go on the World Today and then spent the next 24 hours trying to find some dark side to the national accounts and went on the ABC this morning and  made the totally false claim that national savings had been run down. He said on AM this morning that national savings had been run down. It was totally false. The opposition have been unable to welcome good news for the Australian economy because they have decided that it is in their political interests to have bad news for the Australian economy. Shame on them! They would put their own party-partisan political interests in front of the true welfare of the people of Australia. The true welfare of the people of Australia lies in a strong economy with a good tax system. This is consistent with a group of opportunists who make mutually inconsistent claims when they think it suits them. Let us have a look at some of the claims they have now made in relation to the economy and the tax system. On 2 August 2000 the Leader of the Opposition said this:These interest rate rises ... have one set of vital origins - GST.That is what he said on 2 August. On 8 February 2001 he said:... these interest rate cuts are a direct result of the government's GST.So on 2 August 2000 GST was causing an interest rate rise, and on 8 February 2001 GST was causing an interest rate cut. On 3 February 2000 he said that the tax package: ... runs the risk of refuelling consumption and overheating the economy.But on 7 March he said:The GST did not mug the economy; it king hit it.So on 3 February 2000 it is refuelling and overheating; by 7 March, it is mugging and king hitting. Which one is it? - `Both,' he says. It puts up interest rates and it brings them down, it overheats and then it king hits. On 14 March he goes at it irresponsibly and says:This is an Australian home grown recession.That is totally false, totally irresponsible and totally partisan. The next day he came out - listen to this - and said:I've now shifted my position to: I hope there won't be a recession.Every time you think you have heard the biggest opportunist in Australian politics, along comes the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In one of those classic interviews on the ABC this morning about the GST - we are now in the mode where the GST has mugged the economy, notwithstanding a 1.1 per cent increase in the March quarter - he was asked this:There's been a big jump in services growth. You're in a sector that had no indirect taxes before but which now has a 10 per cent GST - wouldn't you expect to see a sign there if it was mugging the economy?'He said this:Don't you think that if people are forced to pay 10 per cent more to the government that growth should happen? I mean, a sector that had no tax in it and people having to pay 10 per cent additional on everything, you'd expect it to grow, wouldn't you?' No, your answer is that you would expect it to fall, actually. Your position is that, if you have mugged it with a 10 per cent tax, you would expect it to fall. But, of course, when it actually grows, you would expect it to grow - that is, unless it was falling. You would expect it to put up interest rates - that is, unless it put them down again. You would expect it to overheat the economy - that is, unless it king-hit it. This is an opposition which is wandering around the political landscape, which has no position on anything, relying on a soft press not to pick up its position. But at the end of the day it knows not where it is going - it does not have the wit or the policy to take a position on anything.</DOC>

 - I think comparison of unemployment figures is always useful in the context of the Australian political debate. If my memory serves me correctly, when this government came to office unemployment was running at a rate of 8.7 per cent. It had peaked just under 11 per cent on the new measure - 11.2 per cent on the old measure - under the stewardship of you know who, who was in charge of things then. I am very proud of the fact, can I say to the member for Dickson, that under this government more than 800,000 new jobs have been created. There are 800,000 more jobs in the Australian economy as a result of the policies of this government. We have also seen significant falls in the rate of youth unemployment, and we have seen very significant improvements in the position of the long-term unemployed. We have also seen the introduction of a number of programs, particularly through Work for the Dole, which has been very successful.I interpolate here that I read in the press this morning that the New Zealand Labour government has decided to abandon work for the dole. I am not surprised to read that because when Labor governments get into office, no matter what they have said about work for the dole when they were in opposition, when they get their hands on the levers of government, they decide to abandon it.Unemployment remains too high in this country. I would never argue that the job in relation to employment is ever done. The reality is, though, that unemployment now is significantly lower than it was when this government came to office, and nothing that the member for Dickson can say alters that unassailable fact.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he is seeing the benefit of many of those very projects that are being funded under Roads to Recovery in his own electorate. This program was announced in November last year. It is an additional $1.2 billion for local roads, around $850 million of which will be spent in the regions. It underscores, of course, a very deep commitment by the Liberal-National government to rural and regional areas.I noted that the PM made the comment that there were three essential hallmarks of the ALP's abysmal performance in government: $96 billion worth of public sector debt, record interest rates and 11 per cent unemployment. They came together in a way which led to a fourth hallmark, and that was dying regions, dying regions with a real shortage of basic services, the loss of mobile phone coverage, a shortage of doctors - GPs and specialists - and nurses, and collapsing road infrastructure. We are seriously addressing those problems.One of the things I want to draw to the attention of the House with this very successful program is the flexibility of the program. In March I announced that the government would speed up Roads to Recovery payments to local governments wanting to get on with projects that involved large up-front costs. Today I am delighted to announce that I have approved a second round of accelerated payments totalling $46 million to assist 98 councils across Australia to complete important road projects as quickly as possible. They range from the sealing of dangerously inadequate dirt roads right through to kerbing and guttering in flood prone regions. In fact, there are now 3,000 projects up and running under this program across Australia, involving 480 councils. This is a program that the Leader of the Opposition initially described as a boondoggle. They then decided that it was not worth continuing. They have now got to the point where we do not know where they stand on it but, worse than that, we do not know where the states stand on it either. Far from increasing their funding for local and regional roads to dovetail with what we are doing, to really accelerate this important infrastructure program across Australia, we now find that in Queensland, despite the Prime Minister writing to each of the state premiers urging them to commit themselves to this program and to not undercut it by reducing their own expenditure, the Queensland minister will not make that same commitment. Not only do we have the federal Labor Party refusing to commit to this valuable program but we have the states refusing to increase expenditure. The state Labor Party in Victoria I think spends $14 million or $15 million a year - it is in that sort of bracket; that is the level of their commitment. While we put in $1.2 billion, they spend around $14 million or $15 million - no increase. In Queensland, we have a refusal to commit to maintaining the program.While I am on that, there was an earlier question about a small businessman in Cairns. I just happened to be in Cairns recently. I know the Prime Minister would welcome me adding to some comments he made. The basis of the economy up there is sugar, bananas and tourism. All of those three industries face real challenges. It is not the Labor government in Queensland that is helping them address those challenges, it is not members oppose - it is us. Regarding tourism, we have been working with Warren Entsch and a task force to try and get more international tourists in through Cairns airport. Regarding bananas, my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is working to help them cope with black sigatoka, a very serious threat to that industry. Regarding sugar, we have the work of the sugar task force and we have the sugar package securing the future of that industry. - It reflects again our commitment to rural and regional Australia, which is simply not matched in rhetoric, let alone in action, by the ALP.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can inform the House that as part of taxation reform Australian charities, such as schools, church groups, welfare organisations and registered charities are entitled to refunds of any excess imputation credits on any share or trust dividends they receive. There would be many charitable trusts that have investments in shares and those shares pay franked dividends. Those charitable trusts are not subject to tax, so where franked dividends are paid they have not been able to use the tax paid - they have no tax liability to set it off against - and, as a consequence, have borne a taxation liability for which they were not liable. The government has introduced the refunding of excess imputation credits so that those charities which do not have a tax liability can claim back the full amount of the tax on franked dividends. It is expected that this will deliver an additional $50 million to the charities of Australia in tax reductions. The Australian Taxation Office is sending out kits now to 42,000 organisations that may be eligible to claim these refunds on imputation credits. To apply for the refunds, they need to complete a form in the kit that is being mailed out, rather than filing a tax return. Of course the refunding of excess imputation credits is not just available to charities and tax exempts; it is also available to taxpayers.In the past there have been numbers of people on low tax rates, particularly pensioners, who may have some Telstra shares or Commonwealth Bank shares which pay franked dividends and were paying them at 36 per cent, even though those taxpayers did not have a marginal rate of 36 per cent - they might have only been on 20 per cent, and so they were paying 16 per cent more tax on those dividends than they needed to. As a result of this government's reforms, they can now claim back the excess imputation credits: they do not have to pay on those dividends a higher tax rate than their personal tax liability. It means for older Australians and pensioners that the value of their dividends and their investments is increased. That is just one of the things that was done as part of tax reform. It was never introduced previously; it was never available under any other government. It of course is being funded by the new taxation arrangements. And we ought to ask the question: if the Labor Party is going to roll back the revenue base and increase spending and run bigger surpluses, what is the future with tax benefits like these? Every tax benefit like these is at risk.The reason why the Labor Party of course will not come clean on their roll-back policy is that they do not want to tell the public of Australia which taxes they are going to put up to pay for it. In fact, we had an extraordinary situation at the National Press Club about a week ago when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that he was going to set up a committee to advise him on roll-back after the election - after the election! They have been going on about roll-back for - what is it? - four years, I think. They still cannot announce any of it. And now he wants the chance to announce it after the election. Well, come clean with the people of Australia. Stop running away. Be honest and have the courage to put your policies out to the public so they can assess them.</DOC>

 - The honourable member may not be aware, but there is a review, entitled the Nunn review, into military remuneration, which includes superannuation entitlements. That review, under General Nunn, will be reporting by the middle of August. We thought it was appropriate, as remuneration for Defence Force personnel includes retirement benefits, that it would be considered as part of that review. We expect to have that review in our hands by the end of August. That is the appropriate course. Let me also say that those who are on retirement benefits as former members of the Australian Defence Force will in fact have those retirement benefits increased by six per cent on 1 July this year. So let us not have any of this misleading humbug coming from the other side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I am sure the members on this side of the House will be pleased to know that the latest ABS figures show that full-time employment, part-time employment and the participation rates are all at near record levels. Today's figures show that trend employment, at 9,149,000, is at an all-time high. What they suggest is that this government's changes to workplace relations and to employment services mean that, at any given level of economic activity, the unemployment level is now significantly lower than it has been in the recent past. This is very good news for Australia, but it is very bad news for the Australian Labor Party, which is constantly finding fault with our country. Unemployment can never go too high for the economic vultures on the other side of the House. For months they have been trying to psych Australia into a recession, and it just has not worked. But what they have shown over the last few months in what they have said about the Australian economy is that they are guilty of little short of economic treason against Australia.I am pleased to say that youth unemployment, at just 5.2 per cent of the teenage population, is now one-third lower than its peak, when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. - One of the reasons why youth employment is strong is that this government has successfully passed youth wages legislation. Let me give credit where it is due. That legislation was passed with the support of the member for Brisbane. - It was one of the very rare acts of statesmanship from this opposition. - The Labor Party have been gunning for the member for Brisbane -  - ever since.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. What a great program it was. The Federation Fund has created jobs and conferred lasting benefits of a very concrete kind on communities across the nation. - It was an integral part of a legacy from the Centenary of Federation for generations to come, and it is a program and fund that should be supported by all members of the House. I know that my electorate has benefited from it, as have a large number of Labor Party electorates - so much so that the Auditor-General has examined the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects program and has found that it was fairly, equally and in a balanced way administered and that the coalition held 63.5 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives at the time of its distribution and were allocated 61.7 per cent of the projects - below our representation, Labor held 33.1 per cent of the seats and was allocated 31.7 per cent of projects, and the Independents held 3.4 per cent of the seats and were allocated 6.6 per cent of projects. - What we have found is that this fund in its different aspects has created jobs, developed infrastructure and stimulated economic activity, particularly in rural and regional Australia. In regard to the alleged comments of the member for Farrer associated with the publication and promotion of his excellent biography, they have been taken somewhat out of context, as I am sure he would be the first to say. It is gripping reading -  - You are reading it and you have found it to be interesting. You are learning a lot about how government operates and how distinguished a career he has had in the parliament. There is no doubt whatsoever that the Federation Fund was of great benefit to all Australians, wherever they lived, whoever represented them. </DOC>

 - Obviously, the future of rural and regional Australia is very much dependent upon having an effective range of well-equipped and skilled young people to provide leadership roles. That is vital for country communities and it is vital for rural industries. It is certainly important that we build on the skills and the talents of the many very able young people who live and work in country Australia. This government has announced a range of initiatives to assist young people in agriculture, particularly those in the age range from about 18 to 35 who have chosen to take up a career in agriculture or the fisheries and forestry industries. Amongst the initiatives that the government will be funding are a number of leadership training courses. I am pleased to inform the House that we have present in the gallery today the 40 members of the first rural young leaders training course. Honourable members - Hear, hear! - They include Leanne Kelly from the honourable member's electorate, Michael Duff from my own electorate and, indeed, representatives from many of the regional -  - I am sorry, Prime Minister, it is not a rural electorate, so there is not anybody from your electorate, but I would be more than delighted to choose somebody from your electorate to participate in a program of this nature. These are the people who, as a result of the leadership training course that they are participating in this week and other initiatives involved in this program, will be leading the farm organisations of Australia in the future. Many of them may be occupying seats in this chamber, coming down from the gallery and playing a leadership role also in government. We wish them well in this course. That is only a part of the program. There will also be opportunities to participate in director training courses, to be involved with the young people as clients strategy and grants to youth organisations and to participate in study programs - all key elements in developing the skills available in rural and regional Australia.This is one of the initiatives that is included in the Agriculture Advancing Australia program - an $830 million initiative funded by this government and one which is already playing a very important role in rural and regional Australia. When you look around at Labor leaders and deputy leaders complaining about government expenditure, you have to actually ask this question: will this program survive a Labor government? We know it is very hard indeed to find any Labor government at state or federal level in history that has not slashed programs in rural and regional Australia.Yesterday we had the opposition spokesman for agriculture, who is not even present in the chamber at the moment, making his response to the budget speech. He did not even mention agriculture in his entire speech - no policy, no indications of expenditure initiatives. We have to indeed be concerned about what is going to happen in relation to rural expenditure should Labor ever be in government. Vital programs like encouraging young people in rural industries are certainly at risk if Labor were ever to come into office. The coalition is committed to helping young people in rural areas. We are doing something about it, and of course Labor have never done anything about it when they have had the opportunity.</DOC>

 - My answer before was entirely relevant because the Nunn review is reviewing Defence Force remuneration, which includes superannuation. Unfortunately it is a little bit hard for the opposition member to understand that, when you look at Defence Force remuneration, it includes superannuation retirement benefits. Apparently he just does not understand that. - The retirement benefits for members who have retired from the Defence Force are all part of the Nunn review. If, given what the Treasurer announced in the budget papers on budget night in relation to CPI increases that will apply to the Public Service, the opposition is suggesting that members of the Defence Force are public servants in uniform and should have been linked to that same announcement, that is something that this side of the House rejects. Our Defence Force personnel are very special people and that is why we are, through the Nunn review, looking at their remuneration and their retirement benefits. I repeat for the benefit of the opposition that on 1 July this year, 2001, those who have retired and are drawing superannuation benefits will get the normal CPI increase which was due to them, which is six per cent. Let us not have any more of this humbug from the other side of the House, and I hope that the opposition spokesman on these affairs can do better in terms of policy development than he did at the Labor conference in Hobart last year -  - when he was seen and photographed outside the conference -  - contemplating -  - Defence Force retirement benefits policy. Mr Speaker, that is the opposition! - Mr Speaker, we expect to have the Nunn review details before us by the end of August, and at that time the government will be considering the appropriate way that we address retirement benefits and Defence Force remuneration.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. Obviously, she is a great supporter of the Job Network and operations like Gemcell Pty Ltd and Shoalhaven Employment, operating out of Moss Vale, Nowra and Ulladulla. Of course, she has concerns about what might happen to those operations should we ever be unfortunate enough to have a Labor government and she asked am I aware of any comments in recent times which would bring into question the whole issue of regional services, in particular for Job Network. It is one of the significant pluses of this government that we have actually put 1,100 separate Job Network operations into regional and rural Australia when under the Labor Party there was a total of 300 CESs throughout the whole of Australia. So I was very interested to see comments by the member for Dickson down in Melbourne on 17 May -   - Yes, not Adelaide; it is in Melbourne that you made the comments, but the quotes are accurate. The member for Dickson, the shadow spokesman, says:I question whether the government's boast about the increased number of Job Network sites is valid. In places like Kingaroy - the member for Blair might be interested - the number of providers actually made very little difference. I think we can question a bald assertion that an increased number of sites automatically means increased prospects for job seekers.Now this raised the interest of some of those there, so she was asked a question. A fellow actually from Ballarat - from the chief whip's electorate - Mr Stone, asked her a question as to what she actually meant by this. It was really quite interesting. After the gobbledegook she got through, she had this to say:... when you are assessing bids in terms of sites, I don't think you take as your number one criterion pure number and geographical spread. Not geographical spread. She continues: It doesn't seem to have this problem in urban areas, but in some regional areas I don't think you should say that the competitive model is the only way to go. I'd probably make a distinction between regional coverage and urban coverage.She says that there is too much competition in Kingaroy, so I ask her: which of the Job Network members, which of the small businesses, in Kingaroy do you intend to close down? Do you intend to close down the South Burnett Community Trading Centre? Or perhaps you intend to close down the Gympie Skillcentre Inc., operating in Kingaroy, because there are too many small businesses there?The question asked whether or not there is anything else to support this. The Leader of the Opposition says that there is too much fat in employment services. So where do you intend to cut the fat from? Perhaps you intend to cut the fat from the electorate of Bass? Maybe in a regional area like Bass you would like to get rid of Job Net Tasmania Inc. in Mowbray? The member for Northern Territory is still in the chamber. Maybe in the Northern Territory Alice Springs does not need the Industry Association Network, or perhaps a regional community like Katherine really does not need the services of another small business like the Industry Education Network. I was going to bring up the electorate of the member for Paterson, but of course he is not here. Oh! He's back! The member for Paterson is back. You have put the dummy back in, have you? - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. It is just good to see him back. Member for Paterson, are you going to take up with the member for Dickson her plan to get rid of the new Hunter business operation at Anna Bay, or are you going to take up with her that she is going to get rid of small businesses operating employment services in Maitland? Those are the questions you should be asking the member for Dickson. - I appreciate that, Mr Speaker. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition had a fantastic record as the minister for employment services. He was at the top of the pile! He was 11.2 per cent, he had 1 million unemployed. With the unemployment figures having come out, today we have at the top of the pile a Labor premier in Peter Beattie at nine per cent - the worst unemployment level in the whole of Australia. And what does the Leader of the Opposition say? He says, `I set Peter Beattie as my benchmark.' Nine per cent unemployment: if that is your benchmark, the best you did as employment minister was 11.2 per cent, old son - not very good. </DOC>

 - I really thank the Leader of the Opposition for the opportunity to answer the question. I have spoken to Marc Ratcliffe, the promoter of this particular training course, today and he informs me that he is not conducting the course at $350, because none of the 50 people that received the brochure that was distributed actually took up that offer.  -  - I think 12 people - keep laughing - are doing the course at somewhere of the order of $600, as part of his business. Not one cent of that money is going to the Liberal Party, and he has told them that. However, this coming weekend he will provide another quality course. I believe about seven individuals are taking that course at $350, and every one of them knows that he is making a contribution to the Liberal Party. - It raises an interesting question. The whole attack on me is because I did not have `Liberal Party' on the promotion of an activity that I undertook in my electorate. There was another assertion today in a newspaper that Sarino Russo, who is a Job Network member, held a fundraiser for me in the same sort of line and that I had somehow misled people. Can I just explain to people -  - The point I would like to make is that the Labor Party has made a concerted attack on me during the week regarding the fact that I have somehow misled people. I have here in front of me an invitation which reads:Sarino Russo would like to extend a special invitation for you to attend a briefing with the Hon. Kim Beazley MP, Leader of the Opposition, and Ms Cheryl Kernot MP, Member for Dickson, Queensland.  Date: 15 MayTime: 7 p.m. for 7.30 p.m. - `So what?' I hear him say. It continues:Venue: Cabinet Room - the closest you are going to get to a cabinet room - Conrad International Hotel - Mr Speaker, it continues:Tickets: $500 per personPlease make your cheques payable to Dickson MPENo reference to the Labor Party: how tricky is that?</DOC>

 - I can confirm to the member for Gray, and indeed to the House, that yesterday at the Sydney Mail Exchange Australian quarantine inspection officers intercepted a package containing six snakes and two lizards in a parcel from the United Kingdom as it underwent X-ray examination. This package was declared as a baby gift valued at £19 sterling. But, had these snakes been carrying any pests or diseases, the real cost to Australia and Australia's environment would have been very great indeed. The package included two East African sand boas, two ball pythons and two deadly spine-tailed dragon lizards. Unfortunately, only one of them was still alive, so the cruelty involved in this process surely is also a matter of concern to the House. I am told that technically they may have been worth several thousands of dollars, but the reality is that the potential cost to Australia's disease-free status could have been infinitely more.I am pleased to report that the X-ray machine which discovered this misnamed package was a part of the federal government's new $600 million expansion for quarantine services. It is an X-ray machine that has been installed in the mail exchange so that we can keep better tabs on the sorts of things coming through the mail system. - This is a classic example of how packages are often misnamed. The reality is that, under the previous government, quarantine had been allowed to run down; the number of people at the border had been significantly reduced. It is interesting to note that, under Labor, there were only 10 quarantine officers in all of the mail exchanges and no X-ray machines. Under this strategy that the government has funded in this year's budget, there will be 110 quarantine staff and new mail exchanges built so that we can achieve a 100 per cent inspection of all the mail coming into Australia. That is important, because the incident I refer to is not the only one. In fact, it is happening all the time. Just in the last few days, AQIS screening at the Qantas mail handling unit in Sydney detected one kilogram of compost material from the Netherlands, suitable for growing mushrooms. There was 1.5 kilograms of salami from France that was misdeclared as books; dog food from the UK declared as make-up; and prohibited meat and cheese, which was seized at the Clyde mail centre, labelled `T-shirts and crayons'.Under Labor, that advice would largely have been accepted without any proper testing and checking. Now there will be 110 quarantine officers, plus X-ray machines and dog teams, to make sure these products do not get through our borders. Of course, the whole $600 million is at risk because Labor considers the government is spending too much money. They want to slash these sorts of expenditure. Only under this government can the Australian public rely on getting an effective screening and the building again of our defences at the quarantine borders. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. In 1996, the coalition promised to replace Labor's demoralising roundabout of short-term training programs with quality training leading on to real jobs - and we have delivered on that. The last five years have seen a massive expansion in quality training opportunities for young people, especially for the 70 per cent of young people who leave school and do not go straight on to university. When the Leader of the Opposition was training minister, apprenticeships declined by 20,000 in one year, while unemployment soared. And he did nothing. He let the union bosses devastate the apprenticeship system. He told his biographer at the time that he was not interested. He said:... I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining ... I thought that there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than in just about any I have had.He simply was not interested. He surrendered the apprenticeship system to the trade union bosses and the apprenticeship system was devastated. The Howard government has more than doubled apprenticeship opportunities. There are now over 300,000 young people in apprenticeships and traineeships in Australia for the first time in Australian history - 303,000 new apprentices in training at the end of March - far more than double the 135,000 of Labor's last year. Indeed, almost half of all the teenagers in training in employment in Australia at the moment are in a new apprenticeship, and 90 per cent of those young people go from their new apprenticeship into employment.If you put Labor in charge of training, opportunities decline. For Labor, power to the unions is much more important than training young people. When the Beattie government came to office we saw a collapse in training opportunities in Queensland. In fact, there are still fewer new apprentices in Queensland than there were in 1998 when the Beattie government came to office. The Carr government has actually provided fewer new apprenticeships than are available in Victoria, even though New South Wales is a much larger state. And the Bracks government has capped the number of apprenticeship opportunities.Tomorrow is the day of reckoning for the state Labor governments, because in the recent budget we put some $230 million down on the table to add an extra 20,000 new apprenticeships and so far the Labor states have failed to say that they will match the Commonwealth's contribution. They need to match that contribution. So far, we have had governments like that in New South Wales taking money out of training - actually reducing the contribution to training. That is the pathetic training performance of the Carr government. Tomorrow we will see where the state Labor governments stand. But we know the great flaw in Labor's attitude to training: its main agenda is to hand the training system back to the trade unions and deprive young Australians of training opportunities. It is this government which is prepared to invest in training, and I will be saying to the Labor Party tomorrow, `Show me the money.' </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. Can I say that the government, in this case through my department, did carefully examine the appointment of the Sri Lankan High Commissioner, as we examine the appointment of all ambassadors and high commissioners to Australia. In this particular case, these considerations have not established any basis from which the Australian government could challenge the Sri Lankan government's advice that the high commissioner is a worthy and suitable appointment. I myself did speak to the Sri Lankan Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Kadirgamar, about this some time ago - I do not have the date with me but it was quite some weeks ago now - from my home. We had a discussion about the appointment of General Perera, and the foreign minister made it clear to me, as we have said on a number of occasions, that he regarded the general as a worthy and suitable appointment.We have been made aware of claims, and we have sought to indicate that the circumstances of the high commissioner's military service meant that he was likely to have served in areas where human rights abuses were alleged to have occurred, but none of these claims, my department advises me, has been backed by any direct evidence of his involvement. I understand that the high commissioner has endeavoured to correct what he believes to be errors of fact. As a senior commander in the Sri Lankan army, Major General Perera's nomination was bound to attract some criticism from those on the other side of the conflict in Sri Lanka. I note that I have received representations from the Sri Lankan community in Australia, both supporting very strongly as well as opposing very strongly the appointment of General Perera.Australia does take its human rights responsibilities very seriously and we have actively sought to promote respect for human rights in Sri Lanka, including during my visit there some time ago. We have constant dialogue with the Sri Lankan government at different levels. It is most unusual in the extreme for the Australian government to reject the nomination of a high commissioner or an ambassador. These appointments are made at the end of the day - although the government does have the prerogative to reject them - by the relevant government, not by the Australian government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for that question. I am pleased to inform the House that I have today announced that I will recommend to the Governor-General the appointment of Mr Justice Neville Owen of the Western Australian Supreme Court to head the royal commission into the failure of HIH. Justice Owen is eminently qualified to undertake this task. He has a special interest in commercial litigation and corporate insolvency. The proposed terms of reference I am sending to the premiers with a request that they clothe the royal commission with all the necessary powers to enable a full investigation of state instrumentalities as well as federal ones, and I have no doubt that, given their expressions of concern about this matter, the state premiers will immediately respond in a positive way to that request. I will of course also be recommending to His Excellency the Governor-General the approval of those terms of reference.The announcements of these arrangements relating to the royal commission build on the government's earlier decision to establish a relief scheme for certain policyholders suffering financial hardship as a result of the HIH collapse. I want to thank the Western Australian Chief Justice for agreeing to make Mr Justice Owen available and also record the cooperation of the Western Australian government. It is not always easy to get people of very high calibre to undertake these tasks. The judge is warmly regarded in legal and community circles in Western Australia. He is a very experienced judicial officer. He will do a very good and conscientious job. His appointment is an earnest of the government's determination to get to the bottom of what happened with HIH, and I am sure it will be widely supported by both sides of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I can inform him that the Westpac Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment, released last Wednesday, showed that consumer sentiment rose by 14.8 per cent in June as against May. This is the largest increase in consumer sentiment in 25 years. The consumers' assessment of the economy over the next 12 months rose by 32.9 per cent. They are optimistic about the long-term outlook for the economy, with the index for this question rising to its highest level since 1994. There was a strong rise in optimism that now is a good time to buy major household items. The good thing about the consumer sentiment rise in June is that not only has it come off the back of strong national accounts for March but it puts an end to the incredibly negative sentiment reflected through the media during the first quarter of this year, talked up by the Australian Labor Party and championed of course by Dun and Bradstreet, which predicted that Australia would go through three quarters of negative growth, notwithstanding the fact that, in the March quarter, growth in the Australian economy was 1.1 per cent. Australians will welcome the fact that consumer sentiment has picked up. It will be good for retailers and it will be good for the Australian economy.This of course may not be warmly welcomed by the Labor Party, which has been doing its best to talk down consumer sentiment. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that the week before last the Leader of the Opposition decided to go to Aston, in breathless anticipation of bad March quarter national accounts, and, as I said at the time he was in Aston, he was a'wishin' an' a'hopin' an' a'thinkin an' a'prayin' that we would be getting some bad national accounts. But there was good news for the Australian economy with those national accounts.The other extraordinary comment he made while he was in Aston was, `Asia is fine, the US is fine and Europe is fine' - the implication being that Australia was somehow the odd man out in a buoyant world economy. Well, every other economist in the world may beg to differ with the Leader of the Opposition. He no doubt will say that he is the only one who has it right. When he made the statement that the US is fine and Asia is fine, I could hear the collective clunk as jaws hit keypads in dealing rooms on their foreign currency exchanges.Just for the sake of the record, the US economy March accounts showed that growth was 0.3 per cent for the March quarter. The US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 250 basis points. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve said on 24 May 2001:This period of sub-par economic growth is not yet over and we are not free of the risk that economic weakness will be greater than currently anticipated ...No doubt, the chairman of the Fed has got it wrong. He is aggressively cutting interest rates by 250 basis points, expecting sub-par economic growth, just at the time when the Leader of the Opposition proclaims that the US economy is strong. He is the only person in the world who currently believes that the US economy is strong.The other prediction he made was: `Asia is fine.' For the sake of the record, lest people believe his prognostications, let me go through it: in the March quarter, the Philippines had negative growth of 0.5 per cent, Thailand had negative growth of 0.2 per cent, Taiwan had negative growth of 0.4 per cent and Singapore had negative growth of three per cent. If that is an Asia that is fine, one would hate to see an Asia that was going through a downturn. The Japanese economy in the March quarter had a downturn of 0.2 per cent, with the possibility recently identified by the finance minister of Japan of Japan going back into recession.I mention all of this to show that the Leader of the Opposition has no understanding of any economy, either his own or any foreign economy. I say that because the world is currently going through a downturn not just in relation to the United States but in relation to Asia and to Europe as well. The fact that the world is going through a downturn will affect Australia. Notwithstanding that we had strong March accounts, that will affect Australia in the coming quarters.What do you do in a period of world weakness? You do everything you can to help your exports. One of the things that this government did to help its exports was to take $3½ billion worth of tax off its exports. It was totally opposed by the Labor Party, but it was one of the best things that you could have done for the exporters, one of the best things that you could have done for rural and regional Australia and one of the best things that you could have done for a world which is now in a subdued situation and turning down not just in the United States but in the whole of Asia as well. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. I cannot, without consulting the forward estimates, precisely identify the figure that has been appropriated or will be appropriated for government advertising. But let me say quite plainly to the honourable gentleman that the government makes no apology for informing the Australian public of their benefits. We make no apology at all about informing them. I do not remember the Leader of the Opposition talking about university places or hip replacements when Bill Hunter was advertising Working Nation - I do not remember that at all. Indeed, I do not hear the Leader of the Opposition remonstrating with state governments that allocate resources to put a blatantly partisan point of view.I have seen one of the advertisements to which the Leader of the Opposition refers, and that is an advertisement drawing the attention of older Australians to the fact that there are benefits available in the budget. I think this is an important obligation. Unless the Leader of the Opposition imagines that this is unnecessary, could I inform him that in the preparations for the budget we were looking at the possibility of providing some additional assistance to older Australians who, unlike home buyers - particularly, might I say, home buyers in the division of Aston - do not get the benefit of a $300 a month reduction in their mortgage interest rates since March 1996. Older Australians do not have the benefit of lower interest rates, and that is one of the reasons why we decided to provide some more help for them. I was quite surprised and my colleagues were quite surprised to learn that a very significant number - indeed, tens of thousands - of older Australians who were entitled to get the Commonwealth seniors health card as a result of the liberalisation that occurred two years ago in the 1999 budget brought down by the Treasurer had simply not taken up their entitlements.Here you have a situation where a benefit is significantly expanded and yet tens of thousands of people entitled to that benefit have not taken it up. The reason they have not taken it up is, I think, in part due to the fact that they are not aware of it, and I think it just underlines the fact that it is important for any government to carry out the sort of advertising to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred. And it is sheer humbug of him, given his performance in government, to say otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his question. Can I start my answer by saying that, by the standards of the world, Australia has not only a very fair and clean and open electoral system but also an extremely efficient one. It has been organised over the years on a nationally coherent basis, and I know that many Australians would have compared the national consistency of our system very favourably with that of the United States at the time of the last presidential election. Having said that, there is always room for improvement. It is not something about which we should be complacent. I understand that there has been tabled in the parliament a report from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I have to say that in the time available I have not had an opportunity of reading the report, although I have been advised of some of its recommendations. I have in particular been advised of a recommendation that, in future, people who seek to get on the electoral roll should have to produce some identification. I have to say that at first blush it has always struck me as rather odd that you need more identification to get a video than you do to get on the electoral roll - that is a very odd circumstance. Whilst this is a matter that will need to be taken through the proper processes of the government and of the government parties -  - I notice it is getting an excited response from those who sit opposite, Mr Speaker. The idea that you should actually have to establish your identity to get on the electoral roll is drawing bitter reaction from the member for Melbourne. Very, very, very interesting! Anyway, that is one of the recommendations. We will examine that recommendation and in due course make a decision. I will seek the views of my colleagues on that matter. I know that many of them have views, because they are concerned about maintaining the reputation of Australia for running fair, clean and open electoral contests. It is only when you have fair and open and clean electoral contests that you get the right result.There are a number of other recommendations. I know one of them puts forward a principle that I have often heard enunciated in this parliament - including, I must say, from some members of the Australian Labor Party - and that is the principle of one vote one value. I think behind this is the notion that inside a political party there should not be A and B class shareholders; there should not be a group of people in a political party who have more clout than their numbers would warrant.I have to say, speaking not only as Prime Minister but also as the leader of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party, that it is not a change that would give us any trouble, because we are a party that is very broadly based. We do not have bloc votes on the floors of state conferences dominated by trade unions, like others in this parliament have, and I cannot imagine either that this is a sort of change that would give any trouble to my good friend and colleague the Leader of the National Party of Australia, because this is also -  - But, as with the other amendments - the changes - we will have a look at them; we will examine their practicality. As I say, I have not had a chance to read the report, but I have got to say that at first blush the idea of asking somebody to prove who they are before they get on the electoral roll does not strike me as a particularly outrageous proposition.</DOC>

 - I say to the member for Lilley, as I said in response to the question asked by his leader: as to the precise amounts I would have to consult the budget papers, but I can assure him that the benefits available -  - the benefits available under this budget, which are very valuable benefits, particularly to older Australians, will be properly communicated to the people who are entitled to receive them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, and can I say by way of response that, yes, I am aware of those claims. Those claims have been made by the Leader of the Opposition, who, having failed to talk down the Australian economy, is now trying to talk down our investment in education. The Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a first-class honours degree in only one thing, and that is talking down his own country. The Leader of the Opposition has tried it in relation to the economy, and no wonder even normally favourable journalists - well, let me say journalists that do not normally favour the side of politics that I lead; let me put it that way - such as Ken Davidson, in the Age on 31 May this year, under the headline `Clever? No, just pathetic' -  - It is a description of the rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition -  - on the hollowness of his education mantra. The claims made by the Leader of the Opposition were seriously flawed, and the speech that he delivered to the Sydney Institute last Thursday was nothing other than a parody of the truth. It completely misrepresented the situation in so many areas. It gave a distorted picture. The claims made about investment in education were wrong. For example, the Leader of the Opposition talked about government schools. In 2002, Commonwealth funding for government schools will be $670 million more than the funding provided in the 1995 budget by him when he was Minister for Finance. This represents a 42 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding for government schools over the last Labor budget in 1995-96. I go on: according to the latest OECD report on education entitled Education at a glance: 2001 released last Wednesday - that is, the day before the Leader of the Opposition made his speech - Australia's total investment, public and private, in primary, secondary and post-secondary, non-tertiary educational institutions is above the OECD average at 3.80 per cent. - It is above the OECD average, but this man opposite would represent to the Australian people that we are slipping below the OECD average, yet the OECD's own report - a day before he makes the speech - showed that we are in fact above the OECD average. The OECD average was 3.71 per cent. Ours was 3.80 per cent. Ours is higher than Germany's at 3.68 per cent and the United States's at 3.74 per cent. But it goes further: expenditure per full-time equivalent student in Australia is above the OECD average for primary and secondary schools, training and higher education. Total Commonwealth spending on education will be 17 per cent higher in real terms in 2001-02 than it was in 1995-96. Instead of it going down, it has gone up by 17 per cent in real terms. We then go on to vocational education and training, and here we have a remarkable story to tell. It is a story of where this government has revitalised the dying apprenticeship and training system of this country. It is a story of not a 50 per cent increase but a doubling of the number of young Australians in apprenticeships and traineeships. The level of people in those places had remained almost static for a period of about 20 years, but in the time that we have been in government, and as a result of our increased investment and a policy focused on achieving outcomes that benefit the community, the number of apprenticeships in Australia has more than doubled and there are currently about 300,000 young Australians in apprenticeships.This government has increased funding for vocational education and training by 34 per cent since 1995-96. In this current financial year the federal government is spending $1.66 billion on vocational education and training, compared with $1.23 billion in 1995-96. Once again, the Leader of the Opposition is revealed and exposed as having deliberately misled the Australian people on the level of commitment in the area of vocational education and training. It is estimated in relation to universities that total revenue available to higher education institutions, from all sources, will be a record $9.5 billion in 2001, which is around $1.2 billion more than was available to universities in Labor's last full year in office. Once again, according to the OECD, government investment in university education in Australia, at 1.09 per cent of GDP, is higher than the OECD average - not lower but higher than the OECD average. This is government investment, not government and private. -  - Oh, the OECD is wrong! Not only are we wrong but Alan Greenspan is wrong, the OECD is wrong and the IMF is wrong! The next thing you will be saying is that Tony Blair is wrong! That would really be amazing.Combined public and private investment in university education in Australia, at 1.59 per cent, is also higher than the OECD average of 1.33 per cent. Australia's investment is higher, as a proportion of GDP, than that of Germany or the United Kingdom, both in government investment and combined public and private investment. Of the total investment in universities in Australia, 0.4 per cent of GDP is spent on research and development, which once again is higher than the OECD figure of 0.34 per cent. Those on this side of the House would be aware that in January this year I announced through Backing Australia's Ability a $3 billion program to further invest resources in the expansion of Australia's knowledge base. You therefore have a very clear comparison in an area identified by the Leader of the Opposition himself as being so tremendously important, as it is, to the future of this country. You have, by comparison, a government that not only has increased its level of commitment but is making further commitments to the future. On the other side, you have a Leader of the Opposition whose only stock in trade is rhetoric, and dishonest rhetoric at that. </DOC>

 - I am touched by the member for Wills's new-found, unbounded faith in financial institutions - very interesting. Let us make a note of that: the member for Wills says that, if a financial institution says something, you do not have to do anything about it. Does that leave your corporate governance policy in the dustbin? Are you just going to rely in future on moral suasion rather than any changes? It is very important to tell people of the end of the financial institutions duty, Mr Speaker - which, let me remind you, you voted against. You voted against it, remember? Remember when you lined up to oppose the abolition of the -   - Oh, we are wrong! I see. So we are wrong on this too! How could we get it so wrong! -  - The member for Hotham says, `Oh no, we didn't vote against it; we only sort of voted against the means to finance the abolition of it.' In other words, he is in favour, along with his leader, of spending more, he is in favour of having a larger budget surplus and he has found a magic way of abolishing the financial institutions duty as well. The member for Hotham really is the original magic pudding.Let me simply say to the member for Wills that I think the experience of members on both sides of the House has been, over the years, that you should never assume, just because you have made one announcement about a budget measure and because it has been communicated in various interviews, that there is a widely disseminated understanding within the community of the announcement. Nor should you assume that every corporate institution in this country automatically, with alacrity and from the very first time that it ought to do so, delivers every single benefit that it ought to deliver to its customers. I have great faith in corporate Australia. I think I probably have a bit more faith in corporate Australia than the member for Wills, who spent, I imagine, a large part of his public career in fact attacking corporate Australia. Nonetheless, I think it is necessary to inform the consumers of Australia of their rights.The really good news on 1 July is that financial institutions duty will go, courtesy of tax reform. The other bit of good news on 1 July is that the company tax rate will fall to 30 cents in the dollar, courtesy of taxation reform. The other bit of good news on 1 July is that dividend imputation credits will be available for older Australians. Of course, if you want some further indications of other good news on 1 July I commend a full-page advertisement in yesterday's Sun-Herald.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. The Leader of the Opposition has, of course, once again been trying to talk down Australia. He has been trying to talk down a country which places education right at the top of its values and where Australian parents and this government are determined to give young Australians the opportunities that Labor denied them and that the Leader of the Opposition denied them when he was in office. We remember what his attitude was to education, as he acknowledged to his biographer when he became Minister for Employment, Education and Training: I had sort of finally got to accept that I would never be Defence Minister again, so I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining ...  I thought that there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than in just about any I have had.We saw the Leader of the Opposition last week relying on a report from the Chifley Research Centre. It will probably be known from now on as the `Hanrahan report': 'We'll all be rooned,' said Hanrahan, 'before the year is out. That was the message from the Leader of the Opposition. But, unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, the authoritative OECD had just published a report which showed that Australia was well ahead of the OECD on all significant indicators. In relation to science and research in particular, public investment in university research in Australia is fourth in the world.Indeed, it was only a couple of weeks ago that the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Australia's e-readiness - and we know how important information technology is for education - as second only to the United States in the world. That is a measure of what this country has done in information technology. At 1.59 per cent of GDP spent on tertiary educational institutions, Australia was considerably above the OECD average of 1.33 per cent, and our expenditure on research in universities puts us in the top ranks.We have had, as the Prime Minister said, the most remarkable achievement in the last five years because, where the Leader of the Opposition left the apprenticeship system in ruins, we have built in this country in the last five years the largest apprenticeship system as a proportion of the work force in the English speaking world. In 1995 the number of apprenticeships and traineeships in Australia was the lowest for three decades as a proportion of the work force. Now, half of the young people in full-time employment in Australia are in a new apprenticeship and can get skills through being in a new apprenticeship. I am also pleased to inform the House that Commonwealth funding to the Australian National Training Authority in 2001 will exceed $1 billion. Under Labor it was $778 million in 1995.This government has invested in opportunity for young Australians. No amount of talking down Australia's educational achievements and this government's commitment to education by a Leader of the Opposition who has never had the slightest interest in education - who, as the member for Werriwa said, stuffs it up whenever he gets close to education policy - will have the slightest credibility with the Australian people, because they know that opportunities for young people are continuing to expand every year of this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is no doubt that, in broad terms, low interest rates and low inflation have put a firm foundation again under the prospects of small business right across Australia, including in rural and regional areas. And there is no doubt too that tax reform has built on those measures and that we have a proud story to tell, unlike the ALP, which plainly says that it does not care about small business.If you simply take one aspect of rural small business - that is, the farm sector - it could well be the case that interest rate reductions are saving farmers at least $1 billion a year. If you contrast interest rates now with what they were, say, a decade ago under Labor, that would probably be closer to $2 billion a year - just for the farm sector. Our export sector, which is what rural and regional Australia is about, now pays internationally competitive interest rates - not interest rates two or three times what comparable businesses in other countries pay. That gives us a foundation stone upon which small business can prosper and grow.Tax reform has unquestionably helped as well. For the first time that I can remember, Australia is back in a paddock where we have not been for a long time: we are actually exporting more than we are importing. Our terms of trade have moved in a positive direction for the first time that many of us can remember as well - the result of a lot of very hard work and a lot of very substantial reform. In addition to that, I think the Treasurer has already referred to the $3.5 billion of taxes that has come off exports. That is unquestionably - and small business and rural industries, particularly, need to be reminded of this - a major contribution that has flowed from reform of the tax system.The simplified tax system starts from 1 July so that small businesses can do their tax accounting on a cash basis, with simplified depreciation and trading stock rules. As the Prime Minister has mentioned, the company tax rate comes down then, the financial institutions duty - a subject of great interest on the other side - goes and stamp duty on shares transactions also goes, which in our country now with, I think, between five and six million shareholders is welcome reform as well. The reduction of around $3,200 on a new business car, announced in the budget, is also worth a considerable amount to small business. Then there are the capital gains tax reforms of 1999.The Labor Party on the other hand admits that it does not care about small business. The Leader of the Opposition went on record saying this in Perth last year, when he said, `We have never pretended to be a small business party.' We see that reflected of course in the position of the opposition's deputy leader, who plainly has no understanding of the importance of trusts to small businesses and farmers, who use them not for tax avoidance but to manage their assets.You then come to the issue of industrial relations. Nowhere does the citycentric view of what is good for the bush become more clear than when the ALP and the ACTU tell you what is good for you in terms of industrial relations. They have no concept of how small family businesses work out their arrangements with their employees and no concept of how the unfair dismissal law works in rural and regional areas. They continue to support an approach that says that union access to a workplace ought to be guaranteed, even if there is no union membership or no union interest in that workplace; continue to oppose youth wages, making it harder for small businesses to give young people a start in life; and continue to support secondary boycotts so that they can spread industrial disputes to companies that have nothing to do with the original dispute.These are the policies put together by big city unionists to boost the power and influence of big city unions. They were always a disaster in rural and regional Australia. If they were ever brought back, it would be a case of `back to the future'; back to the days - and we ought to remember this - when Senator Cook came to his senses on something that ought to have been done in rural and regional Australia. He said, `Let's get rid of the tally system.' He recognised that that would be good for the meat export industries in this country. What happened? What happened was that Wally Curran rang up the ACTU. We remember who was in charge of the ACTU in those days - it was the member for Batman. He said, `We can't have this.' The result of course was that the tally system remained in place to the great detriment of jobs in the bush. </DOC>

 - In the end the Australian people will of course, at an appropriate time, make a judgment about these matters. -  - I say to those who interject, with smiles on their faces and with glee, from opposite that that is a view that I stated before, during and subsequent to the introduction of the new tax system. I have never underestimated the difficult challenge facing any government undertaking major reform for the long-term benefit of the nation. The difference between those who sit behind me and those who sit behind the Leader of the Opposition is that we have put the interests of the nation first. We have not been prepared to talk down the Australian economy. The person who asked me the question is the person who, in unison with the Leader of the Opposition, absolutely rubbed his hands together with glee when those December quarter national account figures came out. They thought -  - `Not right,' he says. They spent three months going around the country endorsing every gloomy newspaper story, they spent three months going around the nation saying what an absolute disaster the GST is for the nation, but when you ask the Leader of the Opposition or when you ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, `If you should become the government of the country what are you going to do with the GST?' they say, `Really, we are going to keep it.' They hate it -  -  - Ah, roll-back! That brings me to Senator Conroy, because last week we had an endorsement from the Leader of the Opposition of the validity of what Senator Conroy said. Remember what Senator Conroy said? He said, `If you're going to roll back the GST, either you've got to cut spending or you've got to lift taxation.' Last week the Leader of the Opposition made it very clear that he was not going to cut spending. The Leader of the Opposition, in response to a news release that I put out, huffed and puffed and he said, `We're not going to cut spending; we're going to spend more.' If you are going to spend more and you are going to roll back and you going to have a larger surplus and you are not going to dud the states - because you gave them a guarantee at that meeting you had in Burnie - you are left with only one alternative, and that is to lift income tax.  The bottom line of this economic debate is that there is only one side of politics that has had the courage to do something for the long-term national interest. In the end, like every political party in this country and every government in this country, we will be judged not by opinion polls or newspaper pieces but by the Australian people. I will be happy to say to the Australian people that, in the long-term national interest, we were prepared to do something that every senior politician has known for a generation had to be undertaken for the benefit of this country. It will be forever to the credit of this government that, instead of trying to trash the national interest, as you did for three months, we have put the national interest way in front of our political interests.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. Obviously, the member has a significant number of lamb producers in his electorate that export to the United States and want to see that market opened up further and the impediments that have been placed in the way of that trade removed. We have been actively and aggressively pursuing Australia's rights and the rights of Australia's exporters within the WTO on this matter. At the end of last week we received news that the United States administration clearly indicated in Geneva that they intended to implement the decision that came out of the appellate body in the WTO that the quota and the tariff regime should be removed. The US administration have also indicated that they will need a reasonable amount of time, which is yet to be negotiated, to implement those measures.From the outset we and the industry have maintained that these measures were unjustifiable and that there had not been serious injury caused to the US industry by the export of Australian product into that marketplace. Going through all the processes within the WTO, we have established that right through to the latest decision of the appellate body and we aim to continue to aggressively exercise our rights under the rules and disciplines of the WTO, whether it be for the lamb industry or for other industries engaged in trading internationally. We are now asking the United States to implement in the shortest period of time possible that decision within the WTO.We have seen a lot of commentary lately on what trade policy should or should not be, what the government is or is not doing, and we have been actively and aggressively pursuing a trade policy both multilaterally and bilaterally within our region and more broadly across the globe. We have an attitude of `Not Asia only, but Asia first'. We have been actively engaged in the region - in South-East Asia and in East Asia. We have seen rantings recently from the shadow spokesman that, within 100 days of coming to office, a Beazley government would organise a trade treaty with China, but in the same article they are saying that the first thing they are going to do is abolish the East Asia Analytical Unit within the department. Then they are going to establish a trade treaty with China. It is interesting to note that it has taken about 15 years to negotiate a position with China for entry or accession into the WTO which is going to deliver enormous benefits to Australia's exporters, and yet that is the approach. We have seen the shadow spokesman say that he is favourably disposed to what the government is proposing for improving the economic relationship with the United States. He is saying he is `favourably disposed' in one comment. Then we have the member for Griffith running around, particularly in the US, saying that may not necessarily be so - that it may not necessarily be the Labor Party's position. So, of course, Australia's exporters and some of our interlocutors overseas are a bit confused about Labor's position. Is it Beazley's position, is it Cook's position, is it Rudd's position or is it Dougie Cameron's position that we have seen recently where he almost rolled the Labor Party in terms of their trade policy? I should say their trade non-policy, because a trade policy does not exist. If you go to the Labor Party's web site, a trade policy does not exist. So we have got the shadow spokesman out there being very critical of the things that the government is achieving, yet there is no serious proposition on the direction that the Labor Party would go in the future as far as trade policy is concerned. </DOC>

 - I will obviously stand corrected if, on checking, I am wrong but it is my understanding that Networking the Nation was funded out of the partial sale of Telstra. Am I right in that? -  - Yes. My further understanding is that members opposite voted against it. In other words, they were opposed to Networking the Nation. Those who sit opposite are completely opposed to Networking the Nation. I just happen to have with me a note that lists some of the benefits that have come out of Networking the Nation. It has funded over 400 projects across Australia. This is a funding program that they voted against. - Yes, it was a badly drafted question. The answer nonetheless is that the $250 million Networking the Nation program has funded over 400 projects across Australia -  - Yes, we are very quick in implementing our commitments. He says `already' as though that is a point of criticism. We now have the Australian Labor Party saying, `Don't so quickly introduce your policies.' - We created the $250 million Networking the Nation program, which funded over 400 projects across Australia. I repeat, if the policy position of the Labor Party had prevailed, none of those programs would have been endorsed. That is why it is perfectly valid. - T2 is also a procedure that the Labor Party opposed. -  - Correct. So you opposed spending an additional $171 million that was added to the Networking the Nation fund: for building additional rural networks, $70 million; local government fund, $45 million; Internet fund, $36 million; and remote island fund, $20 million. But other initiatives funded from T2 included -  - Other initiatives funded from T2 include - and the Labor Party is against these programs - contracting Telstra through the competitive allocation of $150 million to provide untimed local calls to remote areas. I would have thought that every member would support that, but the Labor Party voted against these provisions. Other initiatives include contracting Vodafone through a competitive allocation of $25 million to provide continuous mobile phone coverage along 11 major highways, $158 million to the Building on Information Technology Strengths program and $120 million to the television fund, including fixing TV black spots in many regional and rural areas. - There are two other elements of the program, and then I will come to the question of advertising. The two other elements of advertising are $120 million for a television fund that includes fixing TV black spots in many regional and rural areas. I want the House to observe that those who sit behind me voted in favour of that fund and those opposite effectively voted against it. Finally, there is $15 million for connecting Tasmanian schools through Internet facilities. I am ashamed to note that the member for Franklin, the member for Denison, the member for Lyons, the member for Bass and the member for Braddon all voted against that. They raise the question of television advertising. I would remind you, Mr Speaker, and through you I would remind those who sit opposite, that one of the differences between the coalition's approach to the provision of community communications services in rural Australia and that of the Labor Party is that this government has instituted two very important rights for people who live in rural areas. One of them is the universal service obligation. The other is the customer service guarantee. None of those measures or guarantees existed under the former government. It is very interesting that the former government, now incarnated in the opposition, carries on about the value of 100 per cent public ownership, but when you had 100 per cent public ownership you didn't have a universal service obligation; you didn't have customer service guarantees and you didn't have a Telstra zoning review, either.  - One of the many legitimate reasons for advertising the benefits of that program is to make people who live in rural areas well and truly aware of their rights. Let me illustrate. There can often be changes in telecommunications entitlements that people may not be aware of. For example, yesterday, I am pleased to note, Telstra announced that customers in fringe metropolitan areas currently paying timed STD rates to the CBD will have the choice of a flat untimed 25c call to the CBD. For 13 years it was not the case that those sorts of entitlements existed. Now that they have been made available, people who are to get the benefits of them ought to be made aware of those benefits. It is that kind of information which, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, was invariably provided through advertising when his government was in office. This line of questioning by the Labor Party is humbug, even by their standards.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. As was announced in a measure in the budget, the government will spend $5 million informing taxpayers of their entitlements to claim excess imputation credits. Let me say, Mr Speaker, that people have never been able to claim back excess imputation credits before, because the Labor Party never allowed them to do so. From 1 July, people will be able to do it, including pensioners, but they need to know they are entitled to do it if they are to get the taxes back. Secondly, charitable and gift-deductible organisations will be entitled to claim back imputation credits, for the first time in Australian history. Many of those charitable trusts do not put in tax returns, because they have never been entitled to get back the imputation credit on shares and dividends that they may receive from those shares. The third thing is that the government will advertise the entitlement of all Australians to be relieved from the payment of financial institutions duty. The Leader of the Opposition is sending a letter around in his electorate saying that the Howard-Costello budget hands over $5 billion to the big end of town in tax cuts - to the big end of town. Some $1.2 billion is paid by the millions of Australians who are slugged with financial institutions duty, which is being abolished on 1 July, and he complains that is a tax cut for the big end of town! It is a tax cut for every pensioner in this country, for every self-funded retiree in this country, for every mother in this country and for every kid that might have a Dollarmite account with their school for saving. Some $5 billion to the big end of town? I will table that deceptive letter which has been written by the Leader of the Opposition. I am asked whether governments ever advertise tax changes that they put in place. The Labor Party, of course, would have the Australian public believe what an outrageous thing it is to publicise tax changes. What kind of unconscionable government would advertise a tax change to let people know that their tax cuts are coming? What kind of unconscionable government would do that? Let me tell you one that would do that. The Bracks-Brumby government would do that. The Financial Review of 7 May 2001 had a nice little picture of Steve Bracks and a nice little picture of John Brumby. Prime Minister, you and I ought to have our pictures on these! And it has a signature. Look at what it says. The Labor Party would never advertise a tax change? Oh, no, not the Labor Party! Steve Bracks says that less tax would create a more competitive business environment. The advertisement says:We said - Steve Bracks and John Brumby - `Let's do it.'That is what John Brumby and Steve Bracks said. Then they set out all of the things that they are going to do. And have a listen to one of the things that they are going to do. This is Mr Bracks and Mr Brumby, outrageously putting advertisements in the newspaper. One of the things they are going to do is this. Let me quote: These cuts -  -  - Yell louder, because you might drown me out. Come on, louder, Gavvie. This is what they are going to do in addition to all of their cuts. This is what they say: These cuts - this is Bracks and Brumby - are in addition to the abolition of Financial Institutions Duty ... The Victorian Labor government talk about the abolition of the financial institutions duty. The advertisement says: These cuts are in addition to the abolition of Financial Institutions Duty and stamp duties on quotable marketable securities from 1 July. They are not only advertising their tax cuts; they are advertising our tax cuts. You had better ask a question of Mr Bracks and Mr Brumby about how outrageous it is that they are using taxpayers' money to advertise our tax cuts. That is one of the reasons why we do advertise: to make it clear who is abolishing the financial institutions duty. It is not Mr Bracks and Mr Brumby. That is being totally funded by the GST revenue. They sit back in Melbourne and take their cheque every month. As the GST revenue grows, they abolish financial institutions duty and stamp duties on marketable securities, they advertise the fact that they are doing it, and they get out and inform taxpayers. This is hypocritical. I often say, `Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor.' I table the famous Bracks and Brumby advertisement.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Pearce for her most excellent question. Members would be aware that on the weekend the Australian Metal Workers Union claimed that employment in the manufacturing sector had fallen by some 75,000 in the life of the Howard government. Let me make it very clear that this claim by the Metal Workers Union is wrong. It is absolutely and completely false. The Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that, since May 1996, employment in Australian manufacturing has actually increased by over 10,000 workers. The metal workers also announced on the weekend a $400,000 marginal seats advertising campaign to support the Beazley opposition. Last week in Workforce, the newsletter of the Metal Workers Union, Doug Cameron was saying, `Economic circumstances forced us to make some tough decisions.' Then he goes and spends $400,000 on an undeclared political donation to the Australian Labor Party, on top of the $680,000 the Metal Workers Union gave last year. Any claim by the Metal Workers Union, allegedly in protection of jobs, comes a bit rich from a union whose leaders are substantially a bunch of New Age economic Luddites. Last year, the Metal Workers Union masterminded Campaign 2000, a job destroying campaign directed at no fewer than 50,000 employers in the metal industry around Australia. Just last week, a Metal Workers Union picket line, led by no less a person than Craig Johnston, the Victorian state secretary of the union, conducted a smash and grab raid on two Victorian businesses and caused no less than $300,000 worth of damage. I quote from the Age newspaper:A man used a crowbar to smash down the entrance to the skilled offices in Whitehorse Road. Once inside, a group of about 40 men tossed computers on the floor, upturned desks, hurled chairs through windows and smashed pot plants while scared staff stood by.This is the economic equivalent of a home invasion masterminded by a union affiliated to the Australian Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition says he wants to strengthen unions' right of entry. Obviously this is the kind of goon squad activity that the Leader of the Opposition has in mind. -  - This is the union which actively encouraged violence at the S11 protest last year. This is the union which is now preparing protests at the Commonwealth Heads of Government conference later this year. This is the union from which the Leader of the Opposition is happy to accept $680,000 a year. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to reiterate the former Labor government's commitment to low tariffs. If the Leader of the Opposition had any decency, any integrity and any ticker, he would immediately repudiate this union's disgraceful conduct. He would repudiate the comrades of the AMWU.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Some money was reallocated because the amount originally allocated was more than we required. I am extremely happy at any time to have the government's record -  -  - It does not mean that simplified billing will be any slower. I would point out that simplified billing is something the Labor Party could never have dreamed of. Nor could they have dreamed of the 30 per cent rebate, lifetime health cover, prudential reform, reform of prostheses and a 45 per cent insurance rate. We are happy to have our record on this put up against theirs any time. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. I appreciate the interest that he, as a Queenslander and as a Brisbane MP, is showing in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which will be held in Brisbane in October. This is a very important meeting for Australia. It is a meeting where we will host in our country somewhere in the vicinity of 40 heads of government from all around the world. I think it will be yet another example, as was the Sydney Olympics, where we can showcase Australia to very great effect.No doubt the meeting will have many issues on its agenda. It will be a great occasion for ministers, presidents and prime ministers from around the world to address some of the key issues that the international community faces. I think that just about all Australians would hope very much that Brisbane puts on a good performance, that Australia puts on a good performance, and that the whole CHOGM meeting will reflect well on our country.It comes as a matter of concern to me, to the government and, I think, to most Australians that Mr Doug Cameron of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union said on a television program that his union was going to use its members' money to bankroll demonstrations planned for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I will be frank: it does not help Australia to have demonstrations of that kind at a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting where we have the eyes of the world upon us. I would have thought that any major political party would want to do what it could to discourage demonstrations of that sort. After all, it is an unedifying thought to have demonstrations in our country against the likes of President Mbeki, Prime Minister Vajpayee or Prime Minister Blair and a long list of other heads of government who will be here.Yesterday on television the member for Kingsford-Smith was asked quite openly whether he supported the AMWU financing these demonstrations. It is perfectly clear from what the member for Kingsford-Smith said that he would not repudiate the funding of these demonstrationsthis from the spokesman for foreign affairs, who you would think would want to make CHOGM a success and who would not want to be encouraging demonstrations against leaders of the world. -  - Members behind me say, `What does Rudd say?' What would the member for Griffith, a Brisbane member, think of his spokesman for foreign affairs not condemning and not rejecting the funding of demonstrations by the unions? It gets to the heart of what the Labor Party is about. It wants to walk on both sides of the street. I suppose that when the demonstrations happen it will say, `Oh well, that's a little regrettable' - all the time, of course, giving a wink and a nudge to Doug Cameron and the AMWU funding the demonstration. Of course, as the Minister for Employment Services pointed out, this is the union which provided $680,000 to the Labor Party last year and is running an advertising campaign for the ALP. No wonder the discredited spokesman for foreign affairs will not condemn the funding of these demonstrations. It is an indictment of a major political party that aspires to come to government that it should condone demonstrations of this kind against leaders of the world.</DOC>

 - Can I say in response to the honourable gentleman's question that I am aware of these studies. I am aware of them because an event last week provoked me to revisit the writings, material and research on the subject of where Australia sits in relation to knowledge and intellectual capital and whether or not it is an old or a new economy.A constant refrain of the Labor Party was repeated last Thursday when the Leader of the Opposition addressed the Sydney Institute. I have to say that, for a speech that was given a huge build-up, none has unravelled quite so rapidly as has the speech that the Leader of the Opposition delivered last Thursday. This was going to be an absolute knockout blow in the debate on education! Not only did he fail to tell the Australian public what he would do if he were in government but, worse than that, he got all his facts wrong - he got just about every last fact completely wrong. Of course, the claims made by the Leader of the Opposition were based on some material put together for Labor's think tank, the Chifley Research Centre, by Simon Marginson and others, and the Leader of the Opposition had, amongst other things, this to say - and it is very telling:It shows that Australia is failing to make the grade in those crucial areas that will determine our success as a nation in the 21st century.That is what the Leader of the Opposition said last Thursday. That sits in very, very strange contrast to the findings not of the Chifley Research Centre or even of the Menzies Research Centre but to the findings of none other than the International Monetary Fund. - `Oh!' the member says. We in the Labor Party don't worry about the International Monetary Fund; we don't worry about the OECD either! I inform the House that in April of this year the International Monetary Fund released a report titled `Is Australia a New Economy?' According to an analysis by somebody who is not really identified with my side of politics - indeed, the former economic adviser to my predecessor, Dr John Edwards - this IMF report:... comes to the startling conclusion that Australia has been investing in information and communications technology more rapidly than any other country, including the United States.They are the words of Dr John Edwards, the former economic adviser to Prime Minister Paul Keating, and they completely demolish the false argument being advanced by the Leader of the Opposition. In an analysis that he prepared under the heading `Australia as an ITC World Leader', he came to these conclusions in relation to the IMF report: ITC investment in Australia has grown at double-digit rates since the middle of the 1980s, so rapidly that investment in hardware and software accounted for over 20 per cent of total non-building investment last year compared to six per cent in 1986. Looking at total spending on ITC as a share of GDP shows that Australia was second only to New Zealand and well above the United States and all other OECD countries.This is not the performance of a nation that is falling behind. This is the performance of a nation that is leading the world. This is the performance of a nation that ought to be proud of its intellectual capital. The Leader of the Opposition failed to talk down the Australian economy; he now wants to talk down our intellectual capacity. I suggest that he should turn his attention to today's Sydney Morning Herald. There is an article in the IT supplement. It is not a bad read, I've got to tell you, Mr Speaker. It is written by somebody by the name of Graeme Philipson, who isn't always noted in this supplement for saying favourable things about the government. He says this, amongst other things:But we don't do so badly when we compare ourselves with other places. When it comes to IT, Australia is a very clever place indeed, it would seem....			...			...So, by any measure Australia is a large and advanced user of IT. He talks about the great example of Queensland's Mincom:... which has become the world's largest supplier of software to the mining and railway industries.He goes on to say:Figures from market researcher GartnerGroup show that Australia's IT services industry is nearly as large as that of South-East Asia, India and China combined. This is where most of the truly innovative - dare we say, clever - action is.He goes on to conclude this:IT is a truly global industry, and Australia is a major player. It is time we stopped pretending otherwise.I think those words should echo through the meeting rooms of the Australian Labor Party to drive home to them the fact that there is no profit in talking down Australia, there is no profit in talking down the Australian economy and there is no profit in talking down Australia's intellectual achievements. The Leader of the Opposition has nominated knowledge and education, and investment in them, as very important issues in the Australian national debate. My advice to the Leader of the Opposition is: before you foray any further into this area, get your facts right.</DOC>

 - I remind the Leader of the Opposition that all of the material that he refers to has been carried out strictly in accordance with the guidelines that were laid down by his government. On top of that, I would remind him that they are guidelines, I understand, that were reissued early in 1995, and they spoke of the need to keep people fully informed. They spoke of the obligation that rested upon government departments to make certain that programs they had introduced were widely understood in the Australian community. It has been part of the opposition's questioning on this issue of government advertising to imply, for example, that there is absolutely no justification for spending any money in drawing people's attention to the existence of the $300 bonus to people of pensionable age. The argument is advanced by the Labor Party that everybody who is entitled to that will have the money automatically paid to them. That is the basis of the Labor Party's claim. That claim is untrue. About 30,000 people, it has been calculated, are entitled to receive this benefit. They are people of pensionable age who are outside the social security or taxation systems, and, unless a campaign is conducted by the government to draw the attention of these people to the benefit that is available, then those people are going to miss out.  - I simply make the point that there are 30,000 Australians of pensionable age who will not have the $300 automatically paid to them because they are outside the social security system and the taxation system. The only way you are going to reach those people is to draw their attention to their entitlement, because there is no existing payment connection between them and the government at the present time. Apparently, as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, he doesn't care about those 30,000 people. I might also add that the Leader of the Opposition has been flinging around a figure of $20 million a month. I am advised by the Minister for Defence that that includes $3 million a month in relation to defence advertising. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition wants us to stop trying to increase recruitment to the Australian Defence Force.</DOC>

 - It does not surprise me that the member for Eden-Monaro, who magnificently represents in this parliament many people who are employed by the Australian Public Service -  -  - It is the case, as the member for Eden-Monaro alludes to in his question, that this week we are celebrating 100 years of the establishment of the Australian Public Service. I know that I speak on behalf of all members of the parliament in putting on record in this place the appreciation of the Australian people, through the government, for the contribution that has been made by the men and women of the Australian Public Service over the last 100 years. I think Australia has had an extremely professional and committed Public Service of great integrity. It is a Public Service that has faithfully served governments of different political persuasions over the last 100 years. I will have the opportunity later today at a gathering to say a few words about the role of the Public Service now and into the future and also to more directly express to the men and women of the Australian Public Service our very great appreciation for the contribution that they have made.The Public Service now of course is very different from what it was 100 years ago. Like all other parts of society, it has changed significantly over that 100-year period. I am very pleased to have led a government that through the passage in 1999 of a modernised Public Service Act has significantly reflected the changed economic, bureaucratic and social circumstances in which the Australian Public Service operates. The interrelationship of the Public Service to government and the role of private office staff of course have undergone a very significant change in the 27 years that I have been a member of this place. But one constant, I believe, has been the commitment of the men and women of the Australian Public Service to give high quality advice, to give it fearlessly and to give it with the best interests of Australia at heart. I thank them for that contribution and I wish them well in the years ahead. </DOC>

 - I will say a couple of things. It is true that, because of a number of initiatives of the government, in 1998, 1999 and 2000 there were abnormally large amounts of money spent on advertising. I have not sought in any way to disguise that. That is because we have actually done something in the years that we have been in government. Of course, if you do not do anything you have nothing to advertise. If Labor should ever stumble into office they will not be troubled by this problem, but I happen to lead a government that had the courage to introduce taxation reform that this country has needed for 25 years and I happen to lead a government that advertised in an entirely proper way the details of that tax plan in 1998. That exercise was in fact run past - to use that expression - the Auditor-General and he gave it a tick.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. Low interest rates benefit Australian families. When this government was elected the home mortgage rate was 10½ per cent; today it is 6.8 per cent. For an Australian family on an average mortgage of $100,000 that is a saving of $300 a month. Australian families today are saving $300 a month compared with the rates they were paying the last time the Labor Party was in office. Let me take it further. The last time the Labor Party held the Melbourne seat of Aston, home mortgage interest rates were 17 per cent. The last time the Labor Party held the seat of Aston, a family on an average mortgage was paying $850 a month extra in interest on the average mortgage, and that is after-tax money. If you were on the top marginal income tax rate, you would have to have been earning $1,700 a month before tax to be in the same position as you currently are.I am asked whether there are any threats to low interest rates. The main threat to low interest rates sits opposite at this table. The person who presided over interest rates of 17 per cent back in 1990 and back in 1996 -  - No, this is not playing the man; this is stating facts. Unfortunately, facts undermine your man. That is his major problem. The last time he was in office he had interest rates at 10½ per cent. There was a seminar here in Parliament House on 6 June with Chris Murphy from Econtech. - Chris Murphy, who was retained by the Labor Treasurer of Tasmania to model for the Labor government in Tasmania and who was retained by Dr David Crean as his preferred modeller - yes, that Chris Murphy. - He was doing a seminar here on 6 June and he was asked a question about roll-back - whether he had done any modelling on roll-back. He said this: `If roll-back amounted to $4 billion' - and I cannot imagine -  - I was coming to some modelling which has been done by Chris Murphy from Econtech. He was asked a question about whether he had modelled roll-back. He had modelled $4 billion - and we cannot imagine that the roll-back would be only $4 billion, not after five years of opposing GST - and the effect it would have. This is what he said:If roll-back amounted to $4 billion of stimulus, it would put the budget well into deficit, it would add up to 100 basis points to interest rates and would send the current account deficit back up.Now, $4 billion of roll-back equals one per cent on your mortgage. The people of Aston ought to know this: if roll-back is $4 billion, that is another $80 a month; if roll-back is $8 billion, that is $160 a month, and start counting from then. Roll-back is a policy to roll up home mortgage interest rates. The Labor Party did it before; they will do it again. When you hear `roll-back', it means home mortgage interest rates go up and every family in Australia would be penalised under a policy of roll-back. No wonder the Leader of the Opposition will not come clean on it. No wonder he will not tell the people of Australia what he has in mind for them. It all ends in the same place - higher interest rates and more pressure on the families of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Calwell for the question. I checked the transcript after that interview on the World Today and the transcript will reveal that I did no such thing. There was no assertion in that program that I rebutted by saying, `No baton existed.' What I have indicated is that there are used, from time to time, batons which conform with the type used by state police forces, which are aluminium coated, I believe, by a form of plastic or rubber. I have made the point that detention officers are not armed. When it was suggested - but it was not in that program, I might say - that there was some form of baton that was not standard issue, I was interested to see whether or not that could be sustained. From what I gather, the item that was produced to you was standard issue. Let me deal with the question of what happened at Port Hedland. I facilitated your visit. You met with some detainees and they made certain allegations to you. I have said in relation to any allegations that are made concerning events that have occurred in detention centres that, if there are substantive issues, they should be the subject of full and complete investigation by the authorities who have the competence to deal with allegations - that is, to test them. I have indicated that I would ask HREOC to undertake such an inquiry in relation to the matters that you raise. I caution you not to accept at face value statements that have been made by people who have an interest in undermining the system of mandatory detention. The fact is that in relation to the particular events that took place on that day, the police, when allegations of assault were raised, had the opportunity to see the videotapes of what was occurring at that time. There was clearly no evidence upon which any charges of assault could be brought. A representative of the detainee population was authorised to see the same video and confirmed that view. It is a fact that some people shouted out at the time that a minor was being assaulted. That was untrue. Some people may have heard that shout, but the statement has been tested and was found to be untrue.I would simply ask members to keep a sense of proportion about these matters. The detention centres are open for organisations like the Ombudsman, for others like HREOC and the UNHCR and for members of parliament to be able to visit and for a wide range of community representatives to be able to visit if they have had an invitation from detainees. The reason that we do not simply have a visitors day at detention centres is very clear. If people are making substantial claims for refugee status, there are substantial issues about their identity and the protection of their identity that need to be addressed. You would know from some of the comments that detainees themselves have made that, when their identities are exposed in the Australian media and there is a possibility that family members that are left behind might be identified, they are concerned when those matters are produced in that way. I simply caution people to protect people's privacy and to recognise that there are some people who are found not to be refugees who are being held for removal and who believe that, if they behave inappropriately, if they put us under duress, they will obtain different outcomes. I simply affirm what I have said before: I will not compromise in relation to the integrity of the system that ensures the protection of refugees but also ensures that those who are not refugees are available for removal.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. The introduction of the new tax system has put the tax office in a position to ensure much stricter compliance in relation to income tax obligations. Whereas the amount of revenue which has been raised from GST is almost right on what was budgeted originally, there is now strong evidence that income tax and company tax collections have been higher as a result of increased compliance through the GST system. If you take an example, a barrister is required to charge GST on a fee they render to a solicitor and a solicitor is entitled to get an input tax credit in respect of that GST, but only if they have a tax invoice, which requires an Australian business number. In other words, they only want to deal with people that have Australian business numbers. For people who have not been inside the tax system and do not have Australian business numbers, the introduction of the GST system has put them in a lot of difficulty. Those people, if they want to be able to do business-to-business transactions, have been required to come inside the tax system and to get Australian business numbers. The government originally estimated that the number of Australian business numbers that would be issued was 2.1 million. The total number that has now been registered is 3.5 million - significantly in advance of what the government itself estimated.  The system of tax invoices also gives the tax office the opportunity to trace those invoices down the supply chain, because, if the tax invoice is registered with the number of the business, the tax office has the ability to go and visit that business and to trace down the chain whether or not that business is complying with obligations. On our side of the parliament, we believe in lower company tax and lower income tax, but we believe that the lower rates of both income tax and company tax which we have put in place should be paid by all Australians - that Australians should pay their fair share, and no more, and that, if all Australians are paying their fair share, other Australians will not have to pull the weight for those who in the past have been cheating their obligations. Let us make this entirely clear. The biggest advance in cracking down on the black economy in this country was the introduction of the GST and ABN system. The political party that opposed the biggest crackdown on the black economy and tax cheating in this country was the Australian Labor Party. Let us make no bones about it. The Australian Labor Party was prepared to oppose a system which has given a much greater capacity to ensure that people who formerly evaded their responsibilities were brought into the tax system. Today, all Australians have had the benefit of income tax cuts - for average earners, now a marginal income tax rate of 30 per cent right up to $50,000; for companies a reduction in the company tax rate to 30 per cent. As all Australians pay their fair share, all Australians benefit from a fairer tax system.</DOC>

 - I do not know where the Leader of the Opposition gets an imminent interest rate rise from, because during this year interest rates have been falling. In fact, he took great delight in saying that they were falling because of the GST. Do you remember that? He was out complaining all through the course of this year that interest rates were falling, and that that was because of the GST -  - notwithstanding the fact that he was out complaining all through 1999 that interest rates were rising, and that that was all because of the GST. Mr Speaker, the fact of the matter - and you can correct me if I am wrong - is that the home mortgage interest rate today is 6.8 per cent. When the Labor Party left office it was 10½ per cent and when the Labor Party last held the electorate of Aston back in March 1990 -  - it was 17 per cent. These are facts. They may be embarrassing facts, but they are facts. The fact of the matter also is that, if you are to roll back the revenue by only $4 billion, you are going to put interest rates up. The Leader of the Opposition could come in here and say, `We will roll back the GST and we will make up every lost dollar with a rise in income tax.' He could say that, but he refuses to do so. He could come in here and say, `We will roll back the GST. We will make up every dollar that is lost by reintroducing the indexation of the petrol excise.' You have to listen very carefully, as I do, because not yet have I heard one senior person in the opposition give an unequivocal commitment never to reintroduce the indexation of the petrol excise. When you ask them the question, `Will you give a guarantee that there will be -  -  - The member for Melbourne just had a very sly smile. I saw it. Oh, Mr Speaker, you have to watch their faces. - I say: watch their faces; don't read their lips; listen very carefully. We are yet to have an unequivocal commitment from the Labor Party that they would not bring back the indexation of excise if elected to office. Let us remember this: it was the Labor Party that introduced the indexation of excise and we have never heard a commitment to do away with it. - Let us go back to the budget - the budget which is in surplus for the fifth consecutive time in this country. Our Canadian friends will be interested in this country. There have been five consecutive budget surpluses. It is the first time since the 1960s that that has occurred in this country. The two biggest items in relation to the budget were an increase in defence expenditure, $23 billion over 10 years - if the Labor Party were against that, tell us now -  and the cut in petrol excise and the abolition of indexation. When I hear them complain about the fact that the budget reduced revenues and the budget spent money, they are presumably complaining of one or the other, and I would like to know which one the Labor Party would reduce. We keep hearing that they are committed to defence expenditure, but, oh, the silence whenever they are asked about the indexation of petrol excise. Oh, the silence. Oh, would we like that silence to be filled in? You bet your life we would!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for the question. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, of course, represents a part of Australia where the impact of irregular arrivals is significant, and he is very much aware that in the past three years we have seen something in the order of 9,000 people arrive in Australia clandestinely. He is very much aware that, amongst that population, you have a variety of people in a variety of circumstances, some of whom will make asylum claims and may be found to be refugees, and a number of whom will be found to have no such entitlement, to be seeking immigration outcomes and to have come to Australia in the expectation that they might be able to obtain such an outcome. Most of these people have engaged organised criminals to facilitate their travel, have been free enough to travel and have the money to engage people for that task - people who are very quick to follow what is happening in Australia. They are aware of processing times and of the procedures that are followed and they inform people of the nature of claims that they should make when they come to Australia. The tapes that are used and are given back in good faith to detainees about the immigration interviews that take place are being hawked around parts of Asia, to brief people on what they might expect when they come to Australia.The fact is that people do have expectations that, if they come unlawfully, they will be able in many cases to achieve migration outcomes. It is one of the reasons, as I said earlier, that some people try to put us under duress to get outcomes that they are not entitled to. The system of mandatory detention in Australia was introduced by the former Labor government in 1992 and implemented in 1994, at a time when there was an alternative model in place, and that model envisaged that you would be able to process people's applications in particular time frames. To process people's applications in particular time frames requires their cooperation. If you put down a time frame and expect that people's applications have to be processed in that time and that you will not - let me repeat, will not - be able to stop the release of people when that time has expired, those people will sit out the time and wait until it elapses. The former government was being sued by people who were found to have been detained in excess of the time frame that was outlined in the legislation, and was being sued for false imprisonment, with damages against the Australian public.The alternative model of fixing times was implemented and failed, and the former government changed it because it found that it would not work. It was well aware of the fact that people might not cooperate in relation to their processing and so it said that the clock would stop at the time when people failed to cooperate. But even that did not stop the manipulation of the system. The fact is that, if you were to put time limits on the consideration of applications, it would have an impact, and this impact would be that people would come in the expectation that they could achieve migration outcomes and that they would merely have to sit it out.I am very conscious of the time that it takes to deal with people in detention. We process most applications, 80 per cent in fact, within 15 weeks. They get an answer within that time. But the reason that some people are held for far longer periods of time is that there is a range of other opportunities available to them to test whether decisions are lawful. Those matters are outside my hands and outside the hands of any government, because they rest with the courts. People are very often in detention for long periods of time because the system is such that, if people want to use it, they can exploit it. It is important to recognise that I have looked at alternative models and at other suggestions that have been made. I have found that every time an alternative is put up it involves release of people who have no lawful entitlement to release. That is what it involves. I have not heard any suggestion for handling these matters other than that you put people on planes and send them back and have no regard to asylum claims. I have said in relation to women and children, for instance, that I am prepared to look at an alternative detention model, and that is being developed right now for implementation, and we will see whether or not such a system might work. The reason we have mandatory detention is to ensure that people are available for processing and available for removal from Australia if they have no lawful basis to be in the country.The one country that I am aware of where this issue is quite frequently highlighted is Sweden. Look at what happens there, to assess what would happen in Australia if you were going to adopt an alternative model; that is, simply releasing people when they arrive. They have no idea about the people's health profile, they have no idea whether they pose a risk to security and they have no idea whether people are those who have committed human rights abuses. They need and have in place a system of universal identification so that they can know where people are. In other words, those who argue that you should release people have to be prepared to look at some form of universal identifier to know where people are, because there is no guarantee they are going to turn up later for processing or for removal. If you look at the numbers of people in Sweden, for instance, who are making claims, with about half our population they have significantly higher numbers of onshore claims than we have. The total cost to Sweden is over $1 billion.So alternative models do produce very different outcomes. They produce larger numbers of people coming in the expectation of migration decisions favourable to them or of being able to remain in the country regardless of whether they have a legal basis to be here. It would increase the cost very significantly. It would undermine the integrity of your migration program but, more importantly - and let me conclude on this basis -  the impact is that such an approach undermines your capacity to help those people who have far greater need. I am going to continue to press the argument that, if you have a moral view of these matters, you would be concerned about those people who are languishing in refugee camps with no prospect of going home: unsafe where they are, in need of an urgent resettlement outcome, and in some of the most deplorable circumstances in the world - and I compare those circumstances with the circumstances of those who are able to travel freely and have the money to engage people smugglers. I have to tell you that, if you are looking for refugees in need, I know where you will find them - and you do not find them coming to Australia unlawfully by boat.</DOC>

Off the top of my head, I recollect that we had an existing contract, which was why it was offered to Whybin. But if there is anything incorrect in that I will get back to her.

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. Yes, I am aware of new threats to the certainty of funding for schools. The Leader of the Opposition is not content with putting out a hit list of schools whose 100,000 parents are going to lose up to $2,000 to $3,000 per student. Labor is now attacking schools at the other end of the spectrum, such as the Murray Bridge Christian School in South Australia, new Steiner and Montessori schools, a number of Catholic parish schools and even the Nyikina Mangala Aboriginal Community School in the Kimberley.These are new schools. These schools are being established because parents judge that a particular need of families and of students is to have a new choice of school. The Labor Party is now attacking funding to new schools. The Leader of the Opposition is quite content that the Labor Party's education spokesman, Senator Carr, can run riot in the Senate and that he is now taking action which will make it almost impossible for the government to meet its funding commitments to these new schools. The Labor Party is quite up front that it does not like new schools. That is one of its capitulations to the Australian Education Union. The Australian Education Union forced it last time to introduce a policy discriminating against new schools and now we find exactly the same attitudes being expressed by the Labor Party in the Senate and by its current education spokesman, Senator Carr. This is not the only thing that the Labor Party -  - This is not the only threat to school funding which the Labor Party is putting forward over and above its hit list. Last week the member for Dobell said that the Labor Party was going to rewrite the whole non-government schools funding formula; that it was going to change the formula. There is only one reason to change the formula, and that is to take funding away from schools which are getting funding under the government's SES funding system. The Labor Party intends to reduce school funding to a wide range of schools beyond the hit list. So it is not just the 100,000 parents that are going to be hit by the Leader of the Opposition's hit list; none of the two million parents who currently send their children to non-government schools can have any certainty whatsoever that their funding will not be reduced by Labor. The Leader of the Opposition calls this reprioritisation. He has to get money from somewhere - from higher taxes or cuts or reprioritising funding - to fund his policies. One of the areas from where he is clearly going to take money is the two million parents who send their children to non-government schools. - Two million Australian parents are now under threat from the Labor Party that the support they get for their children will now be reduced. - The Leader of the Opposition was caught out last week trying to mislead the Australian public about this government's commitments to education. Labor cannot be trusted on education. It is this government which is going to defend funding justice for all Australian parents.</DOC>

 - I will investigate what has been said by the member for Lilley. I am quite certain, though, that the minister to whom he refers, who I think is doing an absolutely remarkable job in her portfolio -  - Indeed, like all of my ministers. I would have thought, without having looked at the letter, that the minister probably would have been observing the following injunction. And I think it is quite a sound injunction and perhaps, with the patience of the House - it will not take long - I should read it out:The government stresses that all Australians have equal rights of access to information about programs, policies and activities which affect their benefits, rights and obligations. The government therefore expects all departments, agencies and authorities to carry out their public information programs based on the principles which guide all of the government's relations with the community: fairness and equity. I do not think anybody in this House would argue with that; that seems a very sound principle. It goes on:All departments are required to conduct their public information programs at a level appropriate to their impact on the community, particularly where they concern the individual's benefits, rights and obligations.That is a full statement of the February 1995 MCGC guideline that was issued by the previous government. I am quite certain that the minister has been acting in the spirit of that guideline, which has been adopted and followed by this government.We are very proud of the changes that were introduced in the last budget to help older Australians. They are changes that have been widely welcomed in the community, but to have the full benefit of those changes people have got to know they exist. As I indicated yesterday and again on radio this morning, when we extended the Commonwealth seniors card, despite all of the publicity that was given at the time, we discovered that something in the order of more than 200,000 older Australians - according to the department advice - who were entitled to get that card had not applied for it. I would have thought that the member for Lilley and the Leader of the Opposition and all of those other warm-hearted characters on the other side would be interested in older Australians getting their full entitlement. - I cannot understand how on earth the member for Lilley can attack the government for wanting to tell pension age Australians what their entitlements are. I find that an absolutely extraordinary proposition. I can only say again that this government makes no apology for telling people what their entitlements are. The member for Lilley talks about looting the Treasury. He sounds as though he has been to a meeting of the board of directors of Centenary House. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore. She makes the very obvious point that good economic management, good government policy, does improve the lot of farmers and small business men around Australia. If you want any further evidence of that, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics today delivered forecasts for agricultural exports for the year ahead. The good news is that agricultural exports are forecast to rise by $2.1 billion in 2001-02 to almost $30 billion. That represents a 50 per cent increase on the figures that were achieved when we came to office; and those exports are good news for the farm sector that spreads across the board. The forecasts suggest that there will be increases in exports for wheat, barley, rice, beef, veal, live cattle, sugar, wine and a whole range of other products. There will also be increases in the prices received on the export market, up something like 20 per cent over the last two years.Those sorts of statistics are delivering positive outcomes also at the local level. There have been significant reductions, according to the last reports, on the level of farm debt. There has been a tripling of the amount of money in farm management deposits over the last two years - again, a clear demonstration of the success of this government's policies in that regard. Of course, the number of people employed in agriculture has also benefited, up from 114,000 to 124,000 under this government - more people employed in agriculture.Of course, none of that could have happened under Labor. It simply could not have happened under policies of high inflation, increasing debt, 22 per cent-plus interest rates, an antiquated tax system - those were the sorts of policies that Labor delivered and that farmers had to endure. It is quite clear that, had Labor continued in office, the same sort of incompetence would have continued. Some opposite like to ask us to believe that, if they were to be returned again, somehow or other it would all change, that Labor would be better economic managers next time. Well, not too many farmers are likely to believe that, with a shadow minister who is asleep at the wheel and who could not care less about agriculture, with no interest in it whatsoever. Just look at Labor's web site on agricultural policy: it is in a coma; it has not moved for ages. In fact, the last thing I noticed on the web site was their policy on dairying -  - Yes, on dairying - the honourable member interjects - and the key item on Labor's dairy policy was that they are going to establish a task force under the shadow minister. And I think some of us actually saw this task force - one or two of them being dragged around the countryside to pretend to take some interest in it. But the interesting thing about the web site - and this is the web site today, I might add - is that this task force will report back by the end of April 2001. It strikes me that we may have gone a bit beyond the end of April. In fact, two months have passed and still no sign of the task force report! So this is Labor's agricultural policy: a task force report on dairying two months out of date, not a single thing in sight. And that is the kind of approach we can expect of course from Labor in government. It is interesting to note that Prime Minister Blair abolished the agricultural portfolio altogether when Labour came back into office in the latest UK election. That is a pretty clear signal. I think the Leader of the Opposition is pretty keen on the policies of Prime Minister Blair. Is that the sort of treatment that farmers can expect under a Labor government - the portfolio going altogether? They will not notice - the shadow minister is asleep anyhow - but certainly farmers need a positive, aggressive government that will deliver the good economic policies that can deliver spectacular export results like those that have been announced today.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member of Cowan is yes to the first question and yes to the second question. There was a regrettable error. It was drawn to my attention. Self-evidently, the minister could not personally get in touch with each of the people involved. It was a mistake.  -  - Mistakes are made in large organisations and, for the benefit of those who interject from the other side, I would challenge anybody who has been associated with any government in any administration of any political persuasion to assert that there has never been a clerical error of this kind made. I am sorry it happened. Apologies have been tendered to the people involved, and I am quite certain that every effort will be made to ensure that it does not happen again. As for the last part of the question, the arguments that I have advanced in relation to the need to advertise remain valid; and, with the greatest of respect, I think there is no connection between the two things whatsoever.</DOC>

 - Thank you to the member for McPherson for her question. The member for McPherson asked me what can the government do to increase savings. In fact, the very best thing the government can do is give to every Australian income tax cuts, and we have done that in bucketloads. Today 80 per cent of Australians pay 30 cents in the dollar or less in income tax and that helps to deliver more money into the pockets of everyday Australians.The second thing we are doing is that we are delivering in full, on 1 July, the abolition of financial institutions duty. That is saving $1.2 billion a year in Australia and helps to provide incentives for savings. That averages $63 for every man, woman and child in Australia, including - even though FID is not applied in Queensland - Queenslanders. Not all of those savings are immediately obvious to consumers of course, because a whole lot of the FID payments are buried in business, so we think consumers need to be fully aware that they are getting this major incentive for savings.  I have been asked about what other policies are around when it comes to savings, and I must say that, when it comes to compulsory savings, the Australian Labor Party seems to be a little bit confused. On 7 April the member for Hotham - and I am only sorry that he is not here - Government member - We're not. - He is in the sin-bin or he is in the blood bin. He is in the blood bin. In a report in the Weekend Australian on 7 April, the member for Hotham was quoted as saying on compulsory savings and the super levy:I believe it has to be taken above 9 per cent. The level, timing and mechanism are for our review of superannuation to determine.I will table that article, Mr Speaker. Then the following day, on 8 April, in order to clarify his position, the member for Hotham put out a media release and he said:Labor has no plans to increase employer contributions to 15 per cent, as was made clear in a series of media interviews in recent weeks.So he is saying, `We're not going to 15 per cent.' I table that, Mr Speaker. I thought Christmas comes only once a year but in fact it comes twice, thanks to the truth-teller from the Senate, Senator Conroy. We should call him Senator Simon Conroy instead of Stephen Conroy. In an Australian Financial Review seminar on 7 June - I am happy to table this; there is a very extensive commentary here - Senator Conroy said:Now Simon made some references to that recently in the newspaper - talking about compulsory super - and he talked about the need to increase the level. I mean, that is the first stage of the debate. Is nine per cent enough? Does anyone really believe that nine per cent is enough to retire on for everybody?He goes on to say:Personally, I've always been in the 15 per cent camp. I think we need to have about 15 per cent in people's retirement incomes ongoing so that they have a sustainable retirement, and that gives us the sort of money to narrow the gap and to avoid having to borrow offshore. So the national savings retirement debate is critical. I can only say to all of you who have an interest in it, when Simon went out there a couple of weeks ago and said we needed to spark the debate and that we needed to talk about increasing from nine per cent, he was pilloried in the papers and unfortunately there weren't many people out there defending the debate that nine per cent is not enough.Here we have the shadow minister for financial services talking about 15 per cent and we have the member for Hotham talking about nine per cent - there is a six per cent gap. Who is paying? Where is the money coming from? Who is paying? It is a shame that the member for Hotham cannot clarify it.The member for Wills was speaking at the National Press Club today. Everyone was expecting an answer, expecting the member for Wills to explain whether it was nine per cent or 15 per cent. None of the journalists asked the question, and we ask the question today. What is the percentage? Is it nine per cent or is it 15 per cent? And, if it is 15 per cent, who is going to pay? Where is the money coming from? The Labor Party has to explain to the Australian people how it is going to pay for its policies. If it is going to pay with the employers contributions, then it should explain that that is going to be paid by employers. At the end of the day small business is going to pay; at the end of the day every Australian is going to pay, because the Labor Party cannot fund its policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It is quite incorrect to equate importance with the size of the trophy. I do understand that some of the public health community look at it in that way; I would much rather look at results. Last week I announced that 20.3 per cent of Australian adults over 18 years of age were smokers who smoked once a week or more. The daily smoking figure was 15.6 per cent. This is the best result of any country in the Western world.  - Smoking has gone down from 23.7 per cent since we started in 1997. No other Western country, as far as we can find out, has had comparable good results. The fact is that we have had an extraordinary result with smoking, one that was never achieved under Labor - in fact, we had stalled at 23.7 per cent for a number of years. We have achieved this for a variety of reasons, not just from spending money on campaigns. We have changed the calculation of excise from per stick to weight based. We have increased the excise. We have had a national tobacco strategy with the states. We have had the full phase-out of all tobacco advertising - the first time anywhere in the world that this has been negotiated - in international motor sport, and a very successful campaign. We have gone down about 0.85 per cent a year. So I would completely reject the notion that we do not take smoking seriously.  - The track record is that we have done better in this than any previous government. To simply equate it to dollars spent, as the honourable member for Fraser has done, shows he does not understand the area.On the issue of health insurance, it is entirely appropriate for the government to advise the public when there has been legislative change that affects the climate in which the private sector operates. To say that just the private sector should do this ignores the fact that we have legislative change that changes the issue on gaps. It is important that the public understand that the situation that existed under Labor, when gaps were a problem, does not exist today. We are very proud of what we have done on gaps. We have worked hard to fix the problem. It was something that Labor was never able to fix, and we are entirely entitled to tell the public that the problem that existed under Labor does not exist now.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his excellent question and for his very long-term interest in these important subjects. I am happy to inform the member for La Trobe that no registered organisation whatsoever has any institutional sway over government policy. The only sway that any registered organisations have over this government is provided by the cogency and the logic of their arguments - that is all. By contrast, the notorious 60-40 rule means that, 100 years after Federation, the Australian Labor Party is still nothing more than the political wing of the union movement.  The opposition's youth wages policy is dictated by the shop assistants union, which has the largest bloc vote inside the Labor Party, which last year donated $730,000 to the Labor Party, which has no fewer than three senior officials as caucus members -  Senators Hogg, Bishop and Collins. The opposition's right of entry policy, as we learned yesterday, is dictated by the Metal Workers Union, which has the second largest bloc vote inside the Labor Party, which last year gave $680,000 to the Labor Party and which shoehorned George Campbell into the Senate as easily as its members managed to crowbar their way into a couple of Melbourne businesses last week.The New South Wales government's workers compensation policy - let us be confident - will ultimately be dictated by the CFMEU, which last year gave $400,000 to the Labor Party and is now trying a little bit of gentle persuasion by blockading the state parliament in Macquarie Street. Decent Labor members and decent unionists know that the union bloc vote is nothing but a racket and a rort and a rip-off. Brett Evans of the Evatt Foundation said recently - and I am quoting from his book The Life and Soul of the Party:Before he knew it - and he is referring to Gary Gray, and this is a matter involving no confidence in a preselected Labor member of parliament - a fleet of mini buses had arrived from BHP with 310 unionists on board. The state secretary of the South Australian ALP had come to town as Labor's sheriff to activate a little used clause in the rule book giving affiliated union members rights in the sub-branch equal to those of party members.There is no democracy inside the Australian Labor Party. The member for Melbourne knows it, the member for Fremantle knows it; the only person who does not know it is the Leader of the Opposition, who is very happy to talk about governing the country but cannot govern his own party. Tony Blair knew that the union bloc vote was a racket and a rip-off. Kim Blur is no Tony Blair. The ultimate lesson of all of this is: if you are not allowed to govern your own party you should never be allowed to govern the country.</DOC>

 - I know that there is a bit of a rally or something on in Canberra today about the ABC. True to form, when there is a rally they always drag in the opposition leader. You can always rustle up Beazley to ask a dummy question. - Is he going to go out and address them, the way he did at a rather famous riot here a few years ago? I am nonetheless delighted, and indeed indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for asking me a question about advertising and also about the ABC. I am pleased to announce that today the Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated that the ABC has been awarded the tender for the provision of Australia's overseas television service. I am delighted to say that, as a result of tenders put forward by the ABC and SBS and another consortium, and after a proper process to select the most appropriate, the government will provide $15 million a year over five years. I do not know whether that $15 million a year was included in the Leader of the Opposition's question or whether the material on which the question was based was out of date, as was his headland speech on knowledge last Thursday. It was a headland speech on knowledge which has been unravelling ever since.Now that the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about the ABC, let me say that it is very interesting that in recent weeks the Manager of Opposition Business, who is the spokesman on matters relating to the ABC, has raised the notion of tied funding to the ABC - the idea that you give them the money provided they do certain things. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that that is wrong. That is very interesting. In an interview with the ACT branch of the Labor leadership group, the Manager of Opposition Business is quoted in the newsletter as follows: His concern about leaving it to the ABC to determine how to dispense taxpayers funds led Bob -  that is the Manager of Opposition Business, in case anybody did not know - to argue for a much more direct involvement of the government minister in identifying areas of dedicated funding. This is basically what the Labor Party have in mind if they were ever able to scramble into office and get control of the treasury bench. I simply repeat the well-known position of the government. We support an independent, adequately funded ABC. We have adequately funded the ABC. We believe in maintaining and respecting its independence. We do not always agree with its news balance or news coverage and, when we do not, we openly make known those areas where we think the ABC lacks balance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I am pleased to inform the House that today I launched CrimTrac, which is a national DNA database and fingerprint system. I would have thought, despite the inevitable political rivalry in this place, that the launch of a nationally coordinated initiative to fight crime, to catch criminals and to protect the innocent would draw unanimous support from across the chamber. I am pleased to say that, in making this announcement, the government has delivered in full on a commitment it made in the 1998 election to provide $50 million for a national policing information service. This service will contain over two million fingerprints, and the new fingerprint system is equal to or better than the best systems of its type in the world. I am pleased to inform the House that sites for the new fingerprint system are situated in about 40 locations. Many of these are in regional areas such as Kalgoorlie, Maitland, Ballarat, Bendigo, Wangaratta and Launceston, to ensure that police in regional areas have access to the same technology as those in the city.The new DNA database will form the most powerful high-tech weapon against crime yet introduced in Australia. Today we proclaim the necessary Commonwealth legislation covering our role in using and protecting the system. From today the technology is in place nationally for DNA profiles to be entered on the system. I congratulate those jurisdictions - notably New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania - which have adopted the Commonwealth model legislation in forensic procedures. I urge the remaining jurisdictions to complete the review of their own legislation as a matter of priority. I thank the police commissioners of the various states and territories for their important involvement in these initiatives. The New South Wales commissioner, Mr Ryan, said that today is an important moment in the history of Australian policing, which will enhance crime prevention and community safety. In a similar vein, the newly appointed Victorian Commissioner of Police, Christine Nixon, said that CrimTrac is an excellent example of how the states and territories and the Commonwealth are working together to harness technology for the benefit of the entire Australian community.CrimTrac joins a number of other initiatives of the Commonwealth, including our sponsorship early in our term of office of national uniform gun laws and the commitment of record amounts at a national level to fight drugs, which if maintained in the future - if recent indications are reliable - will make significant inroads into the availability of heroin and other illicit substances in the Australian community. CrimTrac is great news in the fight against crime. I thank the ministers and I thank the police services of Australia for the contribution that they are making to delivering a safer community. I take this opportunity in the national parliament, on behalf of the government and the Australian community, to record our ongoing thanks to all the police services of this country, who do such a remarkably good job in protecting us against crime and in delivering a safe and secure Australian community. </DOC>

 - The opposition really dislikes new schools and dislikes additional funding for new schools, because that has been the traditional policy of the Australian Education Union, which calls the shots in education policy for the Labor Party. The change in funding requirements for establishment grants for new schools is simply the result of parameter changes. It is of no significance when that was first known, because the government constantly brings forward parameter changes at times when it believes that that will allow the correct funding to flow through, and that is what this government has done - brought forward legislation at this time to allow that additional funding to flow through to new schools. The parameter change occurs because there is an increasing number of students in those schools. That is why the funding is required. The only obstacle to making sure that those schools are paid and do not suffer financial disadvantage is the action of the Labor Party in the Senate delaying that legislation. This gives the lie to the claim of the member for Dobell that the only schools that would be suffering financially as a result of the Labor Party's policy are the schools on the hit list of the Leader of the Opposition, because what is now obvious is that the Labor Party is planning to impose financial disadvantage on a large number of new schools that have come into existence. Many - in fact, the vast majority - of these schools are schools serving low income communities. They include Catholic parish schools and Aboriginal community schools. And we have the Labor Party getting up in this parliament and complaining that the government is helping these schools to establish themselves and seeking to make an issue of the funding for these schools. This government will stand up for funding justice for parents in communities around Australia and will continue to oppose the efforts of the Labor Party to cut funding to needy parents and needy communities for the education of their children.</DOC>

 - I say in reply to the member for Dunkley that the federal government is unequivocally committed to the construction of the Scoresby freeway. In fact, the federal coalition government is the only government that is unequivocally committed to the construction of the Scoresby freeway. It is also the only side of politics in this parliament that is unequivocally committed to the construction of the Scoresby freeway. The Labor Party is not committed to the construction of the Scoresby freeway. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition described as realistic a demand of the Greens that Labor oppose the construction of the Scoresby freeway in exchange for Green preferences in the Aston by-election. I have the quote:The shadow Treasurer, Mr Simon Crean, said the opposition wanted to reach agreement with the Greens - I bet you do - in exchange for a preference deal. `We'll consider those demands. They're realistic demands. There is no question about that.'Those three `realistic demands' were a commitment from the Australian Labor Party not to construct the Scoresby freeway. Of course, the hesitation factor in the Australian Labor Party about Scoresby does not end in this parliament. It runs straight down to Spring Street in Victoria where, amongst other things, the Chief Government Whip, the member for Ivanhoe - a very powerful figure in the Victorian government - in fact told a community meeting that Labor does not really support freeways and is not committed to Scoresby.Let me make it very clear that we are committed to Scoresby and we believe that the residents of outer metropolitan Melbourne are entitled to a modicum of transport justice, and they will get it from this government. As an earnest of this government's commitment to the construction of the Scoresby freeway, I wrote on 15 June to the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bracks, making it very clear that we were unequivocally committed, in partnership with the Victorian government, to the construction of the Scoresby freeway. We are ready to enter into negotiations with Victoria. They are, of course, the constructing authority and we need their assistance. What I ask of the Labor Party in this place is that it stop opposing Scoresby and show a bit of consideration for the people who will benefit from Scoresby. I say to the Premier of Victoria: stop prevaricating on this issue, put your money where your mouth has previously been, join the Commonwealth and deliver a decent outcome for the residents of outer metropolitan Melbourne.</DOC>

 - As I always do with questions put by the opposition that quote figures and make assertions, I take a note of them and go away and check the context. We had the Leader of the Opposition playing that little game yesterday in relation to another matter, which I realise would be out of order for me to talk about in reply to this question. The member for Corio has asked me a question about government advertising. It is fair when you are examining the issue of government advertising that you trawl through the literature on the subject. I have been trawling through the literature on the subject and I came across a very interesting piece which was first published on 24 November 1994. It was a speech delivered by the then federal employment, education and training minister, the member for Hotham - he is now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and has been up here asking a whole lot of questions about it - when he was launching the publicity campaign for Working Nation. This is what he had to say:This campaign is all about making sure that employers know of the training and other initiatives the Government is providing to make the long term unemployed more competitive and job ready.Three television commercials starring Bill Hunter bring home the message that long term unemployed people are ready and willing to work and that the Government is willing to help employers take on these people.It is essential that all people have access to the campaign's messages, including a national 13 11 80 phone-in Employer Information Line, providing instant access to information on what is available under the Federal Government's $10.3 billion Working Nation strategy to help employers to create new jobs.The member for Corio in his question referred to a figure of $20 million and he quoted some other figures. As I say, I will have those analysed, and if there is anything I can further supplement I will. In the course of the debate about government advertising, the opposition has flung around a number of figures about claimed expenditure by the government. One of the claims that it has flung around is that, under the auspices of the Australian Taxation Office and the federal Treasury, the government has spent in excess of $500 million on advertising the GST. That claim is absolutely and totally and comprehensively false.Let me explain to the House how that figure is false. Of that $500 million, $390.4 million, for openers, could not be classed as advertising at all. It included the following: $35 million for business skills, and that was used for the development and distribution of publications and information in other forms, including ethnic programs, the GST assist call centre and web sites, and $9 million for adviser education used to develop training material and provide seminars for informal advisers. Is the opposition suggesting that, with a tax change of the magnitude of the introduction of the GST, you do not fund or conduct any training seminars? Is it suggesting that you do not send out any accounting manuals? Is it suggesting that you do not spend any money at all on explaining it? The Leader of the of Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are running around this country saying that it is complicated and that the government has not provided enough information. But, as soon as the government gets out there, does the right thing and provides information to consumers and small business, they are in here yelling their heads off that this is an outrageous use of government funds. But the list goes on. Another item is organisation delivered assistance of $119 million, and that was used to contract peak professional and industry organisations to develop material and deliver seminars, workshops and clinics on the new tax system, business skills and the BAS. A direct assistance of $287 million was used to deliver 1.9 million certificates to small and medium enterprises to use with registered suppliers of goods and services, which would assist in the transition to the new system. And the list goes on. What you have here is the Labor Party deliberately and falsely telling the Australian community that we are spending $500 million on advertising the GST, hoping that the Australian public would think that we have spent $500 million on television or newsprint advertisements whereas, in reality, the great bulk of that money spent under the auspices of the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office was legitimately, with every single dollar, expended on advising the Australian people of the complexities and so forth of the new taxation system. Finally, in relation to the AAA campaign, I am informed by the department that less than one per cent of the total AAA budget commitment since 1997 has been allocated to communications activities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. As he would know, on this side of the House the government believes in lower income taxes, lower company taxes, lower capital gains taxes, the abolition of indirect taxes on transactions, the abolition of taxes on exports, the abolition of the indexation of excise on petrol and the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and its replacement with a broad based consumption tax. Are there any proposals to change the broad based consumption tax in this country? Well, not to the detail that one would imagine. After four years of the opposition promising us that they would have a policy of roll-back, we are still very much in the dark.I for one monitor all of the media that I possibly can to try to find out more in relation to what roll-back means. One of the pieces of information that came to me recently came from the station 846AM up in the Leichhardt electorate on 13 June. I ask the House to listen to this interview, because I think it is rather a revealing piece of information as to the state of the tax debate in Australia. This is how the interview went: COMPERE: Matt Tresize was on the program the other day. He's the endorsed ALP candidate for the seat of Leichhardt. He made the comment then that as soon as he gets some news on how this rollback procedure is going to unfold, he would get back to us. And he has done that today. He's with me on the line now. Hello Matt.MATT TRESIZE: G'day, John. How are you?COMPERE: I'm all right. What did you find out about the GST rollback?MATT TRESIZE: One of the things I found out is that we still don't have as much detail as I would like and as you and the listeners would like ...`So I am just getting back to you, John, to tell you that we don't know what our policy is yet!' Then, after getting back to him to tell him that the thing that he found out was that he could not really explain what the policy was, he went on to say:You know, if the Labor Party is successful in forming government after the election, we'll then be able to start a consultative process with the community that will decide exactly what we are going to do.In other words, `We'll announce what our policy is after the election, once we've decided it.' This is an opposition which has been opposing tax reform for four years. And what can it tell you about its policy? It can only tell you that it does not know as much about its policy as it would like to know. `I'm just getting back to you to tell you that I have found out we don't know what our policy is,' says Matt Trezise in the electorate of Leichhardt. How do you go into a ballot box in Leichhardt and vote for somebody who does not yet know what his policy is but is going to find out, if he ever gets elected, after the next election? We heard yesterday that a $4 billion unfunded roll-back would put up every person's interest bill, on an average mortgage, by $80 a month. Then the Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh, well, I won't have an unfunded roll-back. I'll fund that $4 billion of roll-back.' Let me give you the figures. If you wanted to fund $4 billion of roll-back, you would have to put up the petrol excise by 12.6c per litre. No wonder he intends to announce his roll-back after the election. The Labor Party is slipping around here, hoping it can slide into office not having been asked any of the hard questions and do a repeat of what it did in 1993. Remember how he boasted after the 1993 election: `We hid our tax policy and that is why we were entitled to hike the petrol excise.' He said, `We hid our tax policy so we were entitled to put up income taxes.' He said, `We hid our policy so we were entitled to put up company tax.' That is what happened in 1993.I remind the House of the words that the Leader of the Opposition said on the 7.30 Report on 23 February 2000. He said this:People are entitled to know where the Labor Party stands on the GST and the direction in which we are going. They are also entitled to know exactly what we do in the next term of government with a GST. People are entitled to know it and not be deceived.That is what he said in February 2000. And since then he has been engaging in massive deception.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. That notice, of course, is the bill that we have in place to determine the integrity of the process by which the Commonwealth does its advertising. The reason why it should come on now is that it will provide an opportunity for the Prime Minister to walk back from a well-known habit that has developed, and been noted by the Australian community, and that is of his saying one thing and doing another. Back in 1995 he said this: We will ask the Auditor General to establish a set of guidelines - about these propositions. I see the Prime Minister has turned his back on this occasion. I wonder why?and we will run all of our advertisements past the Auditor-General and they will need to satisfy those guidelines.The Prime Minister said that before the election in 1996; he said it in 1995. He has since then had an Auditor-General's report setting down a set of guidelines that responded to an earlier outrage in relation to the way in which this government used taxpayer funded advertising to feather its own nest electorally. The Auditor-General came out with that, and had endorsed by a joint parliamentary committee - both sides of the House - the sorts of guidelines entailed in this bill.The reason why it is urgent is not just to simply establish a bit of integrity here, to stop the taxpayer's pocket being picked to the tune of $120 million over the course of the next few months. The reason why it also ought to be done here is to restore a bit of integrity in the Australian political process and keep John Howard's promise. If we can stop the government right now, by the passage of this legislation right now, that $120 million would become available for things like the employment of 2,400 school teachers,  it would become available for elite fellowships to keep our teachers -  -  - The question to me was why this should be brought on now. Given the content of the bill and what is threatened over the course of the next few months, that is relevant as to why it ought to be brought on now. I appreciate your calling me on again, Mr Speaker. We have $120 million of taxpayers' funds being spent here and we can stop it. We can see this money go to schools, we can see this money go to universities, we can see this money go to the health system, to the aged care system, to restoring the Commonwealth dental program. We can see this taxpayer money being used for the ordinary people of Australia, the ordinary taxpayers, and not for the electoral prospects of the Liberal and National parties.It is important. This bill permits honest advertising that advises people of their rights and opportunities. Take, for example, the proposition under that Agriculture - Advancing Australia program referred to by one of our members in a question earlier. Each one of those farmers could be informed by one letter. Mr Speaker, as somebody who has worked on farms and has got many farming relatives, you know darn well that farmers respond quickly to any advertising on the concerns that they have. For $100,000 they could have done the job, but they could not have advertised their wares in the bush. The Prime Minister was up here defending himself as to why it is necessary -  - What I am doing here is establishing, to the man who has turned his back on me in the course of my answer, why it is necessary right now to bring this bill on, because that was the in-order question that was directed to me. - We are talking here about $120 million of the taxpayers' funds which could be stopped from being spent on this. I am pointing out that nobody has an objection to legitimate advertising. But fancy hiding behind the $3 million for recruitment for the defence department - the outrage that we saw last Sunday, that outrage in which $500,000 worth of advertising went in one day, none of which had anything to do with anything other than advertising the Liberal and National parties; taxpayer funds looted to advertise the Liberal and National parties. There is an outrage in this country about the way that was used.  The Prime Minister defends the Unchain My Heart ads that he did for the GST. Prime Minister, whatever your excuses, the Australian people have eyes: they see the advertising, they see the so-called environmental advertising, they see the GST advertising and they see the so-called labour market advertising. They know darn well that they have been misled by you. They know darn well that this promise you undertook has been breached repeatedly by you. They know that you and your colleagues are fraudulent in this matter, and they want it dealt with.</DOC>

 - My attention has been drawn; it was drawn when I read a speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition in Sydney last week? This was meant to be the knowledge headland speech; it has unravelled into a bit of a sandbar rather than a headland. One of the many things that the Leader of the Opposition said - and he was endeavouring, I know, to impress the audience and deliver a serious point - was:Australia's failure to invest in knowledge and in knowledge-based industries is directly related to the country's problems in terms of external balance, foreign debt, and the value of the Australian dollar ...The reference to the external balance clearly invites two considerations. The first of those is that in some way we currently have a very big problem with the current account deficit and, secondly, that that is in some way related to our deficit in relation to the importation of information technology. In relation to the first proposition, could I remind the Leader of the Opposition that Australia's current account deficit, as last recorded, is 2.8 per cent of GDP. That is the best result in more than 20 years, excluding the March to June quarter of 1997, which was abnormally affected by gold sales by the Reserve Bank of Australia. So the first proposition inherent in this powerful intellectual point made by the Leader of the Opposition, as he was busily trying to trash the intellectual assets of this country, was that in some way we have a problem with the current account deficit. That claim is absolutely wrong. - We have the best current account deficit in 20 years, but the Leader of the Opposition was up in Sydney last week saying, `This is outrageous! We have a problem with the current account deficit.' So the very basis of what he claims is completely wrong, and I go on to say that so far this decade Australia's current account deficits have averaged 3.8 per cent of GDP, with an average of around 4½ per cent over the past two decades. And the recent good outcomes on the balance of payments reflect the outstanding performance of Australian exporters, including, amongst other things, our mining industry.But leaving aside Australia's recent, improved balance of payments performance, the Leader of the Opposition also - and this is a habit of his - holds up the United States as an ideal. Far be it from me to criticise the performance of the United States economy. There are a lot of things about the United States economy I admire: the great flexibility of the United States economy is one of its great strengths. But it is very interesting if you translate the argument. There is no question that the US economy has benefited from its leading role in producing and using information technology. I have been trawling through a lot of the literature on this subject because the Leader of the Opposition in just about every single sentence in his speech was either out of date or plain wrong or absolutely deceptive. I found that in June of last year the US Department of Commerce released a report on the digital economy which found that, paradoxically, although America's IT producing companies are clearly world class, the United States regularly runs large trade deficits in IT goods, and it was an estimated $66 billion in 1999. So therefore not only was the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition - that we have a current account deficit problem - completely wrong, but how can you have a problem when you have got the best current account performance in 20 years?  The Leader of the Opposition said that we have a problem with our external balance, when in reality it is the best that it has been for 20 years. So he is wrong on that account - wrong, misinformed and deceptive. But he is also wrong in the claim that there is a connection in some way between performance in IT and the external balance, and that is demonstrated by the paradoxical figures that I have quoted in relation to the United States. The Leader of the Opposition tried to talk down the Australian economy. He trashed the national interest in his own selfish political interest. He was caught out on that by the outstanding economic figures that were released in relation to the March quarter. He has now turned himself to the so-called investment-knowledge issue. Not only does he not have a policy; we have a Leader of the Opposition whose statistics are out of date. His understanding is inadequate, but his capacity to deceive and mislead is absolutely boundless.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The use of technology and skills in rural and regional Australia is a very proud story. Listening to those opposite, you would think that they were still lost in the past with those references we used to get from one of their former leaders when he used to talk about Australia being a `quarry' and a `farm by the beach'. Do you remember that sort of gratuitous advice we used to get? The reality now, of course, is that rural and regional Australia is well and truly on the Net and in touch with the world through developments in telecommunications: whether it is mobile phone coverage now reaching 97 per cent of Australians - and rapidly increasing for the remaining three per cent - whether it is Internet access for all Australians by satellite in remote areas, whether it is the BITS program - nearly $80 million for seed funding for new IT businesses - or $40 million to promote the development of innovative, new telecommunications networks or whether it is the delivery of untimed local calls for people in the most remote parts of Australia. We never hear the opposition spokesman for telecommunications talking about that one: that is a practical, improved outcome in telecommunications - not something they are interested in. On the way is access to Internet dial-up speeds of much faster rates for virtually every phone link in the country. We have runs on the board in education, too: another 670 student places at regional universities and campuses. Also, there is $10 million for work placement coordinator arrangements and $35 million for Backing Australia's Ability. Then there is health and the use of modern and sophisticated technology, nine-year rural clinic schools, three university departments and the basis of a new national rural health education and training network, providing specific rural health training and encouraging medical and other health professionals to take up rural practice.In terms of skills training, there is a record $7.6 billion over four years on vocational education and training programs. Training opportunities in rural and regional areas have been boosted by $230 million. New apprenticeships, wanted for years in rural and regional areas, in rural and regional areas have doubled since December 1995, from around 50,000 to 100,000. There has also been a dramatic increase in the number of New Apprenticeships centres, up to 197 in the last 12 months. All this tells a story of a very high uptake of new technologies, particularly in the telecommunications area - the upgrading of skills that puts us at the cutting edge of the true use of knowledge, combining often with our traditional industries to put them right at the forefront globally.I was asked about alternative policies. I do not know about policies; there is an approach. It is a discussion paper called Knowledge Nation, but it almost completely misses the point. On the one hand, it acknowledges that Australia is open to technology and has competitive farm and mining industries, a strong knowledge base and a rapid uptake of new technologies. That is what it says on the one hand. But then its author, the Leader of the Opposition, goes on to describe us as an `obsolete economy'. I do not know how you say that to the wine industry, exporting its technology back to France, or what you say to wheat growers now using satellites and on-board computers on their tractors so that they can microfertilise their crops according to the precise requirements of each individual part of each individual paddock, let alone the overall farm, or what you say to cotton producers trading around the world out of their own farmhouse offices. The bottom line is that the Leader of the Opposition misses the point altogether. When it comes to people in rural and regional Australia, they do not want to sit around drinking caffe latte and talking about technology and a knowledge economy; they want to use it, and they are using it.</DOC>

 - The Yagoona home, as with every other home in Australia, was subject to accreditation procedures between September 1999 and 31 December 2000. In that 14-month period every home was indeed inspected and a site audit conducted and a judgment made about whether or not accreditation would be given. In that process 190 homes were either closed or relocated. At the time of 31 December the Yagoona home had reached the standard required by the agency. Subsequent to that, because all homes must commit to continuous improvement, there is a continual process of visits - both support visits, which are on a time frame, a timetable, and spot checks. The review audit that was carried out with regard to Yagoona had a recommendation from the assessor that the home had in fact failed to meet the standards on two out of the four standards and, if my memory serves me correctly, they had a critical rating. I would draw your attention, as I did in a debate we had in this chamber earlier, to a state government home in Victoria, the Reg Geary home, which was in a similar circumstance. In fact, it rated four criticals. In the Victorian circumstance there was no recommendation to revoke; in the New South Wales circumstance there was a recommendation to revoke.In each case the decision is made by the agency itself, and it takes into consideration, in accordance with the legislation, a whole lot of other factors when it makes a decision of what is to be done. In both cases - that is, in the state-run Victorian home, which had four criticals, and in the Yagoona home, which had two criticals - there was a downgrade of the accreditation. In the appendix which accompanies the recommendation of the assessors there is a statement that says what will happen if there is a critical or unacceptable standard noted in a review audit. It states that it is then the task of the agency to work with the home to bring it up to standard so that it rates at least satisfactory. That is precisely the process that is gone through for every home. The agency is an independent body set up for the purpose of carrying out those inspections, and that is the process that is carried out for every home, without favour and without fear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and I acknowledge her great interest in and support for improving education standards in her electorate. This government has increased funding for all schools in the government and non-government sectors. So far, what we know about the opposition's policy is that there is a hit list to cut funding to a mixed group of schools and an intention to rewrite the formula for funding the entire non-government sector. Yesterday in a personal explanation the member for Dobell confirmed that the Labor Party intends to write the formula for the non-government school funding and clearly left open the possibility - one might be more accurate in saying `probability' - of more wide ranging cuts to non-government school funding, because the Leader of the Opposition, as we know, is so desperate to find more funds to fund his other programs that he has decided to cut non-government school funding.The entire non-government sector now knows that if the Labor Party were ever to be elected to government the funding arrangements that the whole sector has agreed to and supported after extensive consultation will be smashed by the Labor Party. None of the two million parents who send their children to non-government schools at present has any idea how much the funding for their school and support for the education of their children will be cut. They do know that there will be immediate cuts if Labor comes to government, and they know that there is a plan for further substantial medium term reductions.But that is not the end of the story, because Labor know that once the bill stripping funding from the hit list schools goes to the Senate it will require the support of the Australian Democrats, and it is quite clear that the Democrats are trying to make a number of strong demands on the Labor Party for immediate further cuts to other schools. The Democrats have made this clear in a letter that they sent to the National Council of Independent Schools in April of this year. Senator Vicki Bourne wrote to the Chief Executive Officer of the National Council of Independent Schools as follows: Removing the SES funding increases to category 1 schools affects only 61 schools, mostly in the eastern states. It was also discriminatory and inconsistent, as under this plan category 2 and 3 schools would receive their funding increases intact.So the Democrats will be demanding that the cuts be extended to categories 2 and 3. But the Democrats' criticism goes much further than this: the Beazley hit list, in their view -  - Well, you will not get your hit list through the Senate without getting the Democrats' support for it. The Beazley hit list, in their view:... does not address that most schools will be quarantined from the formula, either by having their present funding levels maintained - the no disadvantage provision - or by virtue of being a Catholic systemic school. The Democrats believe that any fair funding formula should be able to be applied consistently with variations made according to genuine need and not on the ability to do deals.Leaving aside that last insult to the Catholic system, it is plain that the Democrats believe that many of the funding-maintained schools should have their funding cut and it is plain that they believe that the entire funding system for the Catholic systemic schools should be reworked. Getting the hit list of the Leader of the Opposition through the Senate is going to be made very difficult unless the Labor Party compromises with the Democrats, and the Democrats are making very much greater demands for school cuts. So now two million parents of students at non-government schools have complete uncertainty about the impact on their school funding and their support from the very unfair and inequitable policies of the Labor Party. All they know is that, if the Labor Party were ever to get into government, the whole of non-government school funding would be thrown into the melting pot, and the Leader of the Opposition will be stripping funding from other schools as well to fund his programs.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith interjects. Suffice it to say that we know who pays for my trips - it is the Australian taxpayer. We would like to know who pays for yours. Is it the bodgie McKell Foundation? Shonky indeed! - A very interesting question! The government today is hosting the third Australia-Singapore joint ministerial committee meeting. I would just like to say that it has been a very great pleasure to have with us here in Canberra over the last two days my friend Professor Jayakumar, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Law for Singapore; BG Yeo, the Minister for Trade and Industry; and BG Teo, the Minister for Education and Second Minister for Defence.As the meetings have demonstrated, both last night and today, our two countries enjoy very strong links in defence, trade and investment. Singapore is Australia's largest trading and investment partner in South-East Asia. In 2000, our two-way trade was $9.5 billion and, at the end of last financial year, two-way investment was about $29.6 billion. Singapore is the largest source of overseas students enrolled in Australian higher education institutions and one of our largest sources of tourists. We have strong and longstanding defence links, with joint exercises and military training underpinning our relationship. So this morning my counterpart, Professor Jayakumar, and my colleagues the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Defence exchanged views -  - on a large number of issues which are of mutual interest to Australia and Singapore. It is also worth recording that we had a most productive dinner last night as well. -  - It was not paid for by the McKell Foundation. We agreed on the need for political stability and continuing economic reform in our region -  - and the great benefits of trade liberalisation. Our negotiations on a free trade agreement, a very important negotiation for Australia, are proceeding well. We aim to conclude a substantive and comprehensive agreement, providing a strong and enduring platform to expand our bilateral economic and trade relationship in both goods and services. I do not think there is a relationship which is closer in ASEAN than the relationship we have with Singapore. It is an extremely productive and extremely strong relationship, and the joint ministerial committee meeting that we have had over the last two days has demonstrated that in spades.</DOC>

 - I would refer to my earlier answer and point out the following. The assessors, who are the assessors of the agency, the independent body which carries out the assessment and accreditation processes, found that there were two out of the four standards which were critical. I then compared it with one in Victoria owned by the Victorian state government, Reg Geary House, where the assessor found that four out of four standards were critical. Despite that, the agency found, and found properly, as it is entitled to do under the act - and I will read from its findings: Following the presentation of a report on the review audit of the service - this is the Victorian state government service - consideration of submissions by the Department of Human Services, Western Health and the service, and having regard to the expiry time for the current accreditation decision, I have decided, in accordance with section 3.241 of the Accreditation Grant Principles of 1999, not to revoke the accreditation and not to vary the period of accreditation.That compares with the action that was taken in New South Wales where two out of the four standards were found to be critical, where there was a downgrading of the accreditation period, not as the decision was in Victoria where the Victorian state government was the owner and where there was no action taken at all. The whole process is an independent process and the agency makes the decision on the merits of the case. For the member for Swan to suggest otherwise is an absolute slant and a slur on the work of the agency and, quite frankly, will not be tolerated.</DOC>

In addition to the 30 per cent rebate and premium stability, which has actually seen premiums show a slight decrease in the last 12 months for the first time since records were taken, the government has been moving ahead with reform in this area. Last week I was pleased to be able to release a discussion paper on informed financial consent. The current voluntary financial consent is not working. We need to make sure that we can progress this and we listed a whole range of options from a continuation of the present system through to legislative change.Also this week we have seen most health funds start to list on the Net doctors who participate in no-gap schemes. This is a terrific step forward. Last night, for example, I checked Medibank Private's web site: there were 22 cardiac surgeons in Melbourne that you could choose from that charged no gap whatsoever. It has had a very good response. Mr Matthew Blackmore from the Consumers Health Forum described it as:... a fantastic innovation. Consumers want information about the costs of doctors and if you want to find a specialist, this is more convenient than the Yellow Pages.We have had the ACCC support it as well. One Sydney based health fund, CBHS Friendly Society, has also taken the innovative step of allowing online membership verification by GPs. All these innovations are to be commended.Of course, to be able to advertise gaps you need to have gap cover schemes. Today, around 70 per cent of all inpatient services are provided on a no-gap basis, up from 50 per cent of 12 months ago and, of course, up from zero per cent four years ago. On radio station 2GB on Thursday last week the former Labor Minister for Health Graham Richardson gave us an insight as to why gap schemes were so slow in coming. He said:Personally, as Health Minister, I wanted to do this - that is, gap cover schemes - but the Labor Party didn't like the idea. I always thought that some form of gap insurance was absolutely necessary because I just thought it would be impossible to hold people in private health insurance unless you offered it.So here we have it: in government, the Labor Party complacent, the Labor Party refusing to act on things of interest to consumers. No wonder they are embarrassed about the government talking of its success.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I am certainly aware, to answer the second part of the question, of alternative policies. I heard the Leader of the Opposition on ABC radio this morning and he announced that the Labor Party's policy - would you believe they do have a policy? - is a policy to replace the Royal Australian Navy on the Australian coast with a new system to be known as the coastguard. He was very specific. The Leader of the Opposition said that we would have, under the opposition, if they were to be elected, a coastguard the same as they have in the United States. You would have to give them credit for being ambitious. They are an ambitious opposition. Not only do the US have a shorter coastline than Australia; they have 42,000 people in their coastguard and it has a cost of $7.2 billion a year. This must be the greatest unfunded promise ever made by any opposition in Australian political history. We have a promise of a system similar to that of the US, with a cost of $7.2 billion, and presumably a bit more to account for the fact that our coastline is more -  - That would jack up interest rates a hell of a lot - 160 bucks a month just for starters -  - And in Aston to boot. I suppose, when looking at that more carefully, we might think that perhaps he did not mean a duplication of the American system. Perhaps he was simply deceiving people about what his intentions were. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition's intentions were to have a coastguard similar to that which was examined when he was the relevant minister back in the early 1980s. If you go back to that report, and you fund it in today's dollars, that is a cost of about $2 billion. So now, instead of a $7.2 billion unfunded promise, it is $2 billion. We have got it down to $2 billion. But what is interesting is that, back in the early 1980s, when the now Leader of the Opposition examined this policy, he himself was opposed to it. His reason was that it would be a waste of resources to establish a new bureaucracy to undertake a task that is being done. I presume a second reason that he was opposed to it was that behind this proposal is a proposal to take the Australian Navy out of the essential job that it does today on the Australian coast. Let us look at what the Navy did, for example, in the year 2000. They boarded over 270 foreign fishing vessels. They escorted 1,756 unlawful persons. We had 1,800 days of the Royal Australian Navy patrol boats around the Australian coast doing a job that I believe only the Navy can do. On top of that, we had 250 hours of RAAF maritime aerial surveillance. Just to mention one incident, the ADF was involved in the incident with arresting the South Tommy for illegal fishing in the last few months. On this side of the House, we say that only the Navy should do this job. On that side of the House, the Labor Party has an impractical proposal that they themselves were opposed to and for which they have not one dollar put aside to make it happen. This is the typically irresponsible lack of position from the opposition. This is a policy not even the Leader of the Opposition supported. It is just cheap populist politics, at the expense of properly protecting Australia's coastline and at the expense of the Royal Australian Navy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell very much for his excellent question. I state for the record that this government believes that honest workers and honest unionists should be able to do their job free from intimidation and thuggery. In particular, they should be free from thuggery associated with power struggles inside the union movement or inside the Australian Labor Party, such as the fight to the death now going on between the old BWIU faction and the old BLF faction inside the CFMEU - between the Moscow line communists and the Beijing line communists - for control of one of Australia's largest and most militant unions. In the Financial Review, one of these CFMEU factions accused the other of plotting violence. We had John Sutton saying:They are going to push their muscle forward. In response, we had the other faction saying:... we will be crashing the sites, and if you want a bit of biff, it is on.Both these violent factions happened to come together in Sydney yesterday on Macquarie Street. The same union that is regularly shutting down building sites because it believes that it is above the law yesterday tried to shut down the oldest parliament in this country because it believes that it is above the law. We had a union picket saying to members of the state parliament that they would not -  - They would not be admitted to the parliament unless they agreed to a union demand. This is a disgraceful attempt by this union to bring the `no picket no start' rule from the building sites into the heart of the oldest parliament in this country. I wonder how many members opposite, confronted with a parliamentary picket line, would have the guts to put their duty to the nation ahead of their loyalty to the union. There are plenty of honest Labor people who have been prepared to condemn this union violence, this union thuggery. The one person who has not been prepared to condemn it is the spineless one sitting opposite -  - The Leader of the Opposition was asked this morning on national radio about the disgraceful violence and intimidation that shut down the parliament of New South Wales yesterday, and what did this so-called leader say? He said:I am very glad that he has indicated that he is prepared to keep talking.That is the Leader of the Opposition's response to the most disgraceful attempt at intimidation that any parliament in this country has seen for some years. All he is prepared to do is say, `Let's keep talking.' As the Leader of the Opposition has more than demonstrated in this House today, he is very good at huffing and puffing but, when it comes to any hard policy, he could not make an impression on a soft cushion. When it comes to actually taking on the unions, he could not go two rounds with a revolving door, as was said of one of his predecessors.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Deakin, I can inform the House that a further perusal of the research material on this very important subject reveals that claims have been made about the importance of developing the industry and not just using it widely and efficiently. Reference was made of it in a speech by the Leader of the Opposition to the Sydney Institute. It was a great mine of error and flawed assertion. It was a rich lode - a mother lode - of misstatement and misunderstanding and obfuscation and confusion. I would that mine enemy would write a book; would that the Leader of the Opposition would make these speeches every week. On page 8 of his speech, he said: I spoke earlier of the Treasury argument that Australia does not need a home-grown information and technology sector, but in order to maintain its prosperity only needs to be a flexible user of these resources.He then went on to say:Findings of this report suggest that this argument - the report he was referring to work was Mr Marginson's report - that is, the Chifley Research Centre report - often put by Howard government ministers is wrong.In other words, the Leader of the Opposition was saying that the argument that all you had to do was to be an extensive user in order to win prosperity was wrong - that is, prosperity was denied to you unless you had a very big home-grown IT industry.Along with virtually everything else in that speech, the Leader of the Opposition's claim is open at very least to serious challenge. In rejecting his argument, I draw not on a source which is normally identified with the Liberal Party, I draw not on a source which is normally identified with the Treasury argument of economic policy, but I draw on a book by Alan Oxley called Seize the future: how Australia can prosper in the new century. For the information of honourable members, in the 1980s Alan Oxley was Australia's Ambassador to the GATT, the predecessor of the World Trade Organisation. He explained the Hawke government's economic reform to the international trade community and became the first Australian elected as chairman of the GATT. What he had to say I think it is very relevant to the debate. I quote the very succinct and neat summation of Alan Oxley's view on this part of the debate:The mistake in all of this is to consider that the measure of success of Australia in the information age is the size of its IT industry, however that is measured. The only measure that matters is to what extent Australians will adopt and use IT.I repeat:The only measure that matters is to what extent Australians will adopt and use IT.He continued:The impact of IT is to generate big savings in the way things are done. On this score Australia rates extremely well.This summation by Alan Oxley adds to the growing body of evidence. For all the speeches that the Leader of the Opposition has delivered in recent times, none misfired more, none was more flawed, none was more intellectually imprecise and none more adequately represents to the Australian community the policy paucity of the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party.The reality is that Australia has a highly sophisticated, highly educated population. It is a country which is up there with the very best in the use of information technology. There have been numerous reports from the OECD and from the International Monetary Fund that will support that proposition. The Leader of the Opposition in addressing the Sydney Institute has provided us not with a lightning indication of his grasp of the so-called knowledge nation debate but with a rich mother lode of his incapacity to understand the fundamentals that drive the modern Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I find it extraordinary that the member for Dickson would complain about a department requesting people providing employment services to do their best. That is an extraordinary comment to make. I guess if you go back to the old CES days when they were told to get people into training courses and to cycle them around and around and around, you would have something to complain about. But a system that is based on outcomes - and an outcome, for those who do not understand, is people that get jobs - is in fact a positive thing. This department and this government stand behind the Job Network and support it in ensuring that those people that are paid to provide employment services do so, and do so to the best of their ability. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. I was recently in her electorate, at the Golden Ox Restaurant in Margate, and enjoyed very much a discussion with small business owners that were there. They alerted me to the fact that the Labor Party's spokesman on small business, Mr Joel Fitzgibbon, had been there shortly before. I went looking for a report of his visit, which I found in the Northside Chronicle of 6 June 2001, as an avid reader of the Northside Chronicle. It started off by saying this:Northside business leaders were last week slugged with bottom-line jitters of national proportions.And it was not speaking of me, Mr Speaker. It was speaking of the federal opposition's small business and tourism spokesman. The report said this:Mr Fitzgibbon was questioned on issues of GST, superannuation and unfair dismissal laws. He said GST could not be reversed, he did not say that superannuation would not be increased and he said unfair dismissal laws would have to be reviewed.The government has sought to review and change the unfair dismissal laws on how many occasions? How many times have we presented legislation to the Senate that has been defeated by the Labor Party?  - Eight times. On eight occasions the Australian Labor Party have voted against changes to the unfair dismissal laws in this parliament. And they go to the northside small businesses and say, `Oh, if we ever get elected they will have to be reviewed.' It is one thing in here, when they know the trade unions are watching them, and it is another thing when they are out in the small business community.What did he say about superannuation? He did not say that superannuation would not be increased, that is for sure, because we know it is the Labor Party's policy to increase the superannuation slug that will have to be paid by small business. And when he was questioned on the issue of GST he said it could not be reversed. Well, that is false. You can reverse GST. All you have got to do is repeal GST and re-enact wholesale sales tax, and increase income tax and increase company tax and double capital gains tax, increase financial institutions duty, increase the petrol excise and take away the reduction for long haul transport. You can reverse it all. Nobody in their right mind would do it. But of course the Labor Party have been in this place pretending that they are opposed to the GST when they run around the small business community and have an entirely different story.One of the papers noted today - and I think it is probably true - that I probably show more interest in the roll-back policy than anybody else in Australia. I certainly show more interest in it than the Leader of the Opposition, that is for sure; and I show a lot more interest in it than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Let me just remind them of some of their words. On 2UE on 9 May, Kim Beazley said:I have said before and I say again there is no doubt about our commitment to roll-back.The broadcast to the nation on 11 May:Let me state clearly that a future Labor government will be committed to rolling back the Howard government's GST ...An interview with Graham Richardson on 2 June:People should not be in any shape or form confused about whether or not we will ... roll it back. Parliament House on 19 June:There will be roll-back of the GST under a Labor government. It is not an if or but, but there will be roll-back.I have never seen a group of people going to such lengths to hide from their own policy. The whole of Australia waits breathlessly to know the roll-back policy. It waits even more breathlessly to know how much income taxes are going to go up to pay for it. And yet the Labor Party runs from its policy. It has one message in here and on the northside an entirely different message. He is spreading the message that GST cannot be reversed. He knows that is what small business want to hear; they want certainty in relation to their taxation. And he is totally out of step with the Labor Party, which refuses to come clean on its own policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the knowledgeable member for his question about Australia's exports in knowledge based technology. The House would be interested to know that last year we exported over $30 billion worth of knowledge based technology out of Australia across a whole wide range of areas, including education services. The point should be made that Australia is already a knowledge nation, and that has been acknowledged by any number of international institutions, particularly the OECD. It was interesting to note that in a speech the Leader of the Opposition made recently he said:Our headline value, our headline priority, our headline commitment is to the Knowledge Nation.Thank goodness for that, because the Labor Party have gone out initially and talked down the strength of our economy. Now they are talking down the intellectual capacity of this country: they are making out that Australia is a dumb country whereas it is not a dumb country, it is a smart country - and we are already proving that.Knowledge Nation as a proposal is coming from the Australian Labor Party, which brought us Investing in the Nation - remember that program? - Community in Nation, Shaping the Nation, Creative Nation, Our Nation, and who could ever forget Working Nation? All these programs managed to do was break the nation, and they brought us 20-plus per cent interest rates, high levels of unemployment and skyrocketing inflation.It is time the Labor Party stopped talking down the intellectual capacity of Australia and started promoting it because Australia is being recognised significantly as one of the smart countries in the world. You would only have to ask one of the 140,000 overseas students that have come to study in Australia, to study and learn from the knowledge based industries in Australia, why they are coming to Australia to learn and are not going to other countries. They recognise that Australia already is a knowledge nation. Australia exports $4 billion worth of educational services from universities not just based in the capital cities but right across Australia: universities like the Charles Sturt University in Wagga, in the seat of Riverina, and in Farrer and in Calare; and the James Cook University in Townsville, in the seat of Herbert, and in Cairns, in the seat of Leichhardt. These are very important export earnings that are being generated out of a knowledge nation that we already are and that we have already established in this country. Interestingly enough, we are going to claim credit for that because, if you have a look at the statistics, in 1991, when the Leader of the Opposition was a minister in government, we earned $995 million from education exports. Last year, in the year 2000, we earned $4 billion from knowledge based exports. Those knowledge based exports go across all sorts of smart technology based industries and, as I say, we rank very highly in the world in these.An OECD report that has been released recently has indicated that the critical issue in this whole debate is that the key to benefiting from new technology, from information and communications technology, is not how much you manufacture and export; it is how you have policies to use it. And Australia is ranked number two in the world in the application and use of ICT across all our industries in making us much more competitive with the rest of the world. Where I started was with this: we already send $30 billion worth of knowledge based exports out of Australia. Australia is already a smart country. It is time that the Australian Labor Party stopped talking it down and stopped telling the Australian people that it is a dumb country.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it enables me to deal with the sequence of events and the way in which the death of Mrs Thomas was investigated. This does raise some very serious questions. Mrs Thomas was, first of all, in Westmead Hospital and was then pressured to leave and placed into Yagoona Nursing Home. She was transferred on 7 February to the Bankstown Hospital because she had a temperature and low blood pressure. Her son rang the hospital at 7.30 the next morning and was told that his mother had been transferred back to the nursing home - no treatment. Within three days, on 11 February, she was transferred back to the hospital because her condition had worsened. She never left that hospital; she died there on 15 February.The death certificate said that she died of sepsis, I think the term is, resulting from a pressure sore. For eight of those 10 days, she was in Bankstown Hospital. The thing that concerns me a great deal is that the New South Wales Department of Health, which administers the Nursing Homes Act of that state, also licenses homes. A complaint was referred to the health commission to investigate what had happened. They have referred two registered nurses and one enrolled nurse to the Nurses Registration Board for consideration of the treatment that they gave to Mrs Thomas. This has still not been dealt with, and I understand from inquiring that these inquiries can sometimes takes two to three years.The sadness of the death of Mrs Thomas raises a very important question. When she was sent to hospital by the nursing home because she needed treatment, she was returned to the nursing home only to be returned back to the hospital three days later, and she subsequently died. Why was she not given treatment in the hospital when she needed it? </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his question. I know how concerned he is for the educational standards of young people in his electorate. He is a very active and important member of the government's education committee. I am aware of proposals that will seriously impact on the ability of families in remote and rural Australia to educate their children in the way that they would wish. This government has worked to improve opportunities for families in rural and remote Australia. In our view, a society which is going to make full use of knowledge has got to give that opportunity to all Australians wherever they live. This government has improved, for example, the basic boarding allowance, the second home allowance and the distance education allowance under the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme from January this year. We have increased the discount on farm and business assets for the purposes of the youth allowance - increasing from 50 to 75 per cent. And, of course, the new school funding arrangements recognise the sharp decline in the incomes of farming families that has occurred in recent years throughout Australia.It is clear, however, that the Labor Party has no recognition of the needs of these families and no sympathy with their situation. In fact, we know that the Australian Education Union is on record as saying:It is a fact that most farmers and many self-employed professionals minimise their taxable income by means of elaborate schemes and trusts.In other words, what Labor really thinks about farmers is that they are tax dodgers, and this may be one of the factors behind the proposal that the Leader of the Opposition is now making that there should be massive cuts to the funding of boarding schools. More than half the schools on the hit list of the Leader of the Opposition are boarding schools - 30 of the 58 schools are boarding schools essential to the educational opportunities of families in remote and regional Australia. The Leader of the Opposition says that these schools have assets. They do have assets: they have boarding houses that cater for the needs of children from families in remote and rural Australia. A large proportion of the children boarding at these schools come from remote Australia. Under the Labor Party's proposals, these schools will lose up to $2,000 per student, and this will be reflected in rising school fees for families in remote Australia. These fee increases will more than wipe out all the additional assistance this government has provided through the boarding allowance to families in remote and rural Australia. The Labor Party have clearly no idea of the importance of the boarding schools to these families. They have no sympathy whatsoever with these families. The new school funding formula that they intend to put in place will not recognise the needs of families whose incomes have been cut. They intend to go back to the old unfair, iniquitous and inequitable system under which these families were disadvantaged year after year. And now we are seeing in the Senate the Labor Party discriminating against funding certainty for many small, new community schools in rural and regional Australia as well. This is the most iniquitous policy you could imagine from the Labor Party. All we know about the proposals to fund Knowledge Nation are cuts to schools. The only proposal they have put down so far to fund Knowledge Nation is to cut the funding for schools, particularly boarding schools for remote families. I am quite sure that as this year goes on the families in remote and rural Australia will let the Labor Party know what they think of Labor's proposals to diminish the opportunities for young people in remote communities. </DOC>

 - I will tell you what I do: I clean up the mess that the Labor Party made. -  - The whole point about accreditation is this: what the Labor Party did was indeed sweep it all under the carpet. You did not know about any homes or any individuals, nor did you care. You did not care because you kept it all quiet. We have introduced a system of accreditation which is totally transparent, where even you, Member for Jagajaga, can go to the Internet and get information, and where even the Leader of the Opposition can get information. The fact of the matter is that anyone who needs information can now get it. We have lifted the carpet, and what we found underneath was a mess. Indeed, if you go back through a few of those old cuts from the Labor Party, you will find that there are cuttings such as in the Age of 15 February 1995. `Most homes in substandard buildings,' says the report. You will find headlines that say `Residents fed on scraps'. You will find people who are said to have lived in residential care ghettos. This is the mess that we had to clean up, the one you left behind, the one that the mistress of misery, the member for Jagajaga, the architect of -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Through you, Mr Speaker, I might say that the mess the Labor Party left behind left individual older frail Australians -  - I am. You asked me what I am doing, and I am telling you. I am giving you an answer - I am cleaning up the mess you left behind. I am cleaning up the appalling system you left where there was not proper care given to older frail Australians. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would be delighted to re-route those remarks through you, Mr Speaker, to say that the Labor Party left behind the most appalling mess of substandard care for frail older Australians, and we had to bring in a system of accreditation to clean it up. One of the most important aspects of our new accreditation system is its transparency. Let me say that, if state hospitals were subject to the same degree of transparency, we might find some better outcomes for patients as well, particularly for older Australians, who seem to suffer age discrimination as they enter hospitals. It is not acceptable. To go precisely to the question of the Yagoona home, I told you yesterday that the assessor on a review audit at the beginning of this year found that there were two out of four standards which they rated critical. The appendix, to the back of that report, states what will happen if there is a critical or unacceptable rating. It says that the agency will work with the provider to bring that home up to scratch and to meet the standards required. If it does not, it will be subject to sanctions. At the present time the department, together with the agency, has continued to monitor, to visit, with spot checks and support visits into that home to ensure that the things that were highlighted in the report - and I would mention two: firstly, that there was not adequate hot water for the residents and that those boilers had to be fixed and, secondly, that there were not sufficient continence aids and that they were using sheets and pillow cases; that is not acceptable - have indeed been remedied.The department has put in place a plan which that home must follow. If they do not, then sanctions will be applied. I again pointed out yesterday that, in the even-handed nature of the agency, a Victorian owned government home - and I have not noticed anybody say that Mr Bracks is my first best friend, that Mr Bracks had had his department talk to the agency - that got four critical standards in fact had no action taken in terms of the downgrading of its accreditation because the agency accepted the word of the Victorian state government, just as it applies that test to every other provider which needs to bring its standards up to scratch. It is a fair, transparent, even-handed policy, and it was much needed to rectify the appalling state in which aged care was left by the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his very probing and interesting question. This week the parliament passed laws enabling the ACCC to take representative actions on behalf of small business threatened by unconscionable conduct from big business. That is the good news. The bad news is that, thanks to the opposition, the parliament did not pass laws to protect small business against big unions. What this means is that the opposition are happy to protect small business against big business but they will never protect small business against big unions, because under the notorious 60-40 rule the unions own and operate the Australian Labor Party.To put that in context, the unions have a bigger shareholding in Labor Inc. than the Murdoch family has in News Ltd. The Victorian conference, which is the supreme decision making body of the Victorian Labor Party, has 448 delegates and, of those, 238 are controlled by the 10 biggest unions, including 52 delegates controlled by the Metal Workers Union. That is the union whose state secretary thinks that the best way to help small business is to open their front door with a crowbar. I should point out that, while the Metal Workers Union has 52 delegates, the ALP members of Aston have just two delegates to the Labor Party conference.The unions own the Labor Party, and in New South Wales they are absolutely determined to operate it. The New South Wales Labor government is in crisis and the crisis is rapidly spreading to the federal opposition, because the same union bosses who control the preselections of Labor MPs in New South Wales also control the preselections of federal Labor members here in this parliament. The unions do not think they can trust Bob Carr, but they know they can count on Kim. - Today, Andrew Ferguson, the state secretary of the CFMEU, said that he was very confident that the Leader of the Opposition would support the union position on workers compensation. Why shouldn't Andrew be confident? Under the rules of Nepotism Inc., there is brother Martin and brother Laurie here -  - Mr Speaker, I was asked about the influence of registered organisations. Let us make it very clear to the parliament that the Leader of the Opposition totally supports the union bloc vote or the `ties that bind', as he called them at the ACTU conference in 1997. Thanks to the union bloc vote, every Labor member of parliament is like a prisoner on day release. They look free, but they have got the electronic bracelet on, the unions always know where they are and what they are doing, and the unions always take custody of them every night.</DOC>

Francis Sullivan was, of course, an adviser to a former Labor Party health minister - none other than former Premier Carmen Lawrence over there. I noticed in his statement that he says that Catholic Health Australia offers to take over the accreditation function. - That is right. With regard to the system of accrediting homes and ensuring that good care is to be delivered, we have partners in this exercise - we have churches, charitable organisations, community organisations, state governments and local governments - and when we look at where sanctions have to be put in place they affect all of those sectors. No one sector has not fallen below standard at some stage, but the good thing is they are working with the agency to raise their standards.I notice that ANHECA, the peak body for private providers, put out a statement today too - which is quite amazing really - suggesting that it is a bad thing that the agency has become part of the compliance process. They are actually insisting that standards be applied, and then at the end they say:If all residential aged care sector stakeholders had a say in the control and function of the Agency, then many of the current issues surrounding undue Government interference in the operations of the Agency would disappear ...I bet they would! I bet they would, because there would be no transparency and there would be no independent arbiter. The important thing about this is that the concern is for our residents. The residents are always the important people - not propping up poor providers but looking after the residents. If providers cannot measure up, then they do leave the system: 190 during the accreditation process were either closed or relocated because they could not meet the new standards. Those 11 homes that have sanctions on them are ones that are continuing to be monitored by the agency and by the department to ensure that they come up to standard, which is what the industry wants, and it is what is in the interests of residents.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. In fact, I was in his electorate recently and he took me to the Gympie Show, which is an admirable regional tourism event. At that show I announced $100,000 in funding for the Mary Valley Heritage Railway project, another example of the things that we are doing in regional Australia for tourism. I can understand the member's interest in tourism - his electorate has many tourist attractions. The Labor Party never ask any questions on tourism. In fact, they hardly ever actually talk about tourism, and when they do talk about tourism they get it wrong. On ABC radio yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition said that the travel and tourism industries are suffering because of this government's policies. As the Prime Minister always says, when the opposition claim something -  - check the facts. So I checked the facts. I went to the Bureau of Tourism Research and I got the latest statistics. The latest statistics show that domestic visitor nights increased by seven per cent, the biggest increase ever. In addition, that growth in visitor nights has resulted in a 14 per cent increase in domestic tourism expenditure, 58 per cent of which is spent in regional Australia. This growth is continuing. There is anecdotal evidence coming out of the electorate of the member for Parkes, where the Back of Bourke Exhibition Centre is. Under another program of this government - the Regional Solutions program - we have just invested $500,000 in this project, in addition to money that they have received under my department's Regional Tourism program. Even in an area as remote as Bourke, the Dubbo newspaper has quoted Mr Stuart Johnson, the Manager of the Bourke Visitor Information Centre, as saying that, in the first four months of this year, 4,100 tourists made their way to the visitors centre compared with 3,200 in the same period in 2000. That is a whopping 28 per cent increase in visitors to Bourke. This is further evidence that this government's policies are working for tourism.  We have invested $8 million in the See Australia campaign, with Ernie Dingo out there saying, `Go on, get out there, see Australia.' We have got record funding for the ATC, we have got our Regional Tourism program, we have got extra funding for roads, we have cut company tax, we have cut personal income tax and we have cut petrol excise. Tourism is thriving under the coalition government, and those sitting opposite are constantly engaged in talking down the economy and our intellectual abilities, and now tourism.I was recently in Queensland for another $8 million investment in tourism by this government: the ATE, which is the Annual Tourism Exchange put on by the federal government's ATC. It is attended by over 1,000 buyers from overseas. They come to Australia to stock up on Australian tourism package deals to go overseas and sell. And Merri Rose, the Queensland tourism minister, is busy talking down tourism. The Queensland minister for tourism has taken a leaf from the book of the Leader of the Opposition, talking down tourism in front of thousands of international buyers. In this week's state Labor government's budget they cut funding to tourism. It is so typical of Labor's hypocrisy. They say one thing in opposition and they do another thing in government.</DOC>

 - I know that the member opposite never lets facts get in the way of a good yarn, but Mr Lang, the gentleman concerned, was in fact appointed in 1997, long before I became the Minister for Aged Care, and he was appointed to that board because of his expertise in dealing with veterans and war widows. Indeed, the veterans' community makes up a very important part of aged care. As a result of recommendations from a council which advises the Department of Veterans' Affairs, I agreed that veterans would be people with special needs for the purposes of allocations of beds for this current round. I think that Mr Lang serves on that council as well. He has long experience. He is a former member of the RAAF - he served in BCOF, in the occupational forces in Japan, and is a well respected member of the veterans community. Mr Lang was appointed in 1997 and was reappointed by me in 1999, and he is carrying out his job. For me, the criteria in appointing people to the board are whether they do the job well and whether they have the credentials for the appointment. I was unaware that being a member of the Liberal Party excluded one from serving in public office. I can simply say that the board is behaving independently, as it should, and in accordance with the Corporations Law, to which it is obviously subject. If I might say one thing about Mr Mundy: I found his comments were quite interesting. His main objection was that the government appointed the directors to the company. Of course it is a government appointment, as it properly should be. We established this corporation to be an independent board. It carries out its functions in accordance with its act and in accordance with the Corporations Law in order that the welfare of individual older Australians can be looked after. The ANHECA board, as I said, put out its own press release today, which I found was quite inappropriate.I would like to add to Mr Francis Sullivan's comments. He is a member of my compliance and accreditation forum but he has not been able to come to the last few meetings, so he has not realised that we have appointed a working group to investigate the operation of the accreditation system. That is chaired by Mrs Mary Little from the advocacy group in Victoria, because I wanted it to have a consumer focus. In the initial consultations with consumers - that is, residents themselves and their families - this is what they are saying:The accreditation scheme is an unmitigated blessing. Consumers support the accreditation system for homes, seeing it as a positive initiative. They like to know that their home is being looked over by an external body and that all homes are to meet the same standards.They say that some of the providers did not give them enough information and they want more, and then they finally say:We are not just recipients; we want to be involved.They want to have a say in how care is delivered to them. That support they get from me 1,000 per cent, and that is what the board is designed to support as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for the question, and I acknowledge her great interest in defence. She is a great supporter of the base in her electorate. The Coastwatch operation which the government has in place includes a number of agencies -  Customs and fisheries - but also the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force. In recent years the government has revamped that organisation. We have had an admiral of the Royal Australian Navy running it in recent times. We have put a lot more money into it, and by all accounts it is a world standard body. Furthermore, one of the particular features of this organisation is that we integrate a number of agencies to give us an efficient delivery of services. It is performing extremely well.Not only have we undertaken major reform and put more money into it but also we are looking to the future for coastal surveillance, and one of the capabilities we are looking at purchasing is the Global Hawk, which has been out in Australia recently. That demonstrates the fact that the government does have a vision for improving this capability, and we are in that regard very much involved in leading edge technology.I am asked whether there is any alternative policy. I did say something about this yesterday and, lo and behold, up popped a policy - but, interestingly enough, not from the shadow minister for defence, who presumably would be paying for this policy, but a person known as the shadow minister for customs. This is a very interesting thing, because he said that it was a shocking thing that I should suggest, in response to the Leader of the Opposition's proposition, that we could have a US type coastguard. The shadow minister for customs got up and said, `Actually, it's wrong to look at the cost of the US Coastguard at $7.2 billion.' In fact, according to the shadow minister for customs, the Labor Party's coastguard policy would require minimum financial commitment. Doesn't that have something of a familiar ring to it? It reminded me of the free Anzac battalion. It reminded me of the free bombing range. Lastly, it reminded me of the two free subs which are at the core of the Labor Party's commitments. The next question is: is that what the rest of the Labor Party have been saying? If you go back a bit in time, the shadow minister for industry issued a press release in which he said that Labor's commitment for a coastguard would require up to 15 purpose-designed vessels. So now we have 15 free purpose-designed vessels! Earlier than that, the very person who said that it is not going to cost you was the year before saying that we are going to have 12 high-speed twin vessels of 45 metres to 60 metres and three 80-metre ships which would confine themselves to the Southern Ocean. I had that costed and that is $850 million just for the ships, let alone the cost not only for the people to service them, to man them, but for the huge new bureaucracy which the Labor Party is planning to set up as a means of somehow protecting Australia's coastline. Just for good measure, we have the shadow minister for customs, who tells us it is going to cost nothing but he has got 15 vessels; we have got the shadow minister for industry, who has got 15 vessels, and we have got the shadow minister for agriculture, who was in the House just the other day saying:A future Labor government will move quickly to improve the policing of waters under our control by setting up an Australian coastguard ... It will be provided with specialised vessels ...What we have is a policy from the Labor Party where they say to the Australian public, `It's going to be like the US coastguard,' which has got 42,000 people in it at a cost of $7.2 billion. So you can have a US style system but it will not cost you a zack. But you have got these guys going around saying that we are going to have all these new vessels. The whole thing is just a complete fraud. It is a telling point. The person who says nothing is the shadow minister for defence, because he knows that if ever they went forward with this policy, which the Leader of the Opposition himself was a few years ago opposed to, what are they going to do? They are going to cut into the Royal Australian Navy. Well, I say that the best people to have as a core part of this coastwatch facility are the Royal Australian Navy. I say that most Australians would reckon with the government: we ought to keep the Royal Australian Navy doing the great job that they are. It is patently ridiculous for the Labor Party to put up a proposal. They do not have a zack for it. They are trying to con the Australian public, and they themselves have said that it is completely impractical. It is a con and I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition get all those shadow ministers together and finally work out a policy.</DOC>

 - Dr Flett was the inaugural chairman of the accreditation board. She is also the chief executive officer of a group of homes known as Brightwater. When Dr Flett's period of office was completed, people were thankful that she had started the process and done it well. She is free to express her views as she will. People are appreciative of the work that she did initially, but I do think it was better to have a chairman who was not a provider, in order that the board could properly get around its business of compliance.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Boothby for his interest in this matter, and particularly his interest on behalf of his constituents. In just nine days time, financial institutions duty is going to be abolished. It is a tax on deposits, and its abolition will save Australians $1.2 billion a year, an average of $60 a year for every man, woman and child in Australia. It is a tax at 0.06 per cent on every bank deposit, and it is levied on financial institutions, which then pass it on to business and consumers. FID is an insidious tax because it is hidden and because it is complicated. It is levied by all state governments except Queensland. However, even in Queensland national businesses do not discount products to allow for the absence of FID. For example, you do not see a national hamburger chain discounting hamburgers in Queensland to allow for the fact that they do not pay FID in Queensland. A car manufacturer does not discount the cars that they sell in Queensland because there is no FID. That is because businesses bury this tax in their prices. At the end of the day, all Australians, including Queenslanders, end up paying for FID. For many small businesses with enormous turnover, the abolition of this tax is very significant. For example, a small supermarket with, say, eight employees, with a turnover of around $20,000 a day, will save $4,300 a year. An average newsagent with a daily turnover of $2,100 a day will save $450 a year. A service station which, as is not uncommon, has a turnover of $10,000 a day will save over $2,000 a year. A pub with poker machines that could have a turnover of $25,000 a day will save over $5,500 a year; that means cheaper beer, because it has to be passed on to consumers. Many Australians would not be aware how broadly FID is directly levied on consumers. It is a tax on salary and wage deposits, on credit card payments, on mortgage repayments, on loans, on term deposits and on hire purchase payments and it is a tax on transfers between bank accounts. However, it is not applied to social security pensions or Veterans' Affairs pensions in most jurisdictions. In some cases, financial institutions, when they are liable for FID, do not pass it on to people under the age of 18; it saves them the cost of that banking. FID is the most insidious of all bank fees because it does not discriminate between rich and poor. The Australian Bankers Association has recently announced that around five million Australians will pay no bank fees on their bank accounts. They still, however, have to pay FID on their deposits. The member for Boothby asked me about alternative views. We know that the Labor Party oppose the abolition of FID. They oppose the GST. The GST is paying for the abolition of FID. We know that the Labor Party were so concerned about bank fees during their 13 years in office that two days before the 1996 election they pledged they would do something about it in their 14th year. We know that in current banking policy of the Labor Party - in the small part of that Labor Party policy that they did not plagiarise from the banks themselves - they pledged to monitor bank fees and charges. Given that the Labor Party are so upset about bank fees today, they should be supporting the abolition of FID. They should pledge here today that they are not going to reintroduce a tax on bank deposits. They can do it right here and right now. They can pledge that they will not reintroduce a tax on every bank deposit in Australia. There is total silence. There is total silence again. The international bank ABN AMRO sent around the world a banking sector update.  - The Dutch international bank sent a report to all their clients around the world on the banking sector in Australia. They described the Labor Party's comments on banking and fees as `a foghorn that continues to drone on'. If the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to give a yes or no now, he can write it down and send it to me. Will the Labor Party abolish FID? Will they stick to abolishing FID? Will they commit today not to reintroduce any fees or charges on bank accounts for everyday Australians?  </DOC>

 - When the agency was first established, the task it had was to overcome the legacy left by the Labor Party - `Fire trap alarms on aged care homes', `Nursing home ghettos' and `Carers condemn homes for the elderly'. Guess who was the minister then, in 1994? It was none other than the member for Fremantle. When she was asked why her government did not respond to the Gregory report, which said that there was a need to put money into nursing homes to bring the stock up to scratch, she said, `We might introduce a new tax to do it.' The work that had to be done to bring it up to scratch needed a board to oversee it -  - So, when the board was put in place, its task was to put in the accreditation system, to bring buildings up to scratch and to facilitate care for older Australians who needed it. For the Leader of the Opposition to suggest that it is a politically interfered with board is outrageous. This has been publicly attested to by the board itself, which has said that it is outrageous to say that it is a politically controlled board. The people who are appointed to it carry out their responsibilities under the Aged Care Act and under the Corporations Act.  I might add that not only have we had those other inquiries to make sure that everything is working on track and in accordance with the reforms, but we had a two-year review conducted by Professor Gray. Professor Gray's final conclusions were: It is my conclusion, on completion of the Review, that the reforms have delivered substantial improvements to the aged care system. The fine-tuning undertaken to smooth the implementation of the reforms and address unanticipated anomalies has been largely successful. The accreditation board, the accreditation system and the work that the department does in the compliance region, as well as the agency, have been highly successful in lifting standards, as consumers themselves say - and they are the ones we have to listen to. They are the ones who need the care. They are the ones who have the final say. It is the accreditation agency board, which is an independent board carrying out its responsibilities quite properly, that ensures that this can happen.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. Let me affirm that we do have a policy of detention for people who arrive in Australia unlawfully and clandestinely, to ensure that they are available for processing and for removal. It is a policy to achieve that public interest outcome. It is not punitive. It is humane. We do not detain refugees. We do, however, detain people, some of whom make asylum claims. Last week 3,000 people were detained after more than 400 additional people had arrived by boat at Ashmore Reef and Christmas Island. At the moment, 1,100 of those 3,000 are people whose claims have been determined adversely to them and who are available for removal. Of those people, 676 were unauthorised boat arrivals, 327 were visitor overstayers, and 149 were unauthorised air arrivals.We endeavour to ensure that processing occurs as quickly as possible, and it is the case that 80 per cent of applicants receive a primary decision within 15 weeks. Some applicants who have strong claims and who present with documents and corroborative information do get released within as few as four weeks. There has been very considerable improvement, over time, in the amenities, facilities and services for detainees and I table a statement which I presented at the time that I responded to the Human Rights Subcommittee report, outlining the very considerable enhancement that has occurred in recent weeks. It is important that we do not detain people longer than any time needed to make effective decisions, but it is also important that we maintain the integrity of our programs.I would like to say that on these issues we are not just talking about them; we are about solving the problems that we face. Those words may have a ring to them because they were words uttered by the Leader of the Opposition. I just say that those who suggest that an inquiry would solve the problems of detention have no policy of their own and do not have any entitlement to talk about those matters.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for predictably directing the last question in this series to me. I will take a few moments to answer, because it is an important question. I accept that decent, proper and sympathetic care of the aged is an important matter for both sides of this parliament. I would also like to say that down through the years it has always been a subject that has drawn a lot of interest and coverage in the media. If the Leader of the Opposition allows himself a skerrick of candour and honesty instead of political rhetoric on this, he will of course recall the headlines in the Sunday Telegraph of 10 March 1996 - I suppose he might turn around and say that in seven days we were responsible for this headline - `Nursing homes in crisis'. That of course spoke of the 13 years during which his government was in office.Could I just go through the substance, as I understand it, of the allegations that have been made concerning the Yagoona home. Obviously there are some circumstances about that which are distressing. Whenever there is a suggestion of an avoidable death, no matter what the age of the person, that is a matter that should incite the interest of this parliament and should invite the interest of people responsible. As I understand it, the substance of the opposition's allegation is that the recommendation of the assessment team - namely, that the accreditation be cancelled - should have been implemented but was not implemented because the state manager was in some way subject to political influence because one of the members of the board of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia and, in fact, a member of a branch within the minister's electorate. That is the gravamen of the allegation. The opposition trawls names through this parliament, smears somebody merely because they happen to be a member of the Liberal Party -  - I was not aware, when the former government was in office and there were countless people appointed to boards and so forth -  - I lost count of the number of boards to which people like Rod Cameron and so forth were appointed. It was the constant refrain of those opposite that people had to be judged according to their merit. The fact that somebody is a member of a political party is not, ipso facto, a reason why that man or woman should not be on a body. Last night, the Leader of the Opposition and I shared two hours of bipartisanship at the Young Political Leaders Council, and we both spoke of the value of participative democracy and the value of political party membership. If there is one thing that we ought to be encouraging in this parliament on both sides, it is for people to join the political party of their persuasion.If you want to drive people away from political parties, if you want to drive them away from committing themselves to public service, you blackguard them under parliamentary privilege. That is in essence what the Leader of the Opposition has done. It is in essence what has been done by the member for Jagajaga. If the Leader of the Opposition has an allegation of substance, other than one member of this accreditation board sharing common membership of the same political party as the minister, let him make that allegation, let him specify it, let him prove his case; let him not rest it on smear and innuendo.I also remind the Leader of the Opposition of another fact: the decision not to accede to the recommendation about cancelling the accreditation - the act of which the opposition has complained - was not in fact carried out by Mr Lang or by the board of which Mr Lang is a member. It was in fact carried out by the state manager, who is independently authorised to make that decision. In other words, the Liberal Party member did not do the thing about which the complaint has been made. Even if you accept smear is substance, he has not even constructed a valid case. Of course anything to do with nursing homes is emotional. Anything to do with the death of a person is emotional. It is very important for all of us, when we are dealing with issues of this kind, to try to separate fact from rhetoric and to try to deal with these matters in a sympathetic fashion. There is no doubt that, when this government came to power, there was a significant deficiency of capital in the nursing home industry in Australia. The minister and I would be the last to assert that every nursing home in Australia is perfect. I am sure that there are some that are of a lesser quality than others and some that people would rather not be associated with, but we have established an accreditation system. That accreditation system has been the subject of a review carried out over a two-year period. I have utter confidence in the decency, the commitment, the integrity and the compassion of my minister in this area. I believe that my minister has done an outstanding job. She has been the subject of constant abuse from those who sit opposite. They have sought to smear her under parliamentary privilege. They have sought to damn somebody simply by an association with a political party. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you have a case based on substance and not smear, if you have got some facts to support these tawdry allegations that you make, lay them before the parliament and stop smearing decent Australian citizens under parliamentary privilege.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for that question. Unfortunately, due to mechanical trouble with his plane, the President of Indonesia was obliged to make an unscheduled stop in Darwin. I can now inform the House that he and his party, via three Royal Australian Air Force Falcons, are on their way to Canberra. I expect that they will arrive in Canberra shortly after 5.00 p.m. this afternoon.I look forward to meeting the President tomorrow. As well as our having a one-on-one meeting, he and his ministers will meet me and their ministerial counterparts in the government. This is a very important visit. It is not only symbolically important - it is certainly that - but it is also important for the contribution it will make to the ongoing relationship between our two countries. Everyone in the House knows that relations between Australia and Indonesia went through a difficult time over matters concerning East Timor. It is the desire, I know, of the government, and I am sure of the broader Australian community, to move on from those difficulties and to make certain at a political level that the strength of the relationship between our two societies is further strengthened. I would offer the view that the events surrounding East Timor, although they caused tension at a political level, did not essentially undermine the strong people-to-people links that have existed between Australia and Indonesia over a long period of time.In our discussions tomorrow, the President and I will discuss a range of issues across our broad relationship. I welcome the strong growth in the economic side of the relationship. For example, trade and investment remains very solid. Indonesia is Australia's tenth largest market for exports and Australia is ranked as Indonesia's tenth largest investor. Last year's Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum made good progress in many practical areas, and I will be discussing some of these with President Wahid, including our desire for continued and, if possible, increased cooperation in the very difficult area of people-smuggling.We respect and support, and will continue to advocate in international fora, the territorial integrity of the Republic of Indonesia and will continue to express our hope that secessionist tensions can be resolved, including through autonomy provisions. We welcome the transition to democracy which has been undertaken in Indonesia in recent years. It is a very large country and it is a very important neighbour of Australia. I cannot emphasis too much the significance, both symbolically and otherwise, of the visit. It is the first visit to the national capital for 29 years by a serving Indonesian president. It is the first visit to Australia since 1975 - the last being by President Suharto to Townsville in 1975. For those and many other reasons, it is a very important moment in the foreign relations of this country. When the President arrives in the national capital this afternoon, he will be very warmly welcomed on behalf of all the Australian people. Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - For starters, the government has no truck with anyone that puts anybody into a phoney job, a ghosting job or any other term that you wish to use. The government is providing employment services to Australia's unemployed to get the best person into the job that they can. As far as using labour hire companies is concerned, the government has no problem with companies using labour hire companies whereby the employment is for real jobs. As you are aware, and as I made the House aware last week, there is an inquiry under way currently in relation to these matters and I intend to make a statement as soon as the interim report is available.As far as my own knowledge of these matters is concerned, the department became aware that there were some irregularities in regard to an organisation and commenced inquiries prior to Senate estimates. My own knowledge of this matter became clear at Senate estimates.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his ongoing interest in the way in which Australia has embraced information technology and the way in which, through the use of information technology, as distinct from the manufacture of those things that contribute to it, this country has been able to boost its economic performance and to lift its productivity. Recently - in fact, a few hours ago - the National Office for the Information Economy released a survey called `The current state of play: June 2001'. That report revealed a number of interesting pieces of information that demonstrate that Australia is up there with the best in relation to the use of information and computer technology. It revealed, for example, that 65 per cent of Australians aged 16 and over have access to the Internet, placing Australia in sixth place out of the 20 developed countries and putting Australia, I understand, ahead of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Japan, and that almost seven million adults - that is, 50 per cent of Australians - had used the Internet in the year to November 2000. This was a staggering 61 per cent increase over a period of two years. The proportion of adults in regional and rural Australia who use the Internet has grown strongly from 25 per cent in November 1998 to 44 per cent only two years later in November 2000. The report found that there was strong growth in Internet usage across all age groups and across all income groups and that, as at June 2000, an estimated 56 per cent of employing businesses were connected to the Internet, and this was a staggering 93 per cent increase over a two-year period. The report also cites Economist Intelligence Unit research which found that Australia was ranked second behind the United States in terms of providing an environment conducive for the development of e-business opportunities. The EIU determined that Australia's regulatory regime geared to e-business was a critical factor in its second place ranking out of 60 countries - second only to the United States in a ranking of 60 countries in the study. This is further evidence of how wrong it is of the Leader of the Opposition to talk down the knowledge base of the Australian economy. It reminds us yet again that the opposition leader, having failed to talk down the strength of the Australian economy, has now turned his negative rhetoric to the intelligence base and information base and the capacity and adaptability of the men and women of Australia in relation to information and computer technology. Just as he failed in relation to the economy generally, so he will fail in his latest attempt to talk down the achievements and the adaptability of the people of this country.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the meeting you refer to, and yes, I was present. At that meeting, a departmental person did indicate to the meeting that there were a number of job placement payments which had to be retracted. This was as a result of a survey they conducted of 963 placements showing that 61 debts were raised, meaning that a Job Network member was required to repay their placement fee. Only 17 debts related to job seekers working for fewer than 15 hours. The need for a Job Network member to make a repayment does not imply fraudulent activity, as you are suggesting. Indeed, all 61 debts were overpayments which came about for a variety of reasons, such as where an employer agreed to a job seeker taking on more than 15 hours and then did not require them for 15 hours so a payment had to be made back, or where a job seeker found their own employment. More than half of those payments identified - 32 payments - related to Employment National. We will continue to raise these issues to improve that, but are you seriously suggesting that the Commonwealth's own agency is trying to rort the Commonwealth? I might add that I believe that Employment National has that question in hand. Let me emphasise that the September and November random audits have not identified a single overpayment as a result of fraud, and all debts are in the process of being recovered. However, this flies in the face of the old CES. Let us talk about what happened there and talk about fraudulent claims. An office in a town of about 4,000 - one office in a town of 4,000 people - recorded 1,000 referrals and placements to a particular employer on the last day of the month each month in order to increase the referral and placement statistics. Another office that operated with four staff created so many phoney registrations and referrals under the Labor Party CES that the staffing formula indicated that 35 staff would have been needed. - On another occasion, in an office which was not referring the appropriate number of disabled job seekers, the problem was easily solved under the Labor Party's CES by classifying every person with spectacles as disabled. Is that the sort of behaviour that the member for Dickson considers to be appropriate? When an office did not have enough people who were of non-English speaking background, anyone without an Anglo-Celtic name was referred also, because they probably could not speak English as well.  - The connection is simple. It is that, under the Labor Party CES, CESs were actually granted more staff as a result of referrals regardless of how spurious they may have been. The Labor Party provided on outcomes which were a training program; under the coalition, outcomes are jobs. This government pays for people to get into work. It does not support under any circumstances anyone being paid for a position, a job, which is not a real job, which is a phoney job. Any such cases are investigated in full.  - I was.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I have seen claims that the economy is experiencing booming exports, strong retail trade and very strong motor vehicle registrations, because I have been reading political advertising. In fact, I read some in the Weekend Australian on Saturday, and I was about to ring up my office to ask which of the Commonwealth government ads it was when I realised it had been placed by Premier Steve Bracks, boasting about all of the new investment in Victoria and then finishing off by saying:Victoria's exports are booming ... Retail trade turnover is 11.2% up ... Motor vehicle registrations are up 16.2% ... dwelling approvals represented 31% of the national total. And all that in an economy which has been king-hit by the GST, I thought to myself. What an extraordinary thing. The federal Labor Party has been running around a'wishin' an' a'hopin' an' a'thinkin' an' a'prayin' for a recession, it has been telling us that the GST has been king-hitting the economy, and the Victorian Labor Party is boasting about how strong it is. When I was younger, I used to watch a lot of westerns. At this point, an old Indian would always look up at the US cavalry and say, `Me think he speaks with a forked tongue.' Methinks the Labor Party speaks with a forked tongue on these issues. If you listen to the federal Labor Party, it is, `Oh, the economy is awful.' But the Victorian Labor Party are taking out ads boasting about how it is booming. Who is right - federal Labor or state-run Labor? As it turns out, both are wrong, because the economy is strong, but it has precious little to do with any of the initiatives of the Bracks state Labor government. The ad says: Victoria's exports are booming ... One of the reasons Victoria's exports are booming is that we took $3½ billion worth of taxes off the exports of this country. That was something that was opposed by the Labor Party right to the bitter end, even though the Manager of Opposition Business conceded on 12 January 2000 that the GST overall should be good for exports. What about retail trade? What has the Victorian government done to encourage booming retail trade? Well, I can tell you that one of the things that has encouraged booming retail trade is the fact that every Australian income tax payer got an income tax cut on 1 July last year and now has more money to spend. That has been very good for retail trade. But of course the Labor Party opposed income tax reductions. And what about motor vehicle registrations, which are up 16.2 per cent in Victoria alone? Well, the biggest thing you could do for the motor vehicle industry in this country was to cut the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on every vehicle, introduce a 10 per cent GST and wipe out taxation altogether for any business that buys a motor vehicle. From budget night in May this year, no business that buys a vehicle will pay any tax whatsoever - a reduction of 22 per cent in the tax on the wholesale value of that particular motor vehicle. The truth of the matter, as the Victorian Labor government says, is that the Australian economy is strong - and it is stronger because of tax reform. The falsity is in the hands of the federal Labor Party. It has done everything it could to try to talk down the Australian economy, and its only regret is that it has been unsuccessful.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition. You have already asked me the question; I have given you the answer. - What is quite clear is that -  - Quite clearly, as I said, the department became aware of irregularities regarding some use of labour hire companies prior to Senate estimates questions that raised these issues, and the time I became aware of those specific allegations was in fact at the Senate estimates. However, I will tell the Leader of the Opposition: there was no reference at the meeting on 1 June to labour hire companies. It was about the general point that repayments had been made back to employment agencies where it had been deemed that there was a necessity for a repayment. The department was working particularly with the Commonwealth's area of Employment National to improve that situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question, because it does give me an opportunity to put this issue into some context. First, let me repeat what I have said in a number of places recently. Australia does not detain refugees, but we do detain people who arrive, undocumented, unlawfully, in Australia in order for us to be able to process and remove from Australia people who have no lawful entitlement to be here. The fact is that a year ago 4,100 people arrived by boat. This year, about 4,000 people have come already. I noticed that some people were fairly critical of me when I said that as many as 10,000 people could be packing up their bags -  - Yes. And almost 9,000 are here now. That is the point, isn't it? But, on top of that, we have 7,000 onshore claims from people who arrived lawfully and who seek to test claims as well. The government have acted to reduce processing times for people in detention, with extra resourcing and streamlined procedures. People with documentation - let me make this point very clearly - with strong claims, are being released in as little as four weeks after arrival. In other words, if they are refugees who are able to establish clearly who they are, where they are from, what the nature of those claims is and to have them tested, people can be out in as little as four weeks. Eighty per cent of applicants get a primary decision within 15 weeks - that is, within 15 weeks, 80 per cent are advised whether or not they are accepted as refugees. The real delays -  and people do cite cases of people who are held for two or three years - occur when people who have manifestly unfounded claims or no claims at all wish to pursue their case before our courts to test whether or not they have a basis to be here, or often simply to delay the inevitable and to be able to argue, `It's unreasonable to remove me because I've been here for so long.' Currently in detention there are 153 people who are either involved or were involved in litigation over protection visa applications, and there is  a wider group of people who are involved in other matters before the AAT or in relation to security questions where those issues are being tested as well. The fact of the matter is that people are using every avenue available to them. That is where the delays are. Primary decisions are taken very quickly. The Refugee Review Tribunal has given priority to decisions in this area. If somebody goes before the Federal Court, before a single judge, on average it takes 222 days. If they appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court, the average is 165 days. So, in combination, it takes more than a year, and that is before they even try the High Court - and something in the order of 70 immigration matters are now before the High Court.What does the opposition have to say about these matters? The opposition says, `Speed up the system.' The shadow minister said, `The reality is the system can be quickened up. I think it needs to be streamlined.' He said that on the Sunday Sunrise program on Sunday. He got even more specific when he said, `We can speed up the process. Let's look at it and see if we can speed up the court system.' Well, the Attorney has been liaising with the court over those matters, to ensure that they are dealt with expeditiously.Let me just say where the real delay is. The real delay is where people are able to abuse the legal system. The Labor Party think it is good enough to remove casino decisions from the purview of the courts for examination in New South Wales. They have approved privative clauses elsewhere, but in the next fortnight in the Senate we will, I suspect, see them again oppose the introduction of a privative clause which would ensure that people had access to appeal but did not have access to unreasonable opportunities to exploit our judicial review system when they are non-citizens and have no entitlement to be able to access that system to delay decisions in relation to their presence here in Australia.The fact of the matter is that the opposition can be part of the solution in these matters. They should not be out there baying that this is a problem that has to be dealt with. They can be part of the solution. They do not have to be part of the problem. All they have to do is support the reform of the system and we will have a much more expeditious system. We will have those people available for removal and then we will be able to set about ensuring that they do go home.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson. I do not recall any such conversation with Leonie Green. Let me make amply clear what the government's policy is in relation to putting people into labour hire companies. The jobs filled by job matching providers must meet a threshold of 15 hours over five working days, for a payment to be made. The government has no issue whatsoever with labour hire companies being utilised by Job Network members in order to do that. We are aware that Job Network members in some cases outsource to such companies and in some cases own them. What we are interested in and will continue to be interested in is ensuring that real employment is offered in all cases. As the member for Dickson is aware, the situation involving Leonie Green is under investigation by the department. I have asked them to expedite that inquiry and I am expecting to be able to have an interim report this week. It will take some time longer than that for the complete inquiry to be formalised, but it is my intention to ensure that the Job Network is in fact protected from the slander that has been coming from those opposite, and the innuendo that malpractices are in fact widespread, and to ensure that the integrity of the service -  - In conclusion, the Job Network is providing twice the job applications of the old CES, at half the price of the CES. What we are seeing here is the unemployment policy, not the employment policy, of the Labor Party being enunciated.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler, who displays a keen interest in quarantine defence issues. It is perhaps not widely known that the port of Bundaberg, in the honourable member's electorate, is actually one of the busiest small craft arrival ports in Australia. It is a place where quarantine and customs officers work cooperatively together to ensure there is an appropriate quarantine barrier. Many Queensland members have expressed concern about the need to upgrade Australia's quarantine services and to ensure that we have an effective barrier against disease in our country. With the honourable member for Leichhardt, I visited Cairns airport a week or two ago, where initial work is being done to achieve the government's new objective of 100 per cent inspection of passengers on arrival and 100 per cent inspection of cargo coming into this country. In Cairns, new staff are already being recruited to help achieve this objective for both customs and quarantine, three new X-ray machines are under order and there is an extra dog team being trained. This is a vital national initiative, absolutely essential to protect our country's clean and green  image.The honourable member asked whether there were any risks to this magnificent $600 million investment by this government in quarantine. There is an alternative policy and that is one of the pet projects of the Leader of the Opposition - the coastguard. We have been hearing quite a bit about the coastguard over recent times, the so-called free coastguard that the shadow minister for defence often refers to. But we learnt over the weekend that in fact the coastguard is a major threat to the government's investment in quarantine expenditure, because the honourable member for Bowman let the cat out of the bag as to how the coastguard is actually going to be funded under the Labor government. The pet project of the Leader of the Opposition is, as I understand it, supposed to be modelled on the US Coast Guard, which costs about $7.2 billion a year and employs 42,000 people.  - If you decry that, are you aware that it has about the same size land area as Australia? I think the US actually has a smaller coastline, and so it might even cost more to run a coastguard in Australia than it does to run one in the US. We were finally told yesterday on Sunday Sunrise by the member for Bowman, the shadow minister for immigration, how this coastguard was going to be paid for. I think this has already been referred to by the minister for immigration. According to the member for Bowman, Labor would pay for a coastguard by using funds from other services, including quarantine and customs. He said, `There are fisheries, quarantine, customs and there is a lot of money being spent. We are talking about possibly pooling these funds to get a coastguard.' So that is the fact: they will roll back quarantine expenditure, roll back all the effort in relation to customs and increase fees for fishermen so that the rival navy and air force being proposed by the Leader of the Opposition can be funded.So this is where coastguard is coming from: a wind back, a roll-back, of our effort to upgrade Australia's defences at the border - the $600 million expenditure on ensuring a 100 per cent inspection of passengers' luggage, a 100 per cent inspection of cargo, a 100 per cent inspection of mail. All of that sort of thing is at risk because the Leader of the Opposition wants to set up a rival air force, army and navy so that a $2 billion coastguard can be established around the country, destroying the cooperation between the various services - the police, the Air Force and Navy - that exists at the present time. He wants to destroy all that and wind down the quarantine effort so that he can set up this rival army and air force - that is, coastguard. That is a threat now to the quarantine effort that this government is putting in place that has been so warmly welcomed by the rural industries of Australia and, indeed, by the whole nation. We know our disease-free status and our clean and green image is vital to our nation. The opposition leader wants to trade this off for a McHale's navy.</DOC>

 - I would be only too happy to answer the Leader of the Opposition's question. I will check the details with my office. I think I was sworn in only on 14 February, but you probably know that better than I. There is nothing here whatsoever to hide, because the fact is that the Job Network has been working well.While we are on the Job Network and the 15 hours issue, I should explain why 15 hours has been chosen. It seems to be raising so many questions. The member for Dickson on television on Friday night said that 15 hours is not a real job. Well, under the CES, two hours was a real job - for example, unloading the truck was enough. Do anything for three hours and that was enough, and then the CES would get a payment in the form of additional staff.  -  What checks and balances were there under the Labor Party? None at all. - But because we pay on performance -  - we ensure that the people -  - who are receiving Commonwealth payments are doing so thoroughly and properly.</DOC>

 - The Australian Defence Force is an absolutely integral part of the protection of Australia's coastline and an integral part of the very highest priority that this government gives to quarantine issues. If I was asked to nominate some of the best things that the Howard government has done, I believe history will show that the work we have put into Coastwatch and the additional funding and the resources applied to the quarantine task were not only justified but thoroughly in the national interest. Within that system, none does a better job than the Royal Australian Navy. I believe that we ought to keep the Royal Australian Navy undertaking the tasks that it does. We have not only the Royal Australian Navy but the Royal Australian Air Force with the Orions which play, again, a vital role in protecting this country against the incursions of diseases or pests which could literally decimate the great agricultural industries that underpin so much of our living standards.I join with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in expressing real concern about the hotchpotch of policy that we get from the Labor Party on this issue. To my knowledge there are something in the order of six different policies from the Labor Party on this vital issue, all of which lead to a downgrading of the Royal Australian Navy's work on the Australian coastline and of the vital work of the Royal Australian Air Force. The shadow minister for industry in February last year was going to give us 15 purpose-designed vessels. Then the shadow customs spokesman was going to give us not 15 but 12, plus another description of ships. The shadow fisheries spokesman just two weeks ago said that we would have specialised vessels. That proposition was costed at about $850 million. The shadow minister for justice then popped his head up again and said that it was not actually going to cost us anything; so now we have a free coastguard from the Labor Party. Now we have Conroy candour in the lower house - his opposite number. I think it is fair to say that Senator Conroy is a person of discretion and of judgment and a person who understands the basic mechanics of putting together a federal budget. I say that, on this occasion - the words may come back to haunt me - Senator Conroy was prepared to speak the truth. It seems that, faced with a proposal for which there is no money, the member for Bowman thought that he would let a bit of Conroy candour out into the media. He said, `Well, there is a lot of money being spent. We're talking about possibly pooling some of those funds, taking them from each of those places and being able to get, if you like, a coastguard.' In other words, strip down what we are already doing in Coastwatch to set up, should I say to my colleague, not a pretend Navy or Royal Air Force but, in fact, an army of bureaucrats. I say that based on none other than the report which the Leader of the Opposition signed off in the 1980s when he said this was not a good idea, in today's dollars it would cost $2 billion and it would not be more effective -  in fact would be less effective than the then system prevailing, which we, of course, have significantly enhanced.This policy from the Labor Party is a disaster. It puts second the national interest. The Labor Party is putting it up, and it has got six different positions, all as part of some sort of fraud on the Australian public as to what it is going to do. The fact is you do not have a buck to do this. It is not a good idea. You yourself have been opposed to it. As I suggested to you last week, you ought to get all of your shadows - there are five or six of you now - together and actually finally put this whole policy in the wastepaper bin, where it belongs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He and all members on this side would take as much pleasure as I do in the improvement in the service levels for his constituents and all Australian telecommunications consumers. We have an objective, arms-length assessment - indeed, proof - of that by way of the March quarter survey of the Australian Communications Authority into the consumer service guarantee framework that the government introduced in 1998. What that survey has found is that Optus had the best national performance, at 96.5 per cent, for connecting new services within the new and tougher consumer service guarantee time frames. Telstra was at 90 per cent. Telstra's performance in connecting new and in-place services has remained strong. For new infrastructure in major rural areas, compliance is 84 per cent, a substantial improvement over the previous - December - quarter when compliance was 75 per cent. And Telstra's performance in meeting the consumer service guarantee standard time frames for fault rectification stands at 85 per cent, up from 81 per cent in the December quarter.But, believe it or not, there is somebody who, in the face of this objective survey by an independent body charged with furthering the interests of consumers, contests that. It is none other than the member for Perth, who claimed on the AM radio program this morning:On anyone's estimate, whether it is the Besley inquiry, whether it is the Australian Communications Authority, service levels by Telstra in outer metropolitan, rural and regional and remote Australia are inadequate.How does that tally with the Australian Communications Authority's survey showing that service levels are increasing? The member for Perth himself has issued press releases at different times in the past congratulating the carriers for this improved level of service. So the member for Perth knows that his statement was false on the AM program this morning, and not only in regard to the ACA. The Besley inquiry found that Australians generally receive adequate phone services, and it is in rural and remote areas where services are not adequate. The government is addressing that.The member for Perth was able to con his way on to AM, which is supposed to be the flagship radio current affairs program of the ABC. He was invited on the strength of this attack on the government because of some internal memo within Telstra which has no management endorsement and is not part of any business plan. Doesn't it occur to the producers of the AM program and those other journalists who ran his story - as is par for the course when he puts out something on a Sunday; it invariably gets picked up and he backs away - why there is no question in this House? And there will not be a question in this House. Yet he gets a national audience. He has once again slimed his way into the media consciousness. He has got a track record on this. He verbals people left, right and centre. He will say anything at the time just to gain some media attention. He never substantiates it; he never follows through. For instance, he said on 5 March this year by way of a press release, so it was not a mistaken comment: That is why the Prime Minister could say last week that he and the government regard the full privatisation as a certainty.The Prime Minister has never said that. There is no transcript, there is no statement, and you have put in quotes as if it is the Prime Minister's own quote. Another verballing. This time he amends his own transcript; he doctors his own words. According to an ABC web site, when asked on AM -  AM again -  - Doctored, falsified, rewritten - what does it matter? It is the same thing. - According to the ABC transcript of his interview on AM on 22 March last year, when asked to substantiate his attacks on the integrity of the independent telecommunications service inquiry, the Besley inquiry - and remember his very personal attacks on the integrity of the Besley inquiry - he said, `That's not the point.' In other words, he backed off. When asked to substantiate his claim, he says, `That's not the point.' But when the transcript appeared on the ALP web site on 6 March, he says, `Well, that's the point.' So he is brave with the ALP transcript -  -  - Exactly. If some of those journalists who are so easily fooled or beguiled by the member for Perth want to come along to either Senator Alston or me, we will give them chapter and verse on his long history of complete misrepresentation. We have got the ABC lies, the Besley lies, the GST lies, the Telstra service lies, the Telstra pricing lies, the mobile phone tower lies - it goes on and on. - The member for Perth thinks it is clever politics to misrepresent in this way, but it is all part of the public's perception that the opposition is policy lazy and will do anything to get its way into government. Opposition members - Lies! - The lies being told are by the opposition about telecommunications services. So the dimmer of the glimmer twins has struck back. He is a masked deceiver -   - I challenge the member for Perth to ask a question on the press release he put out yesterday and on his media interviews today. He received some coverage in most newspapers, so it says something about the member for Perth or it says something about political media coverage in this country that the member for Perth can regularly and in an uncritical manner be represented in the media. Ask your question if you believe what you said earlier on.</DOC>

Is that what we are to take by the Leader of the Opposition questioning that public servants are going to not provide honest advice to the government of the day? The fact is that this will be a full and thorough investigation. I have given a commitment to this House that I will return to this House - presuming that we are able to do so before the House rises this week - with an interim report and then provide a full report, because the integrity of the Job Network and the services that are provided at half the cost and with 16 per cent better outcomes than the old CES -  - is something that this government is very proud of. It is something that is doing a lot for the unemployed of this country, and we stand by it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question - there is no doubting her commitment to addressing the awful problem of domestic violence in this country. The Howard government places a high priority on addressing domestic violence. This is not a private matter; it is a serious issue for our whole society. Domestic violence affects about a quarter of women in relationships. It affects their children, their work and their health. It leaves wounds that can take generations to heal.The profound effect that domestic violence has on all aspects of our society led the Prime Minister to convene a national domestic violence summit in 1997. At the Prime Minister's summit, heads of government agreed to work together in Partnerships against Domestic Violence, a strategic collaboration aimed at more effective prevention of domestic violence. The Commonwealth underpinned this initiative with funding of more than $25 million over 3½ years to June this year, and a further $25 million was provided in the 1999-2000 budget to June 2003.Over the first 3½ years, the partnerships initiative has funded over 130 diverse and often innovative projects to find the best ways to identify, intervene in and prevent domestic violence. Resource material has been prepared for use by everyone from victims to service providers to government agencies. The partnerships initiative has determined the best ways to intervene to prevent domestic violence - how to help women cope and survive and how to help the perpetrators change their behaviour. It has also highlighted and made visible the particular concerns of vulnerable groups in the community, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, culturally and linguistically diverse communities, older women and women with disabilities. But we are not stopping there. Over the next three years, the second phase of the partnerships initiative will be implemented. This will include development of a national community awareness campaign to break the intergenerational cycle of violence. We will fund the Australian Domestic and Family Violence Clearing House, look at early intervention projects to improve the wellbeing of children affected by domestic violence and develop programs for perpetrators. We will also fund the second tranche of the National Indigenous Family Violence Grants Program to assist indigenous community based organisations to develop local solutions to family violence.To assist indigenous communities, the Commonwealth and ATSIC have jointly developed a national strategy focusing on better targeting of existing resources to support community driven initiatives and of improved coordination of programs and policies at all levels of government. In April this year we hosted a national forum on indigenous family relationships which was attended by over 400 indigenous community leaders and service providers. At the forum we launched the Commonwealth funded `Walking into doors' campaign to bring domestic violence out into the open. At the same time, ATSIC has this year committed $3.9 million for its national family violence legal prevention program.Just last week, the Deputy Prime Minister launched a booklet providing information to people in rural and regional areas about family violence programs near where they live. In my own portfolio, the National Crime Prevention Program has domestic violence as a key priority. In the first phase we have produced a major research report on programs for perpetrators. In the past year the program has focused more strongly on issues relating to sexual violence, violence in indigenous communities, older people and fear of crime, evaluation and early intervention. In dealing with domestic violence, it is clear that we cannot ignore it - it must not be kept behind closed doors. If we are all committed to recognising and addressing this insidious social problem, we will all help make our communities more secure places to live in and our families safer.</DOC>

 - In the course of this year, since the first accreditation period was completed, there have been in excess of 1,300 spot checks conducted across Australia as part of our monitoring system and visiting system of residential aged care homes. In addition to that, there have been support visits and visits by the RCS nurses, who go to monitor the care plans to ensure that the care delineated in the care plan, against which the subsidy is paid, is in effect being delivered.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. I am aware of very misleading statements being circulated in Queensland, first of all by the Queensland Teachers Union and then by the Beattie government itself, to promote the election of a Beazley Labor government. This is a campaign based on disinformation. It is a campaign that is squandering the funds of union members in Queensland, conducted by a union which has long been opposed to all funding for non-government schools. The Australian Education Union submission to the Senate inquiry last year said: The Australian Education Union has long opposed any funding to private schools, and will continue to do so.And when the Secretary of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, Sue Simpson, was asked, `Do you want the government to stop funding private schools in all shapes and forms?' she replied:That is certainly the ideal position of the Teachers Federation.They are keen to promote this campaign of disinformation because they know that a Beazley Labor Party government will be cutting funding to non-government schools. They have already established their hit list of 58 schools. They have already indicated that they intend to rewrite the formula. They have already indicated that they intend to introduce a new schools policy to reduce funding to non-government schools. This campaign by the Queensland Teachers Union is nothing more than a shallow, dishonest political campaign designed to support the Labor Party. The only definite policy for funding in relation to Queensland schools at the moment from the Leader of the Opposition is a proposal to cut $3,000 per student from a community school on the Darling Downs.This disinformation campaign is continuing also with the support of the Beattie government. I noticed that in the recent budget the Beattie government was busy promoting the money that it was putting into quality teacher training. It announced that $3.7 million will be spent on developing the quality teacher program, which aims to improve and update the skills of teachers. Every single dollar of that $3.7 million to improve quality teaching in Queensland is Commonwealth money. Every single dollar comes from the Commonwealth, yet the Beattie government is claiming that it is its own funding. It is trying to mislead Queenslanders that, somehow or other, money going into quality teaching in Queensland is coming from the Queensland Labor government and not from the Commonwealth government.Commonwealth funding for government schools in Queensland is at an all-time high - some $440 million going into government schools in Queensland from the Howard government. We are promoting quality education for all young Australians; the Queensland Labor Party and the unions which support it - the Queensland Teachers Union - are out there trying to mislead, dishonestly, the parents of Queensland.</DOC>

 - Spot checks are conducted as unannounced visits, with the officers seeking immediate access to the home. In a very small number of cases there can be less than 30 minutes notice given to remote country areas or urban fringe areas. The spot checks are conducted both by the agency and by the department. In the case of the Yagoona home, I know that some of those visits were conducted by the department, which conducted them in the way that I have just described.</DOC>

 - You have got a few. - He wants investment advice. I can't give that. - How ironic: they oppose it, and then they buy them! - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. The good news is that in just five days time stamp duty on the transfer of shares will be abolished. This is an unfair tax. It is a tax on individuals who saved to invest in wealth creation - I know the member for Paterson would be interested in that - and it is a tax on self-funded retirees who rely on their investments for their quality of life. It is a tax on investments and jobs, because it has made Australia an expensive place to buy and sell shares. When our stock market represents just two per cent of the world's stock market, every dollar counts, and our competitiveness in the past has been affected by this tax. In five days time this is going to change.The tax will remain in the United Kingdom, in the United States, in Singapore, in Hong Kong and in Switzerland. However, from 1 July it is abolished in Australia. This is good news for Australia's eight million shareholders. Australia is, under the Howard government, the largest share owning nation in the world: 52 per cent of our population owns shares, either directly or indirectly. In fact, 48 per cent of people directly owning shares in Australia earn less than $60,000 a year. Every Australian who has superannuation pays this tax.Professor Peter Swan from the University of Sydney has conducted a study into stamp duty. In that study he found that the elimination of stamp duty will increase turnover by up to 50 per cent on the Australian stock market. He has also found that the other transaction costs, including the costs of share trading, should fall as a result of the abolition of this tax. In fact, the estimates from Professor Swan indicate that the total value of the Australian Stock Exchange should increase by around $50 billion as a result of the abolition of this tax. When the tax was halved by the Queensland government in 1995, investor wellbeing rose massively and immediately. Within three hours of the announcement nearly 1.8 per cent - about $4 billion - was added to the value of the All Ordinaries Index.I have been asked by the member for Pearce about alternative policies. I had a look at the Labor Party's corporate governance policy, and in it the Leader of the Opposition refers to the fact that 5.7 million Australian adults now directly own shares - 40 per cent of the Australian population. It is actually 52 per cent now. In it he said that in 1991 it was just 10 per cent of the Australian population. That is exactly right. As a result of the initiatives of this government, we have halving of capital gains tax, we have reductions in income tax and now we have the abolition of stamp duty on the transfer of shares. If the Labor Party is serious about creating wealth for individuals, if it is serious about -  -  - It is hard to believe, but if the Labor Party is serious then the Leader of the Opposition can, right here and now, rule out that, under a Beazley government, he will reintroduce this tax. - He can put it in writing, Mr Speaker. I am happy to accept it in writing. If the Leader of the Opposition truly believes in the interests of the Australian people, if he truly believes in share ownership by Australians, then right here and right now - in writing if he pleases - he can rule out reimposing stamp duty on the transfer of shares. You cannot trust Labor. As soon as they have an opportunity - if they ever get an opportunity - to reintroduce a tax on shares they will do it. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and indicate that the government is delighted to examine very thoroughly, through the Strategic Investment Coordinator and that process which has been so beneficial for investment and jobs in this country, any project that is good for Australia. The project that the honourable member referred to on Christmas Island went through a vigorous evaluation under that process before ultimately being brought to government for further consideration. It provides an opportunity that places Australia in a very good position in this area of technology, it provides a significant number of jobs that will go to Australians and it provides an opportunity for that particular territory of Australia, Christmas Island, to get an industry when it has been in the past struggling significantly, particularly since the casino was closed down a few years ago.The honourable member would be aware of a contingency reserve which contains numerous amounts of money of a broad and general nature for areas that require support, and there is always such a need. If one follows the argument of the member for Melbourne, one would simply say that government ceases the night of the budget and does absolutely nothing else until a further appropriation bill goes through, either at additional estimates time or the following year. Government and administration of this nation is a movable thing, and there is a need to provide for contingencies, such as those proposals that are full of merit. This was a proposal full of merit, and the government is proud to stand by it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think we would all agree that the nation is in the end the sum total of the individual Australians that make it up. The relationships between us are the glue that bind us together. To the extent that those relationships work well, the community and the nation are the stronger; to the extent that they do not, the nation is the weaker.In the midst of a strong community that is in many ways doing very well, particularly economically, we are all, I think, concerned about some of the indicators that reflect relationships that are not working as well as they might, whether those things are youth homelessness, drugs, the very worrying level of youth suicide in this country or the problem of domestic violence - something I know that all members of this place would be very concerned about. The booklet I have here, which generated quite a bit of interest last week, tells the story of 17 communities across Australia where people are trying at a local level to break a cycle of violence, particularly domestic violence, including in Aboriginal communities. There is much that governments can do. That would include, for example and very importantly, sound economic management. There is no doubt that keeping employment opportunities up, keeping housing mortgages down and creating an environment where people can do well economically are very important. Over and above that, there are a lot of things that governments themselves cannot do on their own but that communities can, with government help and government leadership, take forward.The government's stronger families and communities strategy - a very substantial package of around $240 million - emphasises the real commitment of the Liberal-National Party government to an investment in the bonds that underpin family and community life and, indeed, enables community groups of the sort outlined in this book to really take forward their work in coming to grips with some of the very real and the very ugly problems that some people do confront, unfortunately. There are a range of other programs that the government also runs: $6 million for community based relationship support groups; over $900 million to the states and territories to assist them in providing accommodation support, respite care and day services to people with disabilities; $60 million towards establishing youth homelessness prevention and early intervention services; and, this year, $115 million for a new alcohol education and rehabilitation foundation to address the problems of alcohol abuse, which often manifests itself in domestic violence. This week, it ought to be remembered, is Drug Action Week. The estimated cost of illicit drug abuse to the Australian community is about $1.7 billion a year. It can have, as we all know, a truly devastating impact on families. We have committed around $500 million to the Tough on Drugs strategy, which fights illicit drugs on three fronts: health, education and law enforcement.The honourable member asked about alternative proposals. You could start by pointing to the enormous damage done to families in this country by cripplingly high mortgage rates - remember all those television programs where people were unable to hang on to their homes any more? - by very high unemployment rates and by small businesses falling over. Labor consistently failed to find ways to support Australian families. We see that continued now. The Leader of the Opposition, in response to what we are doing on law enforcement, particularly in relation to drugs, claimed that progress has been `slow, patchy and uncoordinated'. If he is not talking down the economy or talking down our academic and educational achievements, he is talking down what we are doing to wind back the problem of drug abuse in this country. Labor continually paid and continue to pay inadequate attention to the underlying causes of homelessness, and they have ignored the level of need of carers and of people with disabilities.Governments cannot solve all the problems in what is happening to relationships in the community - domestic violence and those sorts of things - but strong leadership and providing communities with the tools they need to tackle these problems are very much part and parcel of the commitment of this government to the nation's families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point I would make is that there has never been a $1 billion plan. That is a bit of idle speculation that you have picked up for the most base of political purposes. When it comes to doing things for rural and regional Australia, there is an incredibly long list, all of which have been done without it being put on the national bankcard, the way you did with every initiative you undertook. We just have to take the reduction in Commonwealth debt, taxpayers' debt, if you like - governments do not have money; only taxpayers do, and when it is a debt of the sort that was run up under the Leader of the Opposition it is a taxpayers' debt. And that is what you had - $96 billion of it. It increased by $80 million in the five years that the man once described as the world's greatest Treasurer was in charge of the government that you were a part of. It blew out by $80 billion. The reduction in debt under the current government saves us around $4,000 million a year in interest alone. That sort of money has enabled us to put in place a range of very valuable programs: whether it has been around $700 million for more doctors, better services and more nurses in rural and regional areas, whether it has been $1.2 million for local roads, whether it has been $700 million for a water quality and salinity action plan, to be matched by the states, whether it has been the Regional Solutions program, or whether it has been stronger families and communities, which I have just touched on, we did not have to put the taxpayer into debt anymore to do it.</DOC>

 - Whenever he leans back and engages in exaggerated laughter, to the extent that you can see his braces, you know that he is worried about the question, and more worried about the answer. - I would cover up the braces, if I were you. Our attention was really taken by the fact that this morning when we opened up our Sydney Morning Herald we saw a foretaste of precisely what the Labor Party has in mind in relation to its so-called knowledge nation.The knowledge nation has been coming for the last five years. During the week we heard that Knowledge Nation is not just a policy; Knowledge Nation will be a 10-year program when it is announced, which is quite impressive. Stalin had only five-year programs, but the Leader of the Opposition is going to have a 10-year program in relation to his knowledge nation. But how, pray tell, would this knowledge nation be funded? A clue to that came in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, where Michelle Grattan reported that the Labor Party is considering government issued bonds. The article states:Government-issued bonds - along the lines of national war bonds - could be used to finance capital expansion of Australia's higher education and research under an idea promoted by Labor's innovation spokeswoman - that is a very innovative financing method - Dr Carmen Lawrence. She floated the proposal at a private meeting of deputy vice-chancellors ... in Brisbane last week. She stressed it was her personal plan and not Labor policy. If a budget is in surplus, a government does not issue bonds. Since this government has come to office -  - He always interjects loudest when he is at his weakest. Since this government was elected in 1996, in net terms we have not issued any bonds because we do not have to cover a deficit in our budget. Over the last six years, we have not been issuing bonds; we have been redeeming bonds, we have been buying them back. The Labor Party, in its last five years in office, first of all ran deficits and then it sold assets and could not fund its deficits. Then it went onto financial markets and issued an additional net $80 billion worth of bonds. Over the last five years of coalition budgeting, we have funded our budgets and we have redeemed in net terms $60 billion of those bonds.If your budget were in surplus, you would not need to issue a bond. A bond is a borrowing by the government. Let us get this clear: a bond is a way of a government borrowing. The only possible reason for ever issuing a bond - whether you call it a Treasury bond, an Aussie bond, an innovation bond or an education bond - would be a deficit budget. The only reason you would issue a bond is to borrow money to fund a deficit. So here we have revealed in the Sydney Morning Herald by the shadow minister for innovation a plan to issue bonds, which is a plan to run a budget deficit. There is no other reason why you would issue a bond. Dr Lawrence has said, `We'll call it an education bond rather than a Treasury bond.' It does not matter what you call it; a bond is a borrowing from the community. The article goes on:They would carry only a modest rate of interest.If anybody is going to buy a bond, they buy a bond at prevailing interest rates. Otherwise, why would they put money into this investment where they could get two per cent, when they could put it into another investment where they would get five or 10 per cent? There is no such thing as a moderate rate of interest; there is a market rate of interest. That is what a government has to pay. The first thing is that you cannot have a below market rate of interest on a government bond; you have a government rate of interest. That is the first point. The second point is that, if the government is out there borrowing savers' money, that will drive up interest rates. It cannot have any other effect. If the government is borrowing, that means the demand for money is greater than it otherwise would be and you drive up interest rates. We have already seen Econtech say that just a minor roll-back of $4 billion will put up interest rates by one per cent - one per cent for every Australian mortgage holder. And now we have an education bond which could put up interest rates by another one per cent. No wonder the electors of Aston ought to be worried. The last time the Labor Party was in office in Aston, people were paying an extra $850 a month on their mortgage. - Rubbish, he says. You were in office in 1990 and the mortgage interest rate was 17 per cent. The last time the Labor Party held the seat of Aston in 1990, the people of Aston were paying 17 per cent interest on their mortgage, and we are not going to let you forget it. They were paying $850 a month extra on their mortgage, and that was after-tax money. If you were a resident of Aston, you had to earn $1,700 a month extra in 1990 to be in the same position as you are in now. What does roll-back mean? Higher interest rates. What do education bonds mean? Higher interest rates. What does borrowing from the public mean? It means that the Labor Party has only one plan. It is not a 10-year plan to invest in education; it is a plan to drive the budget right back to where it was when the Labor Party was last in government.</DOC>

 - If I were agnostically inclined, that question would shift me. I simply say to the member for Banks that I was advised that you got a better deal if you had a wine consultant. - I would that the duties of my office allowed me to indulge in the way that the honourable gentleman's question suggests, but I have to confess that, although I do enjoy a drink - that is known and it is not a matter for which I am the least bit ashamed - I do not think I enjoy it to the extent suggested by the member for Banks. I think this question speaks more of the priorities of the opposition. Let me say out of total charity to the member for Banks that I will cause a thorough search to be made, I will hunt it down and, what is more, I will share some of the proceeds of the search, if the honourable gentleman is so disposed.I think it is important that people are being entertained at the official establishment. Bear in mind that this is quite a long-range plan. It is not a 10-year plan but it is quite a long-range plan. If you had any faith at all in the compassion of the Australian people towards your side of politics, you would actually welcome it, but of course you clearly do not. I simply say to the member for Banks that we have the most historic visit by a foreign leader; with the help of the member for Werriwa, Tony Blair claims to have discovered the third way; and Carmen Lawrence has clearly discovered the fourth way. In context, the member for Banks did ask me about investment of Commonwealth funds. One of the more intriguing aspects of the suggestion made by the member for Fremantle in her remarks about education bonds - and I suppose you could have wine bonds as well - is that, as well as going out and borrowing the money for educational purposes, which the Treasurer so effectively pointed out is just another way of going into deficit, she actually made the quite remarkable -  - This is a very serious opposition, isn't it? I make the very serious point that one of the more remarkable things about the intervention in the economic debate by the member for Fremantle is that she says that if you issued a bond to finance education it would also add to national savings. Apparently you are going to raise it for education but not spend it on education, because it is going to add to national savings.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I am delighted to announce that this year the revenue of Australia's universities is at a record level of $9.5 billion. The government's support for science and innovation has grown from $3.8 billion in 1995-96 to $4.7 billion in 2001-02. Through the innovation action plan, Backing Australia's Ability, the government is investing heavily in research infrastructure, with an additional $738 million over the next five years, including major national research facilities. We have been able to achieve this investment in innovation and education because we have brought the budget back into surplus; we have filled Kim Beazley's $10 billion black hole. This is funded investment by the government in Australia's future. The problem that the Leader of the Opposition faces is that he cannot work out how to fund this knowledge nation policy that he is talking about - the policy that is based on the proposition that Australia is a dumb country. He cannot work out how to fund it. Senator Conroy pointed out to him that there are a couple of very good options. He could consider cuts - and I have to say that he has already decided to cut boarding schools. He could raise taxes - he has not come clean on that. Then the member for Fremantle, the shadow minister for industry, comes running up with her bright idea: she is going to take the budget back into deficit; she is going to use debt to fund it. Credit-card Carmen's idea is to bring the budget back into deficit. Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, made I think an honest statement - he is the Stephen Conroy of the House of Representatives - when in an interview with Peter Lewis on 1 June he said that this is the ultimate pitfall for Labor governments, because as soon as you allow the fiscal position to deteriorate and as soon as you start trying to patch it up with bandaids, creating an unsustainable position, you are finished. And here is the member with the box of bandaids. She has already tried to patch up knowledge nation, because they cannot work out how to fund this 10-year plan.The Leader of the Opposition has got form here. He left the Australian economy with so many fiscal bandaids wrapped around it, it looked like a mummy at the end of Labor's term in office. And now we have the fiscal third way from the member for Fremantle. She has finally got a way of funding this package. At the moment there is turmoil on the opposition side about knowledge nation. A month ago we had Glenn Milne reporting that Beazley's office was furiously rewriting Barry Jones's draft to produce a document. As Glenn Milne wrote:... which Jones's supporters see as another example of Beazley's office dumbing down policy.That is what the supporters of Barry Jones already think about knowledge nation. They cannot fund it; they cannot write it. A week before Michelle Grattan tells us, `It's going to be out next week,' one of the shadow ministers was up there trying to get something new into it. That is what she said: `They are going to put something new into it,' and `This is the way I think you can fund it to drive the budget back into deficit.' We have a weak Leader of the Opposition. He cannot get the policy right. He does not know how to fund it. He has never been fiscally responsible. All we want to know now is what taxes he is going to put up to fund Labor's policies as we move to the next election.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I note that, in his own figures, he reflected quite accurately that unemployment levels in that region are still very unsatisfactorily high. They were about 19 per cent when we came to government. They are about 14 per cent now. That is not to deny that other regions of the country face some high levels of unemployment, but I do not think anyone could deny that the structural problems in that area are quite deep and severe. If you look at the ABS data on the lowest household incomes in the nation, you will find that they are in that electorate and the surrounding regions. There is a very plain and obvious need to seek to engender some new investment, some new business prospects, in that region. Councils there are actively trying to help themselves with proposals and ideas which need taking forward. We are seeking to establish whether or not this sort of process can help, and we make no apologies whatsoever for doing that.The only other comment that I would make is that, of course, a good state government would help. From what we read in the newspapers, we thought the Victorian government was managing to preside over the most successful economy in the nation. When it comes to Queensland, just one simple thing: a decent regional forests agreement might have helped a great deal in that area. But, as usual, you had an attitude up there that just said, `We don't give a damn about jobs in rural and regional areas.' Investment in that industry has just been thrown to the winds by the state government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and also for her support of that fine tertiary institution in her electorate that does participate in what has become a great Australian export industry, the knowledge based education system within Australia. Last year this country exported $30 billion worth of knowledge based exports, a 48 per cent increase over the last five years. We have seen a significant increase, in the term of our period in office, in the level of knowledge based exports going out of Australia as part of the overall mix of export earnings for Australia. The majority, the top 10 markets for education exports out of Australia, are within our region of East Asia, and so that is especially good, given the economic circumstances within the region in recent years. Education, the member will be interested to note, has become Australia's seventh biggest export. It is bigger than wool, wheat or meat in terms of the earnings that it brings into this country from offshore. They are earnings that sustain jobs not just in the metropolitan areas of Australia but also in the regional centres across Australia, such as in the institutions in the member's electorate and, indeed, Mr Acting Speaker, in your own electorate. It is interesting to note that in 1991, when the Leader of the Opposition was the education minister, the figure that we earned from education exports was $995 million. Under our government, that figure has multiplied fourfold, and last year we earned $4 billion from Australia's education exports.Obviously that is attributable to sound management of the economy in Australia, particularly with the abolition of a lot of the tax burden on Australia's exports but also, as the minister for education outlined, with the significant investments we have made in the world-class education system that we have in Australia, where we already have a knowledge nation. The majority of Australians recognise that, and certainly a lot of people overseas who are buying education services from Australia acknowledge that. It is a wonder that the Labor Party has not worked it out yet, given its time in opposition. That has all been achieved at a time when we have been reducing the level of indebtedness of the Commonwealth. We inherited a $96 billion debt from the Labor Party when we took office. By the end of this fiscal year, we will have reduced that by having paid off $60 billion worth of Labor's debt. That frees up a significant amount of capital that can be invested in the future of this country.What are the opposition proposing to do? How are they proposing to fund their so-called knowledge nation? We heard today out of the Sydney Morning Herald that the member for Fremantle says it is going to be funded by education bonds and more borrowings. We and the Australian people have spent the past five years getting rid of Labor's debt, and they are flagging that as soon as they get back into office they are going to start running up that debt again - and running it up at a rapid rate. The Treasurer read a quote from the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, and I will read a couple of others. Further on, that article says:Dr Lawrence believes they would get a good response from financial markets because bonds are drying up as the government retires debt.Well, that is absolutely right: we are retiring debt. We are getting rid of the debt that the Labor Party burdened all Australians with. The Australian Labor Party are proposing all these policies, and we now know how they are going to be funded: by raising more debt from the public sector. This is the Labor Party that gave us some of the policies of the past - and we now know that the Leader of the Opposition is living in a time warp. They gave us policies like Investing in the Nation, Creative Nation, Shaping the Nation and Our Nation - and we all remember Working Nation. But now we know - the member for Fremantle has told us - what they are going to deliver to us. They are going to deliver us another debt ridden nation.</DOC>

 - I am not specifically aware of the details of that. If the honourable member wants to send all the details to me I will have a look at it straightaway and, if there is anything that reasonably and properly lies within the capacity of the federal government in the circumstances to accelerate the payment of the money to which those men and women may be entitled, I will be very happy to look at it. I frankly do not know all the details of it and I will not try to pretend, without checking, that I do. I take the opportunity of pointing out to the honourable member that the workers of that company and of a number of other companies have had support from the government under its entitlements scheme. In that particular case, the payments made by the Commonwealth government were matched by payments from the state government. To my knowledge, it is the only case in Australia where that has occurred. It would be a very good idea as well -   - If the member for Brisbane and the member for Paterson are interested in the welfare of the workers, they will -  - I would remind the member for Paterson -  - I have indicated to the member for Paterson that I will investigate it, but I was making the wholly legitimate point that one of the problems that workers have in Australia when companies get into difficulties and there is not enough money available to meet their entitlements is that the federal government has a scheme which funds up to 50 per cent of those entitlements but that that scheme is not matched by state governments. I invite the member for Paterson, if he is genuinely interested in this issue, and I would invite the member for Brisbane, if he is genuinely interested in this issue, to actually get on to Peter Beattie and Bob Carr, as I continue to get on to John Olsen and others, to encourage them to match our scheme. We are the only government in Australia that has ever introduced a scheme. That scheme would be of double benefit to the workers of Australia if it were matched by state governments, both Liberal and Labor.As to the particulars of that employee, I will make some inquiries and, if there is anything that reasonably can be done, I will do it. I will have to check all the details before I can say anything further.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question and recognise the interest she has shown in President Wahid's visit and indeed in Australia's standing in the region and the world. It goes without saying that President Wahid's visit was indeed a historic visit. As the honourable member points out, this is the first visit by an Indonesian President to Australia since 1975 and the first to our national capital since 1972.I am happy to tell the House that the government was very struck by the warmth and the success of the meetings that the Prime Minister and other ministers had with the Indonesian President and with our counterparts. We were able to discuss a number of issues which are of particular interest to us. One was our bilateral trade relationship, and I know the Minister for Trade himself had a good deal to say about how successful that has been in recent times. We were able to discuss investment issues and, interestingly, the fact that Indonesian students are now the largest group of foreign students studying here in Australia. There was excellent cooperation on the issue of dealing with people-smuggling. We did have some discussions with President Wahid about the proposal for a west Pacific forum. It has been agreed that at the foreign minister level we will move towards a dialogue between neighbouring countries, being Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Brunei. It is our view that this is a very good way of helping Australia, Indonesia and other countries in the region to work together to create an appropriate environment in our neighbourhood and to ensure that it is as stable and secure as we would like it to be.  There was also some discussion with our Indonesian counterparts about the issue of human rights abuses before and after the East Timor ballot in 1999. We expressed our view that we wanted those involved in those abuses to be brought to justice. Both the foreign minister and the President have made it clear that they are still committed to establishing ad hoc tribunals to deal with those involved in these abuses both before and after the ballot in 1999. We look forward to the ad hoc tribunals being established and the Indonesian government moving ahead with that process. The Indonesian side also sought further assistance from Australia to help with dealing with the problem of refugees in west Timor. We have already provided substantial assistance to refugees in west Timor -  somewhere in the vicinity of $6.8 million -  but we did make it clear to the Indonesians that we were very happy to continue to support them in dealing with those refugees. There are still problems that have to be sorted out. We and other members of the international community would be willing to provide some assistance for those who want to be relocated in other parts of Indonesia, and also, naturally enough, for those who wish to be relocated back to East Timor, whence they came. Overall, this visit was a great moment in Australian diplomacy. It has put the relationship with Indonesia on the terms that we want that relationship to be: a natural relationship between two partners, two friends, two neighbours, and also a relationship based on mutual respect. That is a very important principle. You often hear the Prime Minister and me talking about the need for mutual respect in our relationship with Indonesia. Both we and the Indonesians have been able to demonstrate that commitment to that principle very strongly over the last couple of days. </DOC>

 - The reality is that we are both right. Of course, the Prime Minister's science council made quite a number of recommendations in this area. That is, of course, what led to Backing Australia's Ability. I am puzzled that the Leader of the Opposition should see something strange about a government responding to the recommendations of an expert committee. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that the plan that was released by me on behalf of the government, the $2.9 billion investment in Australia's innovation and technology future, represents the largest investment by any government in the scientific future of this country in the last two decades at the very least. - The Leader of the Opposition professes to be interested in further strengthening the intellectual and scientific base of this country. I point out to the honourable gentleman that this plan has significantly committed funds to a process of bolstering Australia's capacity to pioneer technologies. For example, we have put in a pre-seed venture capital fund of $78 million; we have doubled the competitive research grants - that is, $736 million; we have provided additional funding for commercialising technology - $40 million; and we have increased funding for CRCs - an additional $227 million.  The difference between the government and the Labor Party on this issue is that we have done something; the Labor Party have merely talked. The other difference between the government and the Labor Party is that we do not talk down the intellectual base of this nation. The reality is that this country has been a superb user of information technology and, as a result of its superb use of information technology, we have lifted our productivity as a country quite dramatically, and particularly over the last five years. We are a nation which is second only to the United States in the utilisation of information technology in many areas. We are a nation so far from the `dumbed down' description that the Leader of the Opposition would seek to apply to us. We are a nation that is increasingly regarded with great and growing respect around the world as not only a highly intelligent nation but one that is in the very forefront of those that can use information technology.I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that we have put down a plan in this area. We have costed it, we have allocated budget funds, and we await with great interest the release of the alternative from the Australian Labor Party. When that alternative is released, we will go through it very carefully and we will find out how many things in our plan they have knocked out, what they have done with the money that they have taken from knocking those plans out, and whether they are going to spend that money on some kind of superior pursuit. The mail that I have, and the mail that the government have at the moment indicates that, right at the moment, Barry Jones's report is being rewritten in the Leader of the Opposition's office. They are doing a Latham on Barry Jones. I forget the name of the -  - Yes, they are, Mark. They are doing it again. They did it to you, and that is why you resigned, and apparently they are going to do the same thing to this report. We await that with great interest. We have been sort of half-promised that we would get a policy in the next few weeks, but then I read another newspaper article and I read that all that is going to happen is that they are going to release the Barry Jones report. -  - Oh yes, we are very worried about this! Having read the Leader of the Opposition's speech to the Sydney Institute, I can say, `Oh you to be so lucky,' because not only did the Leader of the Opposition offer no new alternatives, no new policy, but also he got all of his facts wrong. This thing is meant to be the piece de resistance of the Leader of the Opposition. This was the big one that was going to blow us out of the water. This was the secret Beazley weapon. This was the motser that he was going to have on us between now and the election. The reality is that we released the plan in January, we have committed $3 billion, and it has been widely applauded by the education and scientific community. The Labor Party, on the very best interpretation, are now into the business of catch-up, but, after the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition, I think they are also into the business of falling behind. We await with great interest and enthusiasm the release of the latest discussion paper on education from the Leader of the Opposition's office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. Obviously of interest to the member for Forrest is the live cattle trade that we are doing with Indonesia, which is of significant importance in the overall make-up of our export effort and trading relationship with Indonesia. Of course, this week marks a historic moment in the relationship between our two countries with the visit today by President Wahid to Canberra - the first by an Indonesian President for some 29 years. The question was about the investment delegation that I took to Jakarta in February this year. That followed a request by the Indonesians in the ministerial forum last year. In that delegation that I led we had 16 Australian companies represented by senior officers of those companies. Those companies represented $6 billion worth of Australian investment in Indonesia. Obviously they were taking a great deal of interest in what opportunities presented themselves, and the Indonesian side were looking for further investment in Indonesia while we were there. During the visit these companies signed deals and made commitments for a further $550 million worth of investment by Australian companies in Indonesia. Such is the confidence in the relationship between our two countries. Notwithstanding the sensitive issues that have been dealt with in recent years, the business, trade and investment relationship has continued to grow and flourish during that time and, of course, at the moment is in a very healthy state. That manifested itself with the commitment of those Australian companies during that visit in February.It is interesting to note that the Indonesian market is worth some $3.74 billion to Australian exporters of merchandise and that two-way trade is worth over $7 billion, making Indonesia Australia's 10th largest export destination. Not only is it our closest neighbour but it is also a very significant trading partner. Our exports are going from strength to strength, and we have been encouraging that in recent years. Australia's exports to Indonesia last year grew at 26 per cent, with a significant contribution being made by the cotton industry. Indonesia buys 28 per cent of Australia's cotton exports. Of interest to the member for Forrest: Indonesia is Australia's largest destination for live cattle exports, and that has been further enhanced by discussions here this morning between the Indonesian minister for agriculture and our own minister for agriculture. Indonesia is our second largest destination for wheat, taking 13 per cent of Australia's wheat exports last year. The business relationship between the two countries is also on a very sound footing, with some 400 Australian companies having a presence in Indonesia.One of the most important aspects of the trading and business relationship between Australia and Indonesia is the education sector. Indonesia is our most valuable export market for education. I will say that again: it is our most valuable export market for education, contributing almost half a billion dollars to the Australian economy and educating almost 18,000 Indonesian students. It has grown fourfold since the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for education in 1991. Indonesia recognises the importance of Australia's knowledge based industries. It recognises the importance and the standards of the education system in Australia. If 18,000 Indonesian students in Australia are using our educational services and  recognise the very solid and world-class education system we have in this knowledge based country, why cannot the Labor Party?</DOC>

 - Once again, we are both right. Having said that we are both right, I can say to the honourable member for Fremantle: your two statements - that you are going to have an education bond and spend the money on education and that that will add to national savings - are not both right. Those two statements are mutually exclusive. The challenge ahead of this country is to be a country that is capable not only of using technology and adapting rapidly but also of generating new ideas and commercialising them very effectively and very rapidly. This country historically has been very good at generating new ideas. In fact, we have always generated new ideas well above our population. Going right back to the 19th century there is a long and very proud record of Australia being a remarkably inventive country. We are also a nation that has punched well above its weight in areas like medical science. With, I hope,  the support of both sides of the House, can I remark how proud Australia is to see a situation where people are brought to this country for pioneering operations, whereas perhaps generations ago Australians would have gone to other nations for pioneering operations. I am referring of course to that remarkable medical procedure that was carried out by those very gifted surgeons in Melbourne on that young English boy, and we wish him a very speedy recovery. We record our admiration for the wonderful skill of those wonderful Australian surgeons.We need to be good users and adapters, and we also need to be good generators of ideas. We need to be able to transfer ideas into commercial value, and that is what Backing Australia's Ability is all about. I simply say to the member for Fremantle: do not put your faith in education bonds; they will drive you into debt. Do not put your faith in education bonds; put your faith and your support behind Backing Australia's Ability, because Backing Australia's Ability identifies the challenges for Australia in the future and responds with appropriate resources.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. One of the reasons that she is interested in defence is that she did her nurses training in the Royal Australian Navy. But she and others on this side are also interested in defence because we are very worried that the Labor Party, if it is ever elected, intends to target defence for expenditure cuts. The defence white paper set out the best plan Defence has had for decades. The budget backed that up with the first tranche of money to make it a reality. I am pleased to advise the House that I have today released the defence capability plan, which sets out in great detail, project by project, the acquisitions which the Commonwealth will be pursuing in the years ahead.I note a lot of comments about so-called Knowledge Nation and, in particular, the comments of the frontbencher on the other side who is going off with her education bonds to fund some vague set of promises that are about to be revealed. Whilst the Labor Party is talking about jacking up debt, the fact is that within the defence capability program, just in information capability alone, this government is not talking about acquiring capability; we will be spending $8 billion, which is paid for, in the defence of the country and building up Australia's industrial base in this crucial area. This will of course be news to the opposition. Only last week the shadow minister put out a press release saying:The government wants to have this Global Hawk, but they don't have the money for it.Not only do we have the money for it provided in the white paper -  - To your great disappointment, you will be interested to hear that in this defence capability plan we have the specifics of the Global Hawk, which the money was provided for in the White Paper. Don't you understand? Don't they understand, Mr Acting Speaker? The fact is when we say we are going to do something, we have got the money to make it a reality, it is funded, provided for, without the income tax increases which are inevitable if you look at the unfunded proposals on the other side. In conclusion, in this defence capability plan we have a plan for the decade ahead. On the other side, what do we have? Well, we do not have this. We have a list of unfunded promises: free submarines, a free Anzac battalion, a free coastguard, free specialised coastguard vessels, a free bombing range and a free Jervis Bay catamaran. I like the quote from the member for Melbourne, who has picked up some Conroy candour, as one of my colleagues said earlier today. This is what he told workers online:My role within the Opposition has been to try to prevent us from making promises that are not funded. It is quite easy to get carried away with particular proposals without having them properly assessed.This opposition is a joke.</DOC>

 - You can never believe what the Leader of the Opposition says; not at all. One of the great success stories of this government has been the family tax benefit, and the reason for that is that 2.2 million families and over four million children across this country have received substantial increases in family tax benefit. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with substantial increases in the family tax benefit being paid this financial year? What is more, we gave families choice. We gave them the choice of receiving their payments fortnightly or, if they wished, they could receive their payments at the end of the year. Most importantly - and something which was never the case under the complicated system of 12 complex payments, a system that we inherited from the Leader of the Opposition and the ALP when they were in power - we have simplified the process with only three payments and have increased the payment levels substantially for FTB parts A and B and for the child-care benefit. What is more, for the first time, if families have overestimated their income, we will give them a 10 per cent top-up. They never had that under the Australian Labor Party. We want to ensure that families do give accurate estimates, and that is why we have continually notified and advised families, and over 880,000 have made changes to their estimates over the past year. But the greatest thing that we have done for the families of Aston is to reduce interest rates, which were up to 17 per cent when you were Minister for Finance and are now down to less than seven per cent.That means that on, let us say, the average mortgage in Aston, which might have been $150,000, they are today saving - in comparison with when the Labor Party was in government and interest rates were at their peak - over $1,000 a month. That is a good reason that the citizens of Aston should return the Liberal-National Party government and never return the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I know how interested he is in Australia's international relations and the Asia-Pacific region. The government is deeply worried by the widespread violence and looting which has been taking place in Port Moresby over the last few days. I am particularly saddened to hear reports of the loss of life that has taken place. It is estimated that somewhere between three and six people have been killed. The last report I heard was that possibly as many as six people have been killed. The situation in Port Moresby remains very tense after such a dramatic period of unrest and there are, I understand, still people on the streets. My department continues to advise Australian residents in Port Moresby to exercise a very high level of personal security awareness. I would also recommend to all Australians who are planning to visit Port Moresby to look at my department's consular advice and make sure that they get an up-to-date version of that advice.Yesterday, the Prime Minister telephoned Prime Minister Morauta of Papua New Guinea to express the government's support for the Papua New Guinea government at this difficult time and to make clear Australia's continuing strong support for Papua New Guinea's economic and political reform programs. The Australian government has been, and will continue to be, a strong supporter of the reform programs of the Papua New Guinea government. We have provided over $192 million in loans to the Morauta government to assist in implementing its reform package. We have also been very active at senior levels, in discussions with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to encourage them to adopt a flexible and sympathetic approach to the implementation of these important and, frankly, difficult reforms.The Morauta government deserves strong support from Australia and also from our other regional partners and from international financial institutions. If Papua New Guinea stumbles and the reform program is abandoned, it will be a disaster for the Papua New Guinea economy and a disaster for the people of Papua New Guinea. It is very important that people in Papua New Guinea understand the consequences of the failure of the reform program. The Morauta government has shown itself determined to set Papua New Guinea on a path to stability and progress. It has done so not only with the economy but also with its excellent work on the resolution of the Bougainville crisis, in which resolution we have played a significant role. It is very important that Australia continues to give strong support to Papua New Guinea at this difficult time.</DOC>

 - I am certainly not going to rely on the member for Lilley's example, because we know plenty of examples, like the Lilley price watch, which are hardly credible. What I can say is that this Sunday there will be an increase in family tax benefits which will benefit all Australians. There will be a 5.8 per cent increase, and for families that is an increase of nearly $7 per fortnight for a child under 13 and $8.54 for families where there are children between the ages of 13 and 15. The fact is, there has been a massive increase in family assistance -  - Absolutely massive. I am glad the member for Paterson has interjected, because that will certainly help the citizens in his electorate, as it will help the citizens of Aston.Of course, what we do want to ensure is that those families who are receiving family tax benefit get their estimates correct. There are over 1.2 million Australian families who will receive it. There are about 1.8 million who are receiving fortnightly payments; there are about 400,000 who will receive it at the end, and they will claim it through the taxation system. There have been massive increases that have been of assistance to families. The other great element that the Liberal and National parties have introduced is over $12 billion in tax cuts, which they would never have got if the Labor Party had been in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I can inform the House that, under the government's new tax system, from 1 July last year Australian income tax payers received an income tax cut. They received it in full and on time. As a consequence of the government's reform of income taxes, if you earn between $20,000 and $50,000 per year, you face a marginal income tax rate no higher than 30 cents in the dollar. That applies to 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers. Average weekly ordinary time earnings in Australia today are $42,000. If the Labor Party's income tax rates were still in place today, a worker on average weekly earnings would be facing a marginal tax rate of 43 cents in the dollar. It was only because the Labor Party failed in stopping us reforming the income tax system that that marginal tax rate has been reduced for average earners from 43c to 30c.If we look at the taxation statistics, in 1998-99 there were nearly 1.3 million people who had taxable incomes between $38,000  and $50,000. Those people who under Labor would be on a 43c top marginal tax rate are now facing a top marginal tax rate no higher than 30 cents in the dollar. Tax relief for 1.23 million people, in reducing their top marginal rate from 43c to 30c -  -  - No wonder the Labor Party seeks to interject, because they do not like to hear that, if it had not been for tax reform, that marginal rate would be 43 cents in the dollar rather than 30 cents in the dollar.In addition to that, of course, the government introduced increased family assistance of $2.4 billion a year, as the minister has said. Let me talk about a family on average earnings of $42,000 with one child under five and two children in addition - a family with three children. Taking together their tax cut and their family assistance, that family has received, by way of a tax cut and an increase in family assistance, an extra $86 a week as a consequence of tax reform.  Why would the Labor Party have opposed tax reform? They opposed tax reform out of a mean, ideological, socialist spirit. They did not want to let average workers have a lower marginal tax rate. They did not want to help families. They were wedded to the wholesale sales tax of the 1930s, and they opposed great benefits for families on middle incomes. Families on middle incomes had tax relief delivered by the coalition, which has always been the party to support middle Australia.</DOC>

 - What that family would know is this: if the Labor Party had still been in government, that family would have been paying substantially higher taxes and substantially higher mortgage repayments, which would have a dramatic impact on their family and on their living standards. The government's policy is very clear, with family tax benefit part A and family tax benefit part B, which we introduced, providing a substantial increase in family tax benefits for single income families or sole parents. Indeed, ACOSS have specifically said that family tax benefit part B has been one of the greatest things that has assisted single income families and sole parents, because on average there has been a $50 increase in family tax benefits per fortnight. With family tax benefit part B, we gave them a choice. A single income family had one tax-free threshold; we thought it was advisable, if they had one income earner, to give them the benefit of perhaps another tax-free threshold whereby they could earn up to $10,000. If this family had gone back into the work force - and I will have to check that example - then clearly they have received family tax benefits that they may not have been entitled to. But I can tell you this now: that particular family, and indeed over 1.2 million families that are receiving family tax benefit part B, are receiving substantially more today than they ever got when the Labor Party was in government.</DOC>

 - I think you got to them first, Martin. I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. She asks me whether I can describe any of the benefits that have flowed from the competitive pro-consumer telecommunications policy of the government. Yes, I can describe many of those benefits; but, better still, I draw her attention and the attention of the House to an independent publication - not a publication of the Liberal Party of Australia or a publication of the Commonwealth government but a report from the ACCC. Interestingly, it is a report on communications services prices. I understand that this report has come out today. It makes very interesting reading. It makes particularly interesting reading when it is juxtaposed with the speculated Telstra policy of the Labor Party. This report says that, as measured by the primary index - that is, an index of the prices of all services and all consumers - between 1996-97 and 1999-2000 the prices of telecommunications services measured by that index fell by 17.5 per cent. It goes on to say that the fall for residential consumers has been 17.2 per cent; for business consumers, 15.6 per cent; for mobile telephony, 18.9 per cent; for local calls, 13 per cent; for national long distance calls, no less than 23.5 per cent; for international calls, 53 per cent; for calls from fixed to mobile services, 7.9 per cent; for all services in the capital cities, 25 per cent; and for all services outside the capital cities, 22.4 per cent. It then goes on to deal with the customer service guarantee and it reports significant improvements in connection and fault repair times, particularly in rural and remote areas. Fault clearance on time in rural areas is now 92 per cent. The figure for new service connections in rural areas with infrastructure is 93 per cent; in remote areas with infrastructure, 94 per cent; and remote without infrastructure, 90 per cent. This report is an excellent report card on the competitive outcomes of the telecommunications policy that has been followed by this government. As a result of the telecommunications policy of this government, we now have lower prices and better services across the whole gamut of services. This is much better than the old PMG, the 100 per cent government owned show that the Labor Party wants to go back to.I am invited by the member for Gilmore to ask whether -  - Yes, it is unbelievable how well this is done. I thank the member for Hotham for his constructive interjection. I have in front of me a report from the Australian Financial Review dated Wednesday, 6 June 2001. It seems to be authoritative - it is pretty well briefed, it has those little boxes and it is in a prominent position. It is written by Steve Lewis, the national political reporter. He is speculating about the Knowledge Nation report, which urges Labor to reregulate Australia's telecom sector. In other words, bring back the PMG. That is what this report recommends. The article says:The Labor taskforce, which includes the Opposition spokesman for communications, Mr Stephen Smith - that is the member for Perth, in case anybody had not noticed - recommends a rollback of competitive rules applying to Telstra to allow it to play a better role as a national telecommunications carrier.In other words, if this report is accurate, Labor in government would reregulate. Labor in government would bring back the PMG, Labor in government would remove the competitive pressures that now exist in the telecommunications market and, as a result, Labor in government would threaten the dramatic falls in the prices of telecommunications services that have occurred right across the board and they would threaten the enormous advances that have occurred over the last four years.This report by the ACCC vindicates the telecommunications policy of this government. It demonstrates that we now have lower prices and better services, and it is in stark contrast to the `bring back the PMG' mantra of the Leader of the Opposition that would threaten these declines in prices and would reduce the quality of services right across Australia, particularly in regional and rural areas of our country.</DOC>

 - Of course the government is taking this reconciliation issue very seriously, and that is why over the last three or four months -  - It is interesting that the member for Lilley never gives a bouquet to Centrelink. He is always the first to criticise this particular agency. I, for one, want to defend the 22,000 employees that work in Centrelink and the terrific job that they do, rather than being constantly run down by whingeing, whining Wayne because he has a political agenda there. To answer the question, yes, we put on about 700 people recently at Centrelink. More people have come on in our call centres during the last three or four months, because we want to make sure that families, when they ring one of our many call centres in this country, are able to give changes to estimates. It is particularly important that families give accurate estimates. That is why we have allowed this opportunity now: if they have made an underestimate in their income, we can top it up by 10 per cent.Of course they are going to be extremely vigilant when the new taxation system with reconciliation takes place over the weeks and months ahead into the next financial year. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with a government being prepared to assist families to ensure that they get their repayments, particularly if it is through the taxation system, or that they get their top-ups? There is nothing wrong with that. The great thing with the family tax benefit has been that families have received substantially more, particularly families with young children, whether they are sole parents or single parents, and there have been substantial increases in the child-care benefit, which there never was when the Labor Party was in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. Rail reform is very important in Australia, particularly in a context where the Bureau of Transport Economics is predicting a doubling of freight volumes in this country over the next 15 years. It is important not only for moving freight around but also it has great environmental advantages - fuel efficiency advantages. In urban congestion, it will be vitally needed in cities like Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane in the future. Labor neglected rail to the point where it virtually collapsed in Australia, yet the interesting thing is that we have had a real response to strong leadership from this government in better rail performance, where we have been able to get cooperation from various state governments.A very potent illustration of this is what is known as the east-west corridor across the Nullarbor - that is to say, from Perth to Adelaide and to Melbourne, and points beyond and points between - where in recent years we have seen travelling times come down significantly and we have seen costs come down significantly as four rail operators have competed for business above track. Volumes have gone up to the point where that rail link now has 77 per cent of the freight - perhaps the highest penetration level of any major freight corridor in the world - being carted by rail. That 77 per cent of freight across the Nullarbor on the east-west corridor contrasts with the next major corridor, which is the north-south corridor, at 10 per cent. The north-south corridor is from Victoria through to New South Wales and Queensland, or Melbourne-Brisbane and points beyond and points between. That is 10 per cent and falling on the north-south corridor, compared with 77 per cent on the east-west corridor, where there has been effective reform and cooperation. In response to this, we hear the inevitable calls for more money to be spent on rail. - We hear calls for more money from those opposite -  - and from New South Wales as well. It is worth acknowledging that there is a case for more investment. It is also worth pointing out that we have more money on the table, ready to run, when it is justified. But there is a fundamental problem - a very serious problem. In response to various reports, including the Neville committee's report, the Smorgon report and the Productivity Commission report into rail, I commissioned the Australian Rail Track Corporation to undertake a rail track audit. It found that real benefits would be achieved from future investment in rail in this country only if there was a more streamlined access management arrangement to the track between rail jurisdictions across the nation and a single set of management principles applied in each major rail corridor. The member for Hinkler is well aware of that reality.The interstate track has to operate seamlessly like road does if it is to attract the freight volumes that we want it to attract. That in turn will justify and produce the investment from governments and the private sector that are needed. But we are not going to waste taxpayers' money on rail until we know we will get a return. As I said before, you have got 77 per cent of the freight across the nation on the east-west corridor on rail, but you have only got 10 per cent on the north-south - that is, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Who stands in the middle of that corridor? Labor in New South Wales. That is who stands in the middle of that corridor.For all of the efforts, for all of the leadership, for all of the contribution to rail reform by many governments in this country, we still cannot get through the ARTC seamless rail access in New South Wales. That is what stands in the way of rail reform in this country. When it comes to transport reform, they were asleep at the wheel. We ought to take note of the form that is indicated by New South Wales. They are also asleep at the wheel. That is the major impediment to rail reform in this country and I can only urge that, in the interests of a rail sector in this country that produces efficient, reliable transport by the heavy freight sector, with massive environmental and economic benefits, the Premier takes some interest in this very important matter and gets on with the job of providing an environment where we can get the reform we need.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the member for Lilley asking me the same question, which I answered before. He is not only dumb and blind; he might also be deaf. I did say in answer to the last question that many months ago we put on about 700 extra staff in our call centres. We are planning; we are a government that responds to a whole range of situations - not like the previous Labor administration. I would also like to clarify a point that the member made in his question and also in an earlier one. He somehow makes this assertion that we are holding all this data back for political gain in the Aston by-election. That is absolutely incorrect. For your benefit, I will help to educate you. A reconciliation cannot occur until after the payments up to 30 June 2001 are made. That seems fair enough. We have to wait until the end of this financial year. We have got to be patient and wait till Friday.  - Be patient, my friend: you might learn something here. Some families will not receive payments until 13 July 2001 because they are on that pay cycle. Someone who receives payment on Friday, 29 June will not receive their full entitlement for the financial year until Friday, 13 June 2001. - July: I beg your pardon - Friday, 13 July 2001. - So we are going to post them all out on Saturday? The facts are that the reconciliation process is on schedule. Notices will be going out and, if you receive a payment this year on a fortnightly basis, you will receive it in two weeks time - that is, Friday, 13 June. - July. I keep on thinking of how much more money we have given this year. The only family you care about, Member for Lilley, are your brothers and sisters in the trade union movement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. I am aware of threats to innovation funding in Australia. Those threats come from the Australian Labor Party, which, in the Senate, is now obstructing and delaying the first year's funding of major initiatives which are part of Backing Australia's Ability, the magnificent $3 billion package to promote innovation and science in Australia. Passage of this bill is required by the end of this week if university students and researchers are to plan effectively for next year. Currently Labor is holding up next year's funding for the government's commitment of $995 million in postgraduate loans for lifelong learning, it is holding up the first year's payment on $736 million for Australian researchers, it is holding up $533 million for science infrastructure, laboratories and libraries, and it is holding up 2,000 extra university places. These places will not be available to be allocated when the universities require them, as a result of directions given to the Labor Party by the Leader of the Opposition. - You mean the Leader of the Opposition has not directed the Senate to do this? He has not directed it? This is all Senator Kim Carr's own frolic, is it? Has the Leader of the Opposition directed this or not? He is not in control. No, he does not control it. The chaos in the Labor Party is such that this is being held up in the Senate, apparently without the consent of the Leader of the Opposition. This shows the utter hypocrisy -   - of the Labor Party. It claims it wants to promote knowledge. - Yet it is threatening to stop the universities getting additional places to train students in science and information technology and innovation. It claims it wants to promote knowledge, yet it is threatening vital extra funds for our brightest researchers. It claims it wants to promote knowledge, yet it is threatening programs to build up university laboratories and libraries. The fundamental fact behind this is that Labor is desperate for money. We know it is going to cut money for boarding schools; it is preventing money going to fund new low fee schools, including Catholic parish schools and an Aboriginal community school in the Kimberley in Western Australia; and now, at the Leader of the Opposition's direction, it is stopping funding to the most important government investment in knowledge and innovation for decades. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition tried to kill off Carmen Lawrence's education bonds, because they gave away Labor's secret agenda of plunging Australian government finances back into debt and pushing up interest rates. But last night we learned that the secret agenda is still being pursued. According to this morning's Australian, education spokesman Michael Lee was due to meet the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee to discuss education guidelines. The secret agenda is still being rolled out. The Leader of the Opposition tried to hide it yesterday, and it is still being rolled out. That is what the Australian said this morning. My attention has been drawn to a further proposal by the Leader of the Opposition in the Financial Review on 18 May to provide mezzanine finance to fund his knowledge policies. My understanding of mezzanine finance is that that is the finance you get when your debts run up so high that the banks will not fund you any more. On top of that, you get mezzanine finance and high interest rates. The worst finance minister in Australian history is now casting around for these funny money alternatives to fund a policy that he has not got the money to pay for. This government's innovation policies are funded in the budget because we have managed Australia's economy well. The Leader of the Opposition is now creating uncertainty for all Australia's researchers and scientists. They do not know whether they are going to get any money out of this package, because he is directing that the funding be delayed in the Senate. All we do know with certainty is that the Labor Party continues to be what it has always been: a negative, obstructive opposition that you cannot trust with money.</DOC>

 - It is disappointing that the member for Lilley and the opposition have this policy - if they have a policy -  where they obviously do not agree with the family tax benefits, which have been extraordinarily generous. I was just wondering what, if you were ever to be successful in regaining the treasury bench, you would do. Are you going to roll it back? Are you going to strip away family tax benefits? Are you going to strip away -  - What we have done -  - is increase payments -  - What we have done is to increase payments dramatically to Australian families. That is a good thing. We have also educated Australian families so that, when they have a change in circumstances which affects their income, they need to let Centrelink know. That is why we have had over 800,000 families over the last five months -  - What I was attempting to say before I was interrupted by the Manager of Opposition Business was that there has been a substantial increase. What we do want, though, is for families to have to give their accurate estimates. We do not want to pay them -  - This is not clawback at all. It has absolutely nothing to do with it. What it is about is getting accurate estimates. Of course, what we have done, which we are the first government to do, is, if people underestimate their income, we give them a 10 per cent top up. That was never done when the Australian Labor Party was there. There have been substantial increases. What we want are accurate estimates, so that families get their correct entitlements - and that is what we are doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question -  -  - I note the very quick responses and jeers coming from members opposite. They are always very quick to condemn this government's program to assist dairy farmers who are struggling to come to grips with the decision by state governments to deregulate their industry. Labor has done nothing for dairy farmers. It has done nothing in Queensland, nothing in New South Wales, nothing in Victoria -  - Labor has done nothing to assist dairy farmers. - After the states acted to deregulate their dairy industries, this government put in place a significant assistance package for dairy farmers. That package has already committed over $1.6 billion to dairy farmers around Australia. But included in the package was a small element to provide assistance also to dairy communities. An amount of $45 million - hopefully boosted to $60 million shortly - will help provide assistance to those communities that have also been affected by dairy deregulation. The honourable member for Fairfax represents one of those communities. Indeed the Caloola shire is one of those areas that have been identified amongst the 10 most affected shires in the whole of Australia. So the dairy adjustment program has already provided 100 projects to create new jobs and new industry opportunities in communities around Australia.I am surprised at the interjections from members opposite, because when this program was introduced the shadow minister actually sought to take credit for it. He actually went out and said, `I called for provision to be made for regional adjustment assistance to help communities with the impacts of deregulation.' So the man who masquerades as the shadow minister, when he is not asleep at the wheel, supported this program when it was introduced. But, of course, over in the Senate, where Senator Forshaw actually runs Labor policy, the attitude is somewhat different. In fact, this week in the Senate, Senator Forshaw, when referring to this program and commenting on an announcement, said:Not so long ago, $1.5 million was announced by the Prime Minister ... for a meatworks in the electorate of the minister for agriculture.As usual, he got nearly all his facts wrong. It was $1.6 million. Also, the Prime Minister did not make the announcement in my electorate, nor is the meatworks in my electorate; it is in the electorate of the honourable member for Fairfax. It is a $1.6 million project that will create about 100 new jobs. That is the sort of program that Senator Forshaw is criticising. In fact, he actually called it `milk-barrelling'. That was the word he used. So, whenever assistance is to be provided to a country electorate, a country area suffering from deregulation implemented by a state Labor government, Labor dismisses it all as milk-barrelling. So there is a pretty clear message out there to people in rural and regional Australia: if ever Labor is elected, any programs that benefit rural and regional Australia are on the rack.Naturally, you cannot blame Senator Forshaw for getting the electorates wrong. I know that, like most Labor operatives, he has not left the city limits too long, so he has probably got his geography a bit mixed. But the reality is that this is a significant project in the electorate of the honourable member for Fairfax that has already -  - shown the potential to provide significant benefits for that region. So, once again, where are Labor heading? At one stage, we had the shadow minister for agriculture saying that Dairy RAP was a good idea. Senator Forshaw, who is usually running agriculture policy, says the opposite. We go into other areas as well. The shadow minister for education sits on the front bench, but the real decisions, or announcements, are made by the member for Werriwa. And we have the shadow foreign minister on the frontbench, but the member for Griffith making the decisions. Labor are divided. They do not know where they are going and it is high time they backed the government's initiatives to provide real benefits to dairy farmers around Australia.</DOC>

 - Over the last year, through numerous publications, through advertising and also through correspondence to those 2.2 million Australian families receiving extra family tax benefits - substantial increases under the Liberal-National government - we have continued to communicate with them to ensure that they give Centrelink an accurate estimate of their income. That is what we have been doing and that has been our policy over the last year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question and her continuing interest in the welfare of the workers of the forest industry in her electorate. Whilst she would be primarily interested in the arrangements in Victoria, let me inform the House that just recently grant offers were made to 11 separate localities within Queensland, where of course the state government has rejected any assistance to sawmillers and the Commonwealth has had to go it alone. The electorates involved are Blair, Fairfax, Wide Bay, Capricornia, Longman, Hinkler and Oxley. All of those particular electorates have benefited from a grant of $4.127 million. Furthermore, advertisements - that much criticised activity that the opposition levels at us - have gone out in New South Wales to invite applications for funds totalling nearly $40 million. The member for McEwen of course is very interested in the circumstances in Victoria, being a representative from that state. Five RFAs were signed in Victoria and an amount of money totalling some $42.6 million was allocated for distribution both by way of business exit and, of course, business development, which is the job creating aspect of this particular program. As a consequence, 12 industry development assistance grants valued at $5.3 million have already been offered to applicants in that state. Another 31 applications valued at about $9 million are well advanced in the assessment process, and I anticipate offers are imminent. These grants cover the forestry dependent electorates of McEwen, Indi, Gippsland, Burke and McMillan, and they will result in approximately $60 million when they are leveraged up by private investment of new investment providing new jobs and protecting existing jobs. There is a projected high total of $3 million going to one of those electorates.As I said a moment ago, this process was well advertised, and I have noted that a number of MPs with a genuine interest have made representations on behalf of the applicants in their electorates. Members from Victoria are currently giving applicants information and asking them if they can offer assistance, and they have been consistent in their applications to me, ensuring that the interests of their constituents are properly represented. In fact, those members are the member for Indi, Mr Lou Lieberman, the member for McEwen, Mrs Fran Bailey, and the member for Gippsland, the Hon. Peter McGauran. Other members making representations that have not received grants include the member for Corangamite, Mr McArthur, the member for Ballarat, Michael Ronaldson, and the member for Burke. If anybody has read my list of the forestry dependent electorates, they will note that there is one name missing - the person who stood up in this House yesterday, trying to gain a political advantage over the misfortune of his own constituents. What was he up to? He is quoted in the Sun-Herald today as saying that his electorate has not got a cent. Yet, in fact, in that first $5 million worth of offers, there is one very substantial offer to the electorate of McMillan. So he has already got some money. His problem is that he did not know, and, worse, he did not care. He has a habit of jumping up and making personal explanations. At the end of this question time, he might tell us who the body is that already has a grant, and, more, who is the other operator that is going to get three times as much money, if that application that is still on the waiting list is successful.Mr Speaker, I have called to your attention just how many people, including the member for Burke, have written to me and put their case for the workers, but I have had not one word from the member for McMillan. Has he rung up these applicants and said, `Listen, fella, is there any help that I can give? Can I use my office to go and talk to Tuckey about it?' Yesterday, the member for McMillan -  -  - Well, the member for Burke knows how to do it. As a more senior member of this place, it might be time he gave the junior member a bit of help in these matters. It is called looking after your own electorate. This is the person who, because he does not do his homework, chose yesterday to stand up here and say, `My electorate has not got a cent.' He does not know what is going on. The member for Gippsland had more local government people in my office this morning. He is a really good member. In fact, I am starting to worry about him; I think he likes me or something! He keeps sending these people in. - Ha! The member for McEwen is always there. But never has the member for McMillan cast his shadow upon my door. It would be a pretty poor shadow. But the reality is that there is a need for the member to go and talk to some of the people that are seeking government assistance because he can give them the value of the expertise of his office to ensure that they do get the money. But let me take this a step further, because in fact it is a habit of this member at the end of every one of my speeches of this nature to stand up and quote two letters he has written to me. We had better talk about those. The first one is a letter that asks for my assistance in a matter relating to a state government. - Isn't it amazing - the big guy is in to help the little guy. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. This is an important part of the question that I am now addressing. - The issue I wish to touch on in this particular answer is very relevant because it deals with the question that was put to me about difficulties I have in this matter. One of the great difficulties I have in assisting this industry exists in the electorate of McMillan, because that electorate is the most highly capitalised forestry products sector within Australia. It is the one that has the pulp and paper mills; and we know that of course they want sovereign risk security because of the huge investments they need to grow their businesses and create jobs in an electorate where the local member admits unemployment is very large.  I was about to explain why that is most difficult. I got the other letter from the member for McMillan, and in it he eulogised the RFA and its legislation. I got so carried away I went to the Prime Minister and I said, `Labor is obviously going to support the RFA legislation, which is so important to these larger mills such as those that we are trying to assist.' When I got that I thought, `The member for McMillan is behind it. This is going to get through caucus. He writes me a letter!' So I brought it on the next week, after getting this letter which has been put up in this House about three or four times; and on 13 October, after his letter of, I think, 21 September, we actually had a vote - and that vote the Labor Party opposed. - Thank you, Mr Speaker, I was in the process of doing just that. I had just informed the House that, having brought that regional forest agreement legislation back to the House, on 13 October there was a vote and it was recorded in Hansard on page 11526. Every Labor member came in and opposed it bar one. The member for McMillan was neither present nor recorded as a pair. - Mr Speaker -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The point that is most important is that here am I, here are numerous members of the government working their hardest to get funds into their electorates for their workers in the forest industry, and no electorate is more dependent on the forest industry than the electorate of McMillan. The member for McMillan gets up in this place yesterday. He did not care about his local people. He just wanted to make a political point over their misfortune. - We heard you, too. How did you vote?</DOC>

 - The normal process for the analysis of ideas, concepts and submissions that go to the heart of taxation is for them to be considered as part of the budgetary process each year. I can tell the honourable member for Calare that those proposals have been drawn to my attention and to the Treasurer's attention and that we have discussed them. Beyond that, I have nothing to add at this point in time except to make the observation that, wherever we have seen the opportunity to make legitimate advances in seeking to promote economic growth and better circumstances in rural and regional Australia, we have done so. I actually recited quite a list of those things yesterday. Again I refer to them and make the point that they were all done on budget, not in the red.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. Yesterday we saw an appalling lack of knowledge by the honourable member for Melbourne about basic budget processes when he described the contingency reserve as a `rainy day fund' - a piggy bank. The contingency reserve, which I might say was a mechanism used by Labor in their budgets -  - It is a mechanism for ensuring that the aggregate estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the budget. It includes commercial-in-confidence, national security in-confidence items, allowances for estimating biases, parameter revisions as well as, of course, late decisions. -  - Well, funds are not appropriated for items included in the contingency reserve. The appropriation is made by parliament at the first available time so that funds can then be drawn down by the relevant agencies.When it comes to strategic investment incentives, the Prime Minister announced -  from memory, in December 1997 - in the Investing for growth statement that incentives for appropriate investments in this country would be considered. The strategic investment incentives are contained in the contingency reserve. - That guru from South Australia - at least he believes he is - has now said, `Why don't you put them in?' Well, it is very, very basic, and I would have thought you had enough exposure in your former life to know how basic it is. You do not state a sum of money that is available for anybody to apply for; otherwise they will ask for the lot. Quite clearly, you want to evaluate what are the competing programs -  - and you want to utilise what you might use to ensure what projects are appropriate. That is why you do not state the amount that is there, but it is then appropriated.  - If the honourable member for Melbourne took offence at the Christmas Island aerospace project, which will create several hundred jobs in an emerging, new, smart industry during its operation, then he has the right to vote it down when it comes in the additional estimates - just as he could have voted down the support under this particular project that was given to the Visy pulp mill, which creates 250 jobs, and a $450 billion investment in Tumut; just as he could have voted down, again another very smart industry, the Syntroleum gas to liquids plant that this particular program assisted which is a case of fuel technology value adding to Australia's currently underutilised gas resources; and just as he could have voted down the support that was given to General Motors Holden in Victoria where they wanted to invest something like -  - $400 million -  - to develop a new fuel efficient engine for the car industry in this country, and this project supported it. That is what this particular fund is about and that is what it assists. It is appropriated and it comes through the parliament before it is drawn down by any department.Is there an alternative? Mr Speaker, I can tell you this: there was no piggy bank when we got there. There was no `rainy day fund' that had money sitting in it. What we saw, despite the contingency reserve, was a total ignoring of any proper budgetary processes which led to some $70 billion of debt being run up in the last five years of Labor. So what we saw in the context of proper budgetary processes was a complete ignoring of those processes to the point that we inherited debt. We certainly did not inherit any rainy day funds, and all that we have done subsequently is to ensure that there is a proper, economic process under the control of this government that allows us to support emerging industries that are creating jobs in this country. And we shall continue to do so.</DOC>

 - On Monday the member for Dickson came in here and made accusations that at a meeting on 16 February this detail had occurred. That turned out to be a NESA board meeting two days after I had been sworn in. I checked all of the records on that occasion and found that neither other board members that had been there, departmental people, minutes of that meeting nor my staff had any knowledge of that situation, because it did not occur. Now you come back today and say that at a meeting I attended on the Gold Coast with Leonie Green some time in April - and I take the April to be -  - I can confirm that I have visited many Job Network sites and Job Network members in the line of my duty, as getting across my portfolio, and one of those was Leonie Green, along with one of my staff. She at the time took us around her office and showed us different aspects of her business: occupational therapy, et cetera. In relation to your specific allegation that she provided me with some paperwork relating to a phantom jobs scheme, I can confirm that I have no recollection of receiving any such documents. Can I say that to suggest - which I presume you are - that a senior Job Network member, with millions of dollars worth of federal government money at her disposal to provide employment services, would inform me, as the minister, of some shonky practice and that I would then say, `Wink, wink, nod, nod, not a problem,' is stupid in the extreme, and I would expect even less of you. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. Events of the past few days, particularly the union-led blockade of the New South Wales parliament, have put on public display the real power relationships at the heart of ACTU-Labor Inc., the giant political industrial complex which is probably the biggest network of intrigue and influence that this country knows. At the heart of the wave of union muscle flexing which we are now seeing right around country is that strong sense that the unions have of ownership over the Australian Labor Party. Thanks to the notorious 60-40 rule, they know they own it - and they are determined to control it and to operate it.Just recently there has been a proposal from Premier Beattie of Queensland to change the 60-40 rule - not to abolish the 60-40 rule but to change it. He wants to change the rule so that the size of the union bloc vote depends not upon the size of its membership but upon the size of its donations. This is a novel concept, this is a world first from a supposedly democratic party, to make the size of your vote depend upon the size of your wallet. Let us make no mistake: this is not about cleaning up the Australian Labor Party; it is about taking power off right-wing unions, such as the AWU, and giving it to left-wing unions, such as the CFMEU, which have more power to extort things like compulsory donations to the union picnic fund, which it can then recycle into Labor Party coffers. Anyone who has witnessed the actions of the CFMEU in recent times would say that taking power off the AWU to give it to the CFMEU is like taking power off the mafia and handing it to the triads.This problem is not just about union power and influence but also about the historic weakness of the Leader of the Opposition. Today the Courier-Mail carried a report on Premier Beattie's proposals to change the union bloc vote rules. It says that Kim Beazley privately regards the Beattie decision as too severe. But then it says:But Mr Beazley -  - I was asked about the influence of registered organisations, particularly unions. I am dealing with Premier Beattie's proposals to reduce the influence of unions. - I am quoting from this morning's Courier-Mail, and it says:But Mr Beazley will only back a national executive push for change if the Premier is happy with any compromise.Here he is - he is the one person inside the Labor Party who cannot do anything without getting permission. He is like a schoolkid who cannot do anything without getting a note from his parents. His attitude seems to be, `Of course I must follow them; I am their leader.' The Australian people have come to the conclusion that he is as tough as a bowl of stewed cabbage. </DOC>

 - I can confirm, as I said to you on Monday, that I have asked the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business to expedite the investigation into the Leonie Green and Associates allegations that were made at Senate estimates, and they are doing that. As I indicated to the House on Monday, it is my intention to be able to bring that information to the House as soon as possible, and I would like to be able to think we could have that done tomorrow. I cannot give you that commitment, because it is done at arm's length by the department. But we are making every effort to ensure that I can make a report to this House on those allegations.I am aware of IPA, and once again your false and malicious comments about false jobs and phoney jobs should be pursued. IPA did in fact employ people to distribute material. - The IPA company has been operating a temporary staff labour hire company since 1984. In 1992, IPA commenced working with unemployed job seekers under the government contracts of the day and has done so continually since that time. In relation to this particular issue, it employed some 26 people, I think, to distribute material where it was offering short-term employees to local employers. - Now am I to suggest that the shadow minister has a problem with wage subsidies, which has been a policy of the Labor Party for many years. - So now are you suggesting to the Labor Party that this is a failed policy. I come back to IPA and the question at hand. The personnel that were employed by IPA as promotional walkers have instructions and guidelines, which I have here -  - It is a pre-screening form which each member had to fill out. Every member of IPA has been assured as to their continuing to work in a proper job, not a phoney job. I would suggest that, if you wish to make those allegations, don't use the privilege of the House but do so outside of this place and see what occurs.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. If I understand it correctly, your banking policy gave us a 17 per cent housing interest rate, so I certainly will not be adopting your banking policy. If my recollection also serves me correctly, it was under the watch of the Leader of the Opposition in government that the process of privatising the Commonwealth Bank was commenced - not a process, incidentally, that we opposed. In fact, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, if it had not been for our support in opposition, it would never have occurred. But, of course, I take the opportunity to remind the Leader of the Opposition that he had two Commonwealth banking policies when he was a minister in the Keating government, and they were completely contradictory. One of those was when one of his colleagues wrote to the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association and promised them, before the 1990 election, that there would be no privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. Without going back to the Australian people for endorsement of a change of policy, the other policy was to decide to proceed with the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank.Let me say, in relation to the reported remarks of Mr Murray - I use the expression `reported remarks' - that I did not think they were particularly sensible remarks. I think banks do have social obligations. Banks in this country are very stable, they make very big profits, they operate in a very benign economic climate, and they have social obligations. That, incidentally, is a view that I have had for a very long time. I hope that Mr Murray was misquoted, because I think he is a bank executive of very great ability. But I think that everybody who runs a large organisation in this country has social obligations to the more needy in the Australian community. The other observation I would make is that I think that what he was probably saying to the Leader of the Opposition was: if you start interfering too much in the operation of corporations, you will end up producing the wrong result. -  - Well, I simply remind those who have any recollection of the history of banking policy in this country that there was a time when, in the name of helping the needy, we maintained a regulated interest rate regime in this country. The direct result of that system was that people stopped depositing their money with banks because they could not get a market rate of interest. We had a situation where people could get a loan from the bank only if they took a small loan from the bank and topped it up with what was called `the rest of the cocktail' from a finance company. The point I simply make to the Leader of the Opposition and those who sit opposite is that the best policies to help the needy in the Australian community are policies of low interest rates, low inflation, low taxation, high employment and strong economic growth. Those things, more than regulation, will deliver benefits to the poor in the Australian community. The thing about banking policy of which I am most proud and every man and woman who sits behind me is most proud is the current level of interest rates. When Labor was in office, we had 17 per cent housing interest rates. I take the opportunity again to remind this parliament that the last time the Labor Party held the seat of Aston bank interest rates for housing loans were at 17 per cent. And mortgagors were paying something in the order of $700 or $800 a month more than they are now paying for their mortgages from the Commonwealth Bank and indeed from other banks. The best banking policy is a low interest rate policy, and the best side of politics to deliver a low interest rate policy in this country is the coalition. </DOC>

 - I am aware of a lot of evidence about the new taxation system -  and it will be a year this weekend. - I am glad the member for Hotham says `Hear, hear!' Let me just remind the House that, when we had the final debate in this parliament close to two years ago on the legislation to give effect to the new taxation system, I pointed out to the parliament that, over the last 20 years, this country has faced a number of major challenges of economic reform. We faced the need to reform our tariff system, we faced the need to reform our financial system and we faced the need to reform our industrial relations system. For a long time, the thing that was left undone was the reform of Australia's taxation system. Much as the Leader of the Opposition will now try to run a negative position of the GST, he knows as well as does the member for Hotham that in the long run this country needed tax reform. But, in order to get tax reform, it needed a government and two political parties to have the courage to bring it in.I know the fond dream of the Leader of the Opposition is that he can surf to office at the end of the year off the back of public unease about the introduction of a new taxation system. The judgment about whether he is right in that negative approach will ultimately be made by the men and women of our country. Like anybody in politics, I will await and accept the decision of the Australian people. But let me say that I have been heartened in recent months by the growing acceptance within the Australian community, despite the transitional challenges, that we did need taxation reform.The member asked me whether I am aware of any independent analyses. I can recall over the course of the last 12 months that, time after time, I have had the name of Mr Chris Murphy of Econtech thrown up at me. I have been asked to endorse his analysis. I do endorse an analysis made by Mr Chris Murphy of Econtech. He addressed a post-budget vital issues seminar at Parliament House earlier this month. As part of that presentation, Mr Murphy provided his assessment of how the new tax system had panned out now that it had been in place for almost a year.His first point was that the impact of the new system on the CPI appeared to be just under three per cent in the September quarter, and that that was much less than the 3¾ per cent estimate made by Treasury at the time of the introduction of the new system. He also explicitly noted that the inflationary impact was not 10 per cent, as a lot of people, particularly those opposite, would have led the Australian people to believe that it would be. He also, very importantly, as illustrated by this very effective chart, pointed out to those who attended the seminar that the financial position of not only people on average earnings but also people in receipt of the pension was significantly in advance of increases in the consumer price index, including the impact of the introduction of the new tax system. He pointed out that, whereas the CPI had risen by six per cent, the age pension in the relevant period had risen by 8.1 per cent and the after tax average wage position of people on average earnings had risen by 8.2 per cent. Let me repeat that for the benefit of those who sit opposite: CPI up by six per cent, after tax average wage up by 8.2 per cent, pension up by 8.1 per cent. On the basis of that, the member for Hotham, the member for Lilley and all of those who sit opposite continue to go around spreading falsehoods about the impact of taxation reform within the Australian community. This is not a document that I have prepared. It is not a document that has been prepared by Treasury. It is a document that has been prepared by an independent economic analyst. It gives the lie to the claim that in some way the mainstream of the Australian community has been hurt. Indeed, economic analysts concluded that you have to get to $230,000 a year before the benefits of the tax package begin to disappear.I believe this country's economy has been strengthened by tax reform. We needed tax reform, and tax reform has delivered the largest ever reduction in personal income tax. It has taken $3½ billion off the cost of exports. It has provided a sound revenue base for the states, so that in the years ahead they will have the resources to deliver higher levels of protection in areas such as public health and police services and will be able to provide more money for state schools and all the other bread-and-butter things that states are responsible for under our constitutional arrangements. That is the reason why, in reality, the most enthusiastic advocates of taxation reform in their private moments are the Labor state premiers of this country. They are, despite what they may say in public, privately gleeful about tax reform, because taxation reform has given them access to a secure revenue base to fund the provision of services to the Australian community.Tax reform was a challenge. Tax reform provided a challenge for the government. It provided a challenge for the business community. I take the opportunity to thank the business community of Australia, particularly the small business community, for the way in which they have handled the transition. I recognise and acknowledge that there have been some transitional difficulties, but in the long run what this country wants is a government that is prepared to undertake decisions for the long-term benefit of the Australian people. They certainly do not want an opposition whose only stock in trade is to hope that what the government is doing goes wrong, and which has developed no alternatives of its own.</DOC>

 - Of course, I can never take the word of the example that the member for Lilley has given me because his modus operandi is not to come up with any policies - because they do not have a families policy - but to come up with any tactics that are going to scare the over 2.2 million Australians who have received substantially more family tax payments. One of the issues that he is going to, I suspect, is the issue with family tax benefit part B. This is in regard to some of the administration methods. The whole premise we have is that families are getting more assistance, but we do require them to give their accurate estimates. As far as family tax benefit part B is concerned, 1.2 million Australians have received that. It partly compensates for having only one tax-free threshold. It replaces six complicated forms of assistance. FTB part B provides more assistance and has more generous income testing arrangements. Households will always be better off financially, of course, if that second earner starts to go to work and a household has the benefit of additional income earned as well as the benefit of two income-free thresholds. The whole premise of FTB part B was to give families choice. If one member of the family, whether male or female, wishes to stay at home, then of course we would reward them through increased family tax payments, particularly for children under the age of five; or, if both parents decide to work, then both parents take advantage of the two tax-free thresholds.You supported this legislation - the Labor Party supported this legislation, as well as the reduction of payments. I would just like to quote the shadow minister for family services and aged care back in June 1999:First of all I want to indicate at the outset that the Labor opposition supports the thrust of the major bill in that it seeks to consolidate 12 existing family payments into two and to simplify two child-care payments by creating one single regime. Labor supports those measures as being a step in the right direction in terms of simplifying it and making it more understandable for Australian families to access social security payments.What are you on about, Member for Lilley? You supported this legislation which increased payments quite considerably. And of course we do expect families to give their correct estimates. That is why 880,000 families have changed their estimates over the last 12 months to ensure that their estimates are correct.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for asking his question, and asking it again, and again. If I may, I will give only one answer; it is the same answer to all three questions. Last year, on 1 July, this government abolished wholesale sales tax and in its place we introduced a goods and services tax, which gives a $3½ billion reduction in tax to Australia's exporters and has pumped more money back into the rural and regional communities of Australia. Last year, on 1 July, this government cut income tax for all income tax payers. For a family on average earnings, if we had not have done that, today their top marginal tax rate would be 43 cents in the dollar; but under the coalition it has fallen to 30 cents in the dollar.On 1 July last year we put the states on the basis of a revenue stream which today pays for every schoolteacher in every classroom in every school in every state of Australia. And, after it has done that, it pays the wages of every policeman on the beat in all of the states of Australia. Last year we cut company tax from 36 to 34 per cent, and on 1 July this year we cut it further, to 30 per cent. On 1 July this year we abolish the financial institutions duty. On 1 July this year we abolish stamp duties on shares. And from 1 July this year pensioners and other low income earners in Australia can claim back the tax on their dividends from shares if it is in excess of their own personal income. For an average family on $40,000 a year with three children, one under five, the combination of income tax cuts and increases in family allowance has put them in front by $86 a week. They are getting, in increased payments or in reduced income taxes, $86 a week. And that, of course, helps with the cost of raising children.The Prime Minister earlier referred to the fact that under the government's new tax system the fortnightly pension has gone up by $30 a fortnight or 8.1 per cent. I would like to also refer members of the House to what Mr Chris Murphy from Econtech said at his Vital Issues seminar on 6 June 2001. Perhaps it did not get the coverage it deserved - 6 June 2001 was the day the national accounts came out showing growth at 1.1 per cent. It was also the last time the shadow Treasurer asked me a question in the House. He seemed to go off asking questions after the Australian economy went into growth 10 question times ago. Chris Murphy, who has done modelling for the Labor governments of New South Wales and Queensland and the Tasmanian Labor government - he has done modelling for Dr David Crean, the Labor Treasurer of Tasmania - said that pensioners would be in front. What he actually said was this:Over the same period of the new tax system, the age pension has increased by $30 a fortnight, or 8.1 per cent. Pensioners are actually around 2 per cent better off, although you wouldn't know that from most media reports on the issue.We agree with him on both those counts. Then he went on to wages. This is what Chris Murphy said, and I think that this should be tabled at the end of question time:Someone who is on an average wage, which is around $40,000, 12 months ago under the old tax scale I showed you, they were paying around $10,400 in tax with an after-tax wage of around $29,600. If they have had the average wage increase over the last 12 months of 3.7 per cent, they are now on a wage of around $41,500. However, once you apply the new tax system to the new wage level, even though their wage has gone up, their tax bill has been cut by $1,000, so their after-tax wage is up 8.2 per cent.Up 8.2 per cent. If the Labor Party had had its way, if the Labor Party had maintained the old tax system, that family on average earnings today would be paying a top marginal rate of 43 cents in the dollar. It was the Liberal-National Party that decided to give average wage earners a go. It decided to cut their marginal tax rate to 30 per cent. It decided to increase family tax assistance. It decided to put in place an economic policy which has kept their interest rates low. It is the Liberal-National Party that had the courage to reform the tax system to make things better for families on average wages - and it is families on average wages which have been the focus of improving their assistance and income tax cuts under the reforms of the Liberal-National Party.</DOC>

 - As always, I never accept on face value what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition puts. I will get a copy of the letter, analyse it and I may write back to the person concerned. But let me just for the moment be completely serious with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He asks what I would say to the small business community of Australia in relation to taxation reform. What I would say to the small business community of Australia in relation to taxation reform is that this country has needed a modern, contemporary, export supporting, incentive based taxation system now for at least a quarter of a century. I would say to the small business person in question, if he has in fact written in that fashion, that one of the reasons we brought in the new taxation system was to bring about a taxation base for the future that recognised that we are, like most other Western communities, a progressively ageing community and we need to create a revenue base that can deliver the services that the citizens of this country will want in the years ahead.This parliament is meant to be a place in which ideas are exchanged and debate takes place, and the judgment that ought to be made on the GST is not a judgment as to short- or even medium-term popularity; the judgment is to the long-term contribution it makes to strengthening the economic and social infrastructure of this country. In all of the toing-and-froing that has taken place over the debate, the impact on individuals is very important, and I yield to nobody in my continued assertion that the impact has been very beneficial, particularly on average families, as has been pointed out by the Treasurer. But we should not lose sight of the fact that there is a long-term social infrastructure element in this and there is a long-term economic infrastructure element in this. With an ageing community, I would have thought that the worst possible recipe is to have a taxation system that relies increasingly on personal income tax as a source of revenue and completely ignores -  - He interjects and says it came down. Under you it goes up, that is my point. - When you criticise our prescription -  - Yes, I know you do, but you also have an obligation to put forward an alternative. In the end, in this country, the people of Australia are asked to make choices about which government they want, and in making a choice the Australian people will look at what this government has done. They will make judgments - not all of those judgments will be positive; we hope the majority of them are but not all of them will be - and they will also then turn around and say, `What is the other side offering? What is the other side saying about the long-term strength and the long-term position of this country?' What they will look at in relation to the Labor Party concerning taxation is a party that, for the last 5½ years, has run the politics of negativity, for the last 5½ years has hoped and prayed that everything we did went wrong and for the last 5½ years has talked down the Australian economy. It is an opposition that, for the last three months, until the release of the national accounts, tried to undermine the confidence of the Australian community in the strength of this economy.So I would say to that small business person that this country has needed taxation reform for a long time. I would say to him, `When Labor was last in office you were paying interest rates of at least 17 per cent.' I would say to that small business man that the growth rates under this government have been far better than the growth rates were under the former government. I would say to that small business man that it was the boast of the former Labor Prime Minister of this country that we actually had a recession. I would say to that small business man that the spending power of his customers, the spending power of the consumers of Australia, has been much greater over the last 5½ years because people are paying lower interest rates, they now are paying lower personal income tax, they have higher real wages based on greater productivity, and there are 800 or 1,000 more of them in the work force, having wages to spend, families to support and, therefore, purchases to make, including purchases from bottle shops and assorted wineries around Australia. I would also make the general observation that he operates in an industry that has been one of the great success stories of Australia's export behaviour, and I would say to him that one of the good pieces of news out of the GST is that we have taken $3½ billion off the backs of exporters. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. During the last five years of the Labor government the option which it used to fund Commonwealth spending was to borrow the money. The way in which a government borrows money is it issues bonds. Whether you call them Treasury bonds or education bonds, you borrow from the public and under the bond you are required to repay it. Apparently, driving the budget into deficit and issuing bonds is one of the things that the member for Fremantle has been looking at.Another way of funding your promises is to increase taxes. One will recall that was what the Labor Party decided to do after the 1993 election, when it increased petrol excise by 5c a litre and wholesale sales tax by 2c and increased all of the personal income tax rates. As I said earlier, I may be feeling unloved by the shadow Treasurer, who has not asked me a question in the last 10 question times, but I never forget him because I keep under my pillow at home one of my favourite press clippings, of 14 August 2000. I polish it up every night, and I always remember him as I go to bed at night. -  - I have had a lot of trouble sleeping, I can assure you of that. - It is that famous clipping where he promised that he was not going to put up taxes and he was not going to spend more money and he pledged the Labor Party to bigger surpluses:Federal Labor has pledged to deliver bigger Budget surpluses than the Coalition during its first term ...It was `bigger surplus Crean' that led to the nickname B.S. Crean, by which he is universally known throughout Australia. My mind went back to this - how you had BSs, no tax rises and increased spending - when I was thinking of the second last Labor government to get elected in Australia, and that was the Labor government of Western Australia. Before Dr Gallop, a close friend of the current Leader of the Opposition, was elected in Perth on 3 February 2001 he said:We are planning surpluses. We are not going to increase taxes and charges. We are going to reduce government spending in areas that are unnecessary and redistribute the money to real areas of need.That sounds rather familiar. It sounds very similar to the formulation we have been getting from the federal Labor Party, so we ought to be entitled to know how it works out. Yesterday the Western Australian Treasurer, the Hon. Eric Ripper, after the pledge of budget surpluses and no increases in taxes, made the following announcement: an increase in water rates, 3.5 per cent; an increase in motor vehicle registration fees, five per cent; an increase in sewerage rates, 3.5 per cent; an increase in compulsory third party insurance premiums, two per cent; and an increase in drainage rates, 3.5 per cent -  all after a promise in February of no increases in taxes. No wonder the federal Labor Party uses Dr Gallop as one of its role models. I shall also alert the House that the actual effect on an average household, according to the Hon. Eric Ripper, was $38. But if you look carefully you will see it was actually $58. He said he that he was entitled to discount it to $38 `on the grounds that abolition of financial institutions duty would soften the impact'. So the state Labor government goes out, makes a promise of no increased charges, puts up water rates, motor vehicle registration, sewerage, third party insurance and drainage and says, `Oh, but we're entitled to deduct from all of our tax rises the fact that the federal coalition government funds the abolition of financial institutions duty.' How deceitful can you get!It proves that, if the Labor Party had had its way, financial institutions duty would never have been abolished. You opposed tax reform, including the financial institutions duty, all the way through. We know how these promises work out. We know how they worked out in 1993. We know how they worked out in Western Australia in 2001. Now can I inform the House of further news in relation to Labor's unfunded promises to spend. The Leader of the Opposition released at the Sydney Institute some time ago the first instalment of his so-called Knowledge Nation - a project which was written by, amongst others, Professor Simon Marginson, who writes today in the Age:To reach this level - of Knowledge Nation; listen to this from Professor Marginson - we need to invest an additional $12.3 billion a year ...The author of your report says that $12.3 billion a year is the required investment. Next Monday we are going to see - because we are going to see Knowledge Nation in all of its glory revealed, including whether it takes the education bonds and the tax rises and what programs are going to be cut. Do you know why that sum of $12 billion took my imagination, Prime Minister? How would one fund $12.3 billion a year? You would totally reverse the tax cut of 1 July last year. That is the kind of dimension you are talking about. If you want $12 billion a year, it means you would have to change tax rates and put every average earner who is currently on a top marginal tax rate of 30 cents in the dollar right back where they were under the Labor Party, on a top marginal tax rate of 43 cents in the dollar. When people hear `Knowledge Nation', what they ought to hear is this: higher taxes, broken promises, increased interest rates and economic irresponsibility.</DOC>

 - I enter what I call the normal ALP caveat in relation to questions that are based on correspondence. I could say a few things to Mr Ferguson. I will not indulge the hubris of a person whose name is well remembered in this place by saying to him, `You have never had it so good.' I will not make that foolish error, but I tell you what I will say to him: if you measure by retail sales the economic conditions in which small business operates at the present time -  and if you are running a business you normally like to sell things, whether those things are goods or professional services or other kind of services - retail sales are not doing too badly. I would point out to him that the rate of inflation now is significantly below the average rate of inflation during the 13 years of Labor government and that we have very strong economic growth and dramatically lower interest rates. If you were put against a wall and were asked for the one single reason above all other reasons why, if you were in small business, you would never dream of going back to Labor, it would be the absolutely absurdly high level of interest rates that operated under the former Labor government. If you were buying a home or running a business when Labor was in office, you were paying 17, 18, 19 or 20 per cent interest rates. If you were a farmer, you were on a bill rate of sometimes 22 or 23 per cent. I have lost count of the number of men and women in small business whom I have met all around the country and who may even have had an argument with me or with the government about one aspect or another of policy but who, time after time at the end of a conversation, have said to me, `Well, I mightn't agree with you on that particular issue, but I tell you what: I will never go back to voting for the Labor Party after what their high interest rates did to my business and the devastation of those high interest rates on my business and on my family.'The small business experience of this country has permanently etched upon it the destructive effect of those high interest rates that occurred when the Leader of the Opposition was a senior minister in the Hawke government and a senior minister in the Keating government. What made it worse is that the people who imposed those high interest rates boasted that they were the right solution to the nation's problems. I can only say to the men and women of small business in this country that, like any other section of the community, you are entitled to take issue with the government about this or that policy but, at the end of the day, high interest rates will do more damage to your business than any other policy. And, on that ground alone, never countenance going back to the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. Off the back of policies that have delivered low interest rates, low inflation and higher productivity, of course Australia's exporters have benefited dramatically from the removal of $3.5 billion worth of taxation burden from their backs in their competition with the rest of the world through this government's new tax system introduced almost 12 months ago. One commentator said to me, `It has been like putting a set of flippers on Ian Thorpe in making our exporters much more competitive with the rest of the world.'There were some interesting comments and some interesting forecasts when we were having the debate a little over 12 or 18 months ago about the benefits of tax reform and the removal of that taxation from exporters. We all remember the prediction that the member for Fraser made during that debate. He said:Well, the GST overall should be good for exports.He went on to say:I'm not a fan of the GST as you might imagine but if there's one thing that's a plus for it, it is that it should slightly help our exporters.Guess what: the member for Fraser was right - we agreed with him then and we obviously agree with him now - because Australia's exporters during the last 12 months have done extremely well. They have performed with absolute excellence and, since the introduction of the new taxation system around 12 months ago, our exports have risen by 24 per cent.  - By 24 per cent, since we removed that burden from their back - the monkey of the Labor Party off their back. That growth in exports, as far as our economy is concerned, in the first quarter of this year, the March quarter, helped to deliver us a trade surplus of $575 million, which was the first trade surplus we have had in a long, long time. But it was off the back of that strong export figure.Of course, this excellent performance by Australia's exporters and the benefits that they are gaining from taxation reform go right across the Australian economy, including into the seat of Aston where companies like IDT Australia, which is a biotech and pharmaceutical company - not a dumb company but a smart company in a smart economy - exporting to the world from Boronia, and Camatic, which manufactures theatre seats in Wantirna for Australia and the world, are doing extremely well.These companies are much more secure in their position in our domestic economy and in the global economy because of the policy settings that this government has undertaken. They have achieved improved levels of exports because they have got a better economic environment in Australia, with higher productivity, lower interest rates, lower taxation from this Sunday - with a 30 per cent rate of taxation for companies from this Sunday - and the abolition of financial institutions duty from this Sunday. All this equals a much more stable economic environment and base from which they can work in the Australian economy and export to the world out of the seat of Aston.Couple that with low mortgage interest rates and it is little wonder that the electors of Aston are worried about the possibility of a Labor government. The one thing that they have not forgotten is the high interest rates that they suffered from the last time Labor held Aston. The last time Labor held Aston they were paying an extra $850 a month on their mortgage rates. They have not forgotten that, and they will never forget it. They are very, very frightened about ever seeing Labor back in power because of that fact.The residents of Aston now know that they are facing a very clear choice between the coalition and the Labor Party. With the coalition, they are going to see a stronger economy, low interest rates, low inflation, lower taxation, more exports, more jobs and less national debt. Under Labor, they know that they will see more debt - Carmen Lawrence has told us that -  - They will see more debt -  the member for Fremantle has told us what their policy is with regard to funding some of those policies - high inflation, more taxation, and Senator Conroy told us about higher taxation from the Labor Party, and fewer exports. Dougie Cameron has told us what you are going to do to our exports; Dougie Cameron has told us what your policy is. That all equals fewer jobs. But, most importantly, the electors in Aston know that a Labor government will deliver them much higher interest rates - the way they were in 1990.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first thing I would say is that I would very much appreciate, if the member responsible is happy and if the small business man concerned is happy, having a copy of the letter, because I would welcome the opportunity to respond. I would be the last person to sound an inappropriate note of triumphalism over some of the difficulties that rural and regional Australia has faced in recent years, but I have to say this: I will defend to the hilt our decision to move to an indirect tax system that removes the burden on exporters.Just a moment ago, I heard the Leader of the Opposition say that tax reform was not worth anything to farmers because they did not pay those taxes. I do not know what we have to do to get the message over to people like the Leader of the Opposition, but the reality is that through what was known as `cascading' - it is not exactly rocket science - the indirect tax system that they defended for so long hit rural industries across the board at every level of activity but never more so than at the point of exports.Small businesses in communities like Orange are dependent upon export performance. That is essentially what rural and regional Australia is about. About 80 per cent of what they produce goes on to export markets. Almost alone amongst exporting countries, we had our hands tied behind our backs by a tax system which loaded up on exporters. That has been removed. I would also, with respect, seek to point out to the writer of that letter that he might inquire of the ALP as to whether they seek to reimpose the wholesale sales tax mess; whether they seek to go back to the old days of ramping up fuel excise ad infinitum - 500 per cent in 13 years; and whether they would like to declare their hand one way or the other on a whole list of very important rural and regional programs that they have never taken a stand on. You have the member for Batman out there whose favourite occupation in life is straddling a barbed wire fence. He cannot take a position on anything. It would be very nice just to know on one or two things whether they either agree with us or disagree with us, so that we can actually have a debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I am aware of recent statements regarding education expenditure from none other than Professor Simon Marginson in today's Age newspaper. Professor Marginson, as the House has been reminded, is none other than the co-author of the report which the Leader of the Opposition so proudly touted a week or so ago on Australia's comparative performance as a knowledge nation. This is an article which is little more than political special pleading. It, like the Labor Party itself, denigrates Australia's performance as an advanced technological nation. It denigrates Australia's educational performance, and it is full of inaccuracies and selective statistics.The article is wrong when it says that Australia is an old economy, because according to the Economist Intelligence Unit we are second only to the United States in the world in terms of our e-readiness. The article is wrong when it says that university enrolments are falling: the latest data is that university enrolments this year are 2,996 higher than last year and some 30,000 higher than when Labor was in office. The article does not tell readers that the participation rate of 16- to 17-year-olds in full-time education has climbed from 75 per cent in 1996 to 78.8 per cent in the year 2000. It does not inform readers that 386,000 places have been created in TAFE over the last five years; it does not tell readers that apprenticeships have doubled; and it does not tell readers that illiteracy rates have halved. It does not tell readers that Australian university revenues are at an all-time high of $9.5 billion. What this article does show is that Professor Marginson shares the Labor Party's view that no dollar is so good as one that has been taken from the taxpayer and that no taxpayer can spend their own money half as well as the Labor Party can spend it for them. There is no talk in this article about how you increase national investment in education. You never hear anything about that from the Labor Party. You never hear anything about that; all you hear is how many more dollars are going to be taken from the taxpayer, how many more dollars government is going to spend on behalf of those who benefit from education. Professor Marginson in fact comes clean at the end of the article with a figure on how much extra needs to be spent on education to make Australia, in his view, comparable to the United States and Britain. That figure is $12.3 billion extra per year. This is Professor Marginson: $12.3 billion per year!Professor Marginson is modest there. He says this is not going to happen overnight. But the reason this is not going to happen is because the Labor Party is still working out how it is going to fund it. Is it going to be by expanding deficit spending, is it going to be by mezzanine finance, is it going to be by pumping up interest rates to funnel taxpayers' and small businesses' money back into the government coffers, or is it going to be by putting up taxes?We know what the Labor Party is all about. We have just seen the Labor Party in Western Australia putting up charges on water and public transport and electricity and car registration, despite hand on the heart promises that this was not going to happen, that taxes were not going to be raised. Wherever you see the Labor Party in office, you see it spending more of taxpayers' money and putting up taxes and interest rates. That is what the voters in Aston will be remembering on 14 July. They will be remembering that the Labor Party stands for higher interest rates and higher taxes.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition invites me to say whether I stand by this or that comment. I say this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: I stand by the belief asserted by the government when this new tax system was introduced that it would be beneficial for this country. The experience of the last 12 months vindicates that statement. Of all the things that I have been associated with in public life which I believe have been to the long-term benefit of this country, tax reform is certainly up there with the best of them. Specifically in relation to welfare organisations in the Australian community, I take the opportunity to point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that one of the great advantages of a broad based indirect tax like a goods and services tax, when all the proceeds are dedicated to the state governments of Australia, is that those state governments have the wherewithal to provide the services, thereby creating a situation where many of the concerns of welfare organisations in the Australian community are better addressed. I believe that the changes we have introduced are producing a better partnership, a better social coalition, between the state governments, the federal government, philanthropic individuals and the welfare sector of the Australian community.The distinguishing feature of this whole question time would be very apparent to anybody who has been watching. It is the last question time of this session, it is the last question time before the first anniversary of the introduction of the new taxation system. On the one side you have a government that have had the courage to introduce a historic taxation reform. You have a group of men and women who have called it for Australia; you have a group of men and women who have not set out to trash the national interest for partisan political advantage; you have a group of men and women who have recognised that the responsibility of government carries with it the responsibility to introduce reforms that are to the long-term benefit of the Australian community. And we are faced with an opposition whose only stock in trade is to scaremonger, to mislead, to oppose, to undermine, to sabotage and to torpedo the efforts of a government to introduce important reforms.We have now had 5½ years to try to find out what the Leader of the Opposition stands for. Somebody said to me yesterday that one of the things that strikes him about the Leader of the Opposition is that, in relation to the same issue, sometimes he will say yes, sometimes he will say no, sometimes he will say both yes and no, and sometimes he will say nothing at all. This man who sits opposite me has had 5½ years to summon the courage to tell the Australian people what he believes in. He has failed that responsibility and he deserves the condemnation of the Australian people as a result.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Like many of us on this side, he would remember that, before we gained government in 1996, when you moved around Australia, one of the issues that came up not infrequently - if I can put it that way - was a concern on the part of a lot of Australians that the unions had undue influence in the management of the country and that people needed to be able to run their businesses a little more freely. When they wanted an illustration, it was nearly always the waterfront that they talked about. There had been, I think, 39 inquiries into the waterfront since the end of the Second World War. The taxpayer spent a fortune on WIRA and whatever it delivered, and no-one, but no-one, believed that any progress had been made.We came into government and set about taking on waterfront reform as a priority of the government for the nation. One of the indicators of our intentions to achieve reform was that we set a benchmark across the nation of an average container movement of 25 per hour. The response was perhaps predictable; it was certainly one that downplayed the capacity of Australian workers and downplayed the necessity for an efficient waterfront for jobs and economic prosperity. The response was: `You can't do that in Australia.' Australians could not deliver an average of 25 container movements an hour. Who was it who said that Australian workers could not manage that sort of performance level? It was the ALP and their mates in the union movement. They said Australians could not do it. They had us down to about 18 movements an hour - that was the average across Australia. We were a laughing stock internationally. Australians could not move 25 containers an hour - that is what the MUA, the waterfront unions and the Labor Party said. We have the latest figures. We have Waterline -  - We will come to stevedoring charges in a minute. I am very glad you raised the subject. - I am sure all members are very interested in this set of figures. In the March quarter of 2001, we hit an average across Australia of 26.4 containers an hour. That is up substantially from 25½ and 24.9 in the respective two previous quarters. Crane rates above 25 containers an hour were achieved at all five major container ports across Australia. Further, it is worth noting that, in the broader context of port operations, berth availability for the March quarter also hit a record level of 99 per cent. -  - You always know when they would rather we were not talking about something that is important to Australia - they do not want to hear about it. I want to actually respond to a couple of the interjections, because at the heart of those interjections were that no-one has benefited from waterfront reform. I have heard this before. In fact, I can tell the House that a Labor senator, Senator George Campbell, recently stated in a speech about waterfront reform in the Senate:Australian exporters are not benefiting one red cent from the process.Mr Llew Russell is the chief executive officer of the Liner Shipping Services Ltd. His carriers carry approximately - and this is interesting - $60 billion worth of exports out of this country. I think he might know a bit about waterfront reform and how important it is. He was so concerned that he undertook a very interesting exercise. He wrote to the member for Batman, pointing out that he was very concerned about this and other related comments, and that he felt it necessary to indicate the improvements in demurrage, in truck waiting times, in reduced inventory levels for exporters and, most importantly, in the reliability of shipping with fixed day sailing schedules. All these are worth real money, they are real improvements in our export competitiveness and provide real jobs to Australians. I have to say, first, that it is absurd for Senator Campbell and other members of the Labor Party to claim it has not been worth while.  The second and very important point is that Mr Llew Russell has written to the member for Batman - the opposite number - in effect asking him to state his position. We have not been able to get the member for Batman to state a position on anything of any substance. We do not know where he stands on aviation, on shipping in general or on rail. We do not know whether they support more doctors and better services in rural and regional Australia, but on something as basic as the waterfront I think we would all agree that it is time he showed his hand. On waterfront reform, are you with the union movement and your ACTU mates? - Will the member for Batman declare that waterfront reform has been important for Australia and for Australian jobs, and that he therefore supports it? The question has to be asked: if the Labor Party -  - If the Labor Party cannot provide a position on something as basic as whether they support waterfront reform or whether they intend rolling it back, how could the Australian people ever hope to know what they might stand for in government? - No, Mr Speaker. I table the document.</DOC>

 - No, they have not. I do not have the bit of paper with me, but I will get it before the end of question time. Let me just illustrate from recollection that the most spectacular fall related, I think, to international, and that was over 50 per cent. So I do not know how a rise of seven or eight per cent can wipe out 50 per cent. But I am well aware of the period that it covered, and I made absolutely no attempt to disguise that fact. The figures I quoted yesterday were totally accurate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I acknowledge her considerable professional knowledge and skills in this area of property, deriving from what she did professionally before entering parliament. They are of great value to the government. In 1996 the property stock inherited by the coalition government was badly maintained, managed inefficiently and underutilised. In fact, the majority of agencies and departments had no formal lease or occupancy arrangement. The government had no idea of what the true cost of owning property amounted to and no idea of what the true cost of leasing office space amounted to after 13 years of this area of government administration being totally neglected.  Many of those properties did not even comply with occupational health and safety standards. I recall the problem that the Treasurer and I had with the area that Treasury and the Department of Finance were occupying. There was some concern that the building may have been condemned and they had nowhere to do their work. That again is an indication of the quality of Labor's administration. When it came to selling properties, they only sold on an ad hoc basis when they needed that little bit of extra cash to fund their increasing deficits or to attempt to keep those deficits down. Immediately this government moved to introduce some property principles which provided some greater transparency and accountability in the management of Commonwealth property. There was a divestment program which matched the priorities of government and the government's needs, and there was an implementation of commercial leasing arrangements. Yesterday a report was tabled by the Australian National Audit Office in respect of three case studies on Commonwealth leasing. Whilst I am still examining that report in some detail, I make that point that suggesting that in 1996-97 we put undue influence on the terms and conditions that agencies entered into is not correct. It is a little silly to suggest that undue influence was placed on the heads of agencies, who signed off on those arrangements under the Financial Management Act, where they had to indicate they got value for money. The second part of the question asked whether I was aware of any instance where the Commonwealth did not receive value for money. I looked around and I saw a particular building about one kilometre from this chamber. I checked to see what the rental was on that and I was told that currently it is $717 per square metre per annum. I thought: how does that compare with other premium grade, quality office rental space for the CBD? Colliers Jardine tell me that the average cost for rental space in the CBD of Brisbane is $220 per square metre. This one, about a kilometre from here, costs about $717 and Brisbane $220. For comparable office space it is $250 for Perth, $203 for Adelaide, and for Melbourne $350 per square metre per annum. I eventually got to a building in Sydney called Chifley Tower - 41 stories high and, up near the top, premium quality rental space costs $645 per square metre. I asked myself: what do you get for $645? Having been up there a few times, I immediately thought that if you look north you see a magnificent harbour and if you go past that you see such wonderful places as North Sydney, Bennelong, Warringah and Mackellar. You can get to the Brisbane Waters and you can even get as far as Robertson, you are up so high. The view is magnificent. If you looked east, you see down through the heads - on a fine day you could probably see the All Blacks training in Auckland, you are so high. If you looked south, you might not get over the escarpment of Wollongong, but you would certainly settle on some pretty good places like the electorate of Cook and the electorate of Hughes. If you looked west, you would see the progress that is being made in the Blue Mountains by the local members there. If you did not want to look too far, you could look down and you could see a four metre statue, in steel, of Ben Chifley. This is all for $645 per square metre. My thoughts returned to the building in Canberra - $717 - and I said, `Where is this place?' It is just down the road in Barton. I said, `Who is the owner?' I found out that the owner is John Curtin House Ltd, a fully owned subsidiary of the Australian Labor Party. I asked what was the cost of comparable premium quality leasehold space in Canberra. I am told that it is about $330 per square metre. So here we are close to 2½ times that. I said, `How long does this lease go for?' They said, `For 15 years, and by about 2004 it will cost over $1,000 per square metre per annum.'When it comes to looking at what the Australian taxpayers deserve - and that is value for money and leasehold value for money - over the 15-year life of this lease the Australian Labor Party will pocket, above market rent, $36 million. The Audit Office did not include this as an example in yesterday's report, but I do know that they have tried to negotiate with the Australian Labor Party to redo this lease and that they have met a dead end every time. The Australian Labor Party should give that $36 million back. Every year that that lease goes up at a compound rate of nine per cent will be another legacy to the Australian people of the waste and mismanagement that the Australian Labor Party thrive on, as they demonstrate through this edifice down there called Centenary House.

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for asking me that question. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: you have it within your power to make Australian families $36 million better off by paying -  - That was a rotten deal and you know it. That money is going -  - You established a pipeline from the federal Treasury to the headquarters of the Australian Labor Party. You ought to be ashamed of yourself for that. - You ought to be ashamed of yourself -  - Mr Speaker, I repeat, through the chair: the Leader of the Opposition could help Australians families by paying back that $36 million out of the coffers of the Australian Labor Party.  -  - The former national secretary -  - I was asked about the impact of policy on the families of Australia and the taxpayers of Australia. What I said was utterly relevant to that, and it remains utterly relevant. In relation to the other part of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition in which he listed a litany of alleged broken promises, we made a commitment to the Australian people when we went to the electorate in 1998 that, if re-elected, we would deliver to them an improved taxation system. We promised that we would deliver them a taxation system that would make Australian families better off, and we did. We promised that we would deliver a taxation system that would give the states a growth tax, and we did. We promised that we would deliver a taxation system that would take $3½ billion off the back of the exporters, and we did. We promised to deliver them a taxation system that would have for the short term only a stated impact on the consumer price index. In fact, we overdelivered on that promise because the impact on the CPI was less.Above all, in bringing forward this taxation system, we promised that we would take into account the long-term economic and social interests of the Australian community. This country has needed tax reform for a generation and over the last 25 years it has been in the long-term interests of Australia that we have tax reform. Every person who has held a position of leadership on either side of politics in this House over that 25-year period has known in their heart that we have needed taxation reform. But the only person who has held that position, who is still in this parliament and who has been prepared to undertake the political heavy lifting to bring about that reform is me, along with the assistance of the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration and everybody else. In the end, you are judged on what you are prepared to do in the long term. I will always be prepared to have what I have done in relation to tax reform compared with the action of the Leader of the Opposition as a member of a party that has taken the Australian taxpayer for a $36 million ride via the lease on Centenary House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Over the last few days there have been a number of questions asked of me in this House by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister. Yesterday, the member for Dickson asked me to confirm that I had accompanied my adviser on a visit to Leonie Green and Associates Gold Coast headquarters on 10 April, and I reconfirm to the House that I in fact did do that. After question time yesterday, I confirmed with my adviser that there was no discussion about the use of Leonie Green and Associates of - and I quote the shadow minister - `her labour hire firm to place job seekers into what the opposition are calling phantom jobs'.The member for Dickson also asked me to confirm whether documentation regarding the future expansion of this scheme was supplied to me or my adviser by Leonie Green on 10 April. I can confirm that I was provided with three documents at this meeting, and I take the opportunity to inform the House of the title of each of these documents and to table them. The first one is Research utilization models: Frameworks for implementing evidence-based occupational therapy practice. The second document is entitled `As a Job Network provider how do we most effectively assist mature aged job seekers return to the workforce?' and the third document was Australian Occupational Therapy Journal, volume 47, issue 4, December 2000. I table them. They are the three documents that were referred to and they are also the subject of a notice of motion put on the Notice Paper by Senator Collins in the other place. The notice of motion by Senator Collins last night also asked me to table a full copy of the interim report of the investigation currently being undertaken by my department as a result of the questions raised during Senate estimates hearings on 4 June. Before talking to that, Senator Collins also asked for a diary note, and I thought it would be worth while tabling that. At that particular meeting on 10 April - and it was an informal meeting - I was given a tour of the Leonie Green and Associates headquarters, met with her key personnel and, at that time, we had informal discussions. There were no notes taken and therefore there are no notes that I can table for you.In relation to the interim report, my department advises me that it has been unable to provide an interim report, given the short time frame of this investigation. However, after receiving verbal briefing last night from the team investigating this matter, I directed my departmental secretary, Dr Shergold, to summarise the findings to date, to explain the issues which have been identified and the proposed action to be taken prior to the full report being made available. For the benefit of the House, I will now provide an overview of that letter, and I will then table it. The letter has today's date, and Dr Shergold writes:As advised to you, despite best endeavours, it will take a further few weeks before a final Enquiry report can be completed. The key factor dictating this timetable is the need to undertake a complete survey of all Job Matching placements made since January 2001 with Anchorage Labour Hire (ALH), the company affiliated with Leonie Green and Associates (LGA), one of our Job Network members.He goes on to say:Whilst the Department's Legal Counsel has advised me that no evidence has been found to date of fraudulent activities on the part of LGA, it would be imprudent to draw a final conclusion until the Enquiry is completed. I should note that the company is co-operating fully with the investigations. It is essential to the success of the Enquiry that LGA and ALH be able to participate without being subject to external pressures or interference.He goes on to say:The investigations to date into the Job Matching activities of LGA through ALH have already been extensive, including formal interviews with management of both organisations, with staff in a large number of LGA's regional offices and with present and former employees. A thorough review has taken place of Departmental files and interviews have been conducted with relevant staff. These enquiries have identified a number of significant issues that need to be addressed including:the appropriateness of certain claims for payment by LGA;lines of accountability within the Department; and Job Network policy issues, in particular relating to the current terms of Notification of Non-payable Outcomes and related contractual matters.With respect to LGA's operations, what has already emerged is that a significant number of Job Matching places through the Victorian offices of ALH ... clearly involved people undertaking self-canvassing for jobs, which is not permitted under the contract. LGA has accepted that almost 200 payments were incorrect and has agreed to their repayment. ... Further inquiries will provide information on:the extent to which the work undertaken fully satisfied the minimum 15 hour requirement over five days;the extent to which placements arose from an extensive degree of job splitting; and the nature and effectiveness of individual servicing received by job seekers in the arrangement of their placements.He goes on to say:From a thorough survey of the Department's records, I can also confirm that you were not briefed on any allegations relating to compliance or other aspects of LGA's activities - regarding either the market research work or telemarketing positions arranged through ALH - prior to that date. Furthermore a search of the minutes of the NESA Board meetings of 16 February, 6 April and 1 June 2001 indicate that no discussion of labour hire companies is recorded ...... the Enquiry has noted that the Department's independent Investigation and Compliance Units, having identified a potential problem with the surge in Job Matching placements by LGA in February, commenced investigations of LGA claims through March and April 2001. He also says:... Finally, LGA never sought, nor could they have gained, approval from the Department to job seekers being `employed' in self-canvassing for their own jobs ... This practice is clearly at odds with contractual obligations under Job Network.He further says:Finally, in line with your wishes, I am expediting the conduct of the Enquiry to enable completion of the investigation as quickly as practicable, mindful of the importance of providing greater certainty for all Job Network Members and their clients. As indicated above, the major outstanding task for the Enquiry is to conduct a complete survey of all job seekers placed with ALH over the last six months. As directed by you, I will separately review the Department's policy framework to examine if any changes are required.I table the full details of the letter provided to me by the secretary. In relation to a comment made in that letter by the secretary to me where he refers to there being outside interference, I inform the House that I have received an email today, dated 28 June, from Leonie Green, via the departmental secretary, Dr Peter Shergold. Ms Green writes:Dear Peter,... Cheryl has been calling my mobile phone numerous times asking for me to provide information for her to use ... It became obvious last week that while she offered me her 'support' agreeing that LGA had not done anything wrong, she (her office) was simultaneously feeding misinformation to the press.She goes on to say:I can only suggest that this example of scare tactics is a desperate attempt to gain my confidence ... I find her actions deplorable and destructive. It appears that she spread this rumour widely and my staff (and their families) and our clients have been very adversely affected.In this email she also provided me with a transcript of a message left on her phone service, dated Wednesday, 27 June, 11.48. The transcript says:Hello Leonie, it's Cheryl Kernott. I can understand why you feel a bit tentative about speaking to me at the moment ... There's a strong rumour circulating that you're going to be closed down on Friday. And that could well be before the report's made public. You might want to talk to me about that before question time. I'm in my parliament house office ... and my direct line is 2112.The shadow minister should not be spreading misinformation, let alone contacting a person who is the subject of an inquiry by this department. This is deplorable and destructive behaviour, and I call on the shadow minister to desist.</DOC>

 - The answer is that there is a very clear difference: if there is an available surplus, he will spend it; if there is an available surplus, we will give it back via income tax cuts. Nothing will alter that; nothing that appears anywhere will alter that unassailable difference. This is the first question in parliament after returning from a five-week recess, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition most warmly for enabling me to point out once more to the Australian people that if there is an available surplus we will return it via income tax cuts, but he will spend it. So let the Australian people understand that, when it comes to tax, that is the difference between us. I warmly thank the Leader of the Opposition for giving me such an early opportunity to define the difference between the government and the opposition. </DOC>

 - I have come across some research, and that research underpins and very strongly supports the government's historic decision to introduce major reforms to Australia's taxation system. This research from Access Economics demonstrates that the introduction of the goods and services tax as part of tax reform has added to the capacity of Australia to fund the services that will be needed for an ageing population over the years ahead. It demonstrates very dramatically that if we had continued to rely on the favoured indirect tax system of the Labor Party - that is, the wholesale sales tax system; the system they voted to retain when tax reform was introduced - we would face increasing difficulty in funding the services needed for an ageing population in this country. We hear a lot from the Labor Party about the need to have adequate public services. You cannot have adequate public services unless you have an adequate tax base. That is one of the main reasons why we embraced the introduction of a broad based indirect tax; namely, a goods and services tax.What Access has done in this research is to examine what the ageing population means for Australia's indirect tax base and, in particular, how a continuation of the sales tax base may have fared compared with the new tax system. Access found that, over the last 25 years, the sales tax base declined relative to consumer spending. The sales tax base fell from 24.5 per cent of total consumer spending in 1975 to only 18.4 per cent at the time of its abolition. It was projected by Access that, if the decline had continued, the sales tax base would have fallen to only 14.4 per cent of total consumer spending by the year 2030. That is a decline of 10 per cent, from 24.5 per cent in 1975. Those figures demonstrate the critical need to broaden, strengthen and deepen Australia's indirect tax base.That is why the states like the GST. They may say otherwise, but the reason that Bob Carr and Peter Beattie literally ran to grab the fountain pen out of my hand to sign that interstate agreement was that they knew that, over the years, the growth in revenue from the GST would make it easier for them to provide the services that they are obligated to provide. If the government had not introduced a goods and services tax, we would have been failing in our responsibility to secure the revenue base to provide services for years into the future. Those who seek to undermine the GST are seeking to undermine Australia's capacity to look after an ageing population. Those who seek to roll back the GST, allegedly in the name of fairness, are in fact arguing to roll back our capacity to fund necessary welfare services into the years ahead.Worse than that, the Access Economics report illustrates that, if we had not introduced a GST, not only would we have had a failing and declining, deteriorating and withering wholesale sales tax base but also to compensate for the revenue decline we would have had to increase income tax at a fast rate. Access makes it very clear that the alternative to the present tax base is higher income tax. That is why the Leader of the Opposition said with some vigour on the eve of the Aston by-election, `I don't believe that income tax in Australia is too high.' When the Leader of the Opposition says that, he is really saying, `Give me an opportunity and I'll jack it up.' That is what the Leader of the Opposition is really saying.  The research of Access Economics demonstrates and validates the courage of the government's decision to introduce a broad based indirect tax. Not only has it enabled us to reduce personal income tax, not only has it aided our exports and not only has it aided us to make the whole tax base more efficient; it has also provided Australia with the capacity to fund the services for an ageing population years into the future - something that the Labor Party has pledged to reverse through its commitment to a policy of roll-back.</DOC>

 - I am just struggling to remember which Labor Party charter of budget honesty that question is based on. I am just trying to remember; perhaps the Treasurer can help me. What was the bill that the Labor Party introduced when it was in government, requiring retiring finance ministers and Treasurers - like the Leader of the Opposition - to come clean with the Australian public? This is a question from a deputy leader of an opposition that, when it was in government, did not have a charter of budget honesty. For 13 years, it had no charter of budget honesty. More than that, Mr Crean is deputy to a man who was finance minister in the Keating government and who, on that occasion, ran around during the election campaign saying that the budget was robustly in surplus. Mr Beazley said, `Let there be no doubt about it; we are in surplus.' When we got into government, we found that, far from being in surplus, Labor was running a deficit of $10½ billion in the financial year to June 1996 and we inherited a $96 billion government debt. By the end of this financial year, we will have repaid $58 billion of that $96 billion. We will have one of the lowest, if not the lowest, government debt to GDP ratios in the world at 6.4 per cent. To add insult to injury, the Labor Party tried every inch of the way to stop us doing our duty to the Australian people. And you have the nerve to ask me about a charter of budget honesty!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I can report to the House that the trade figures for June this year showed a very healthy surplus of $537 million. Not only that, but four of the last five monthly balances were in surplus - not in deficit, but in surplus - and, in the year ending June 2001, Australia turned a trade surplus of $0.7 billion. We have become so accustomed to talking about trade deficits in Australia that I would like to re-emphasise that, in the year to 30 June 2001, Australia had a trade surplus of $0.7 billion. The value of goods and services exports were up 13.3 per cent over that year, and in important areas for rural Australia there was strong growth in export income. The value of meat and meat preparations exports grew 29 per cent over the year to 30 June 2001, wool and sheepskin exports grew 31 per cent over the year to 30 June 2001, and service exports grew to be 6½ per cent higher than in June 2000. This was undoubtedly helped by the exchange rate, particularly against the US dollar, which has meant that, notwithstanding a slowing world economy, Australia's exports have grown. In addition, I think we can now say that one of the greatest things that could have been done for Australia's export industry was to take taxes off Australian exports. That could not have been done without tax reform. It was the Australian Labor Party that believed we should tax Australian exporters. If the Australian Labor Party were still in office, Australia's farmers and other exporters would be paying taxes on their exports to compete against others internationally who export into the world tax free.  This was a policy of Labor to export jobs. When we turned around and changed the taxation system, who opposed it? The Australian Labor Party. They never gave Australia's export industries a go. Undoubtedly, the rise in Australia's exports also had a lot to do with making our waterfront more efficient. Once you could get continuity of supply across Australia's waterfront and continuity of supply in relation to exports, Australian exporters were given a much better show on international markets.I was also asked about the state of the economy. I can report to the House that over the last week there have been not only good trade figures but also significant pick-ups in other areas of the economy. Building approvals rose strongly ahead of the GST and fell away sharply thereafter and in July showed another increase of three per cent over June, which was an increase of 24.7 per cent over May. Retail trade for the month of June showed a solid increase of 1.1 per cent in real terms, no doubt fed by lower income taxes paid by ordinary Australian families now having the opportunity to spend more. The ANZ job ads, which were released today, showed that the number of job ads increased two per cent in July. This is fed back into business and consumer sentiment, both recording strong rises in May, June and July - indicative of an economy which is strengthening over the second part of 2001. As reported by, I think, the NAB survey, the Australian economy, in the second part of 2001 and into 2002, is expected to be the fastest growing economy amongst the nations of the developed world. I think that will give pleasure to nearly all Australians who believe that there should be a stronger Australian economy and that we should help exporters. Unfortunately, there are some Australians who took great delight in hoping that the Australian economy would turn down. But the doomsayers were proved wrong: the March quarter was strong, the economy will strengthen in the latter part of 2001 and Australia will be one of the fastest growing developed nations in the world into 2002, which will be good news for Australians and good news for job creation next year.</DOC>

 - I did not mention that, but I also did not mention that the GST tax base will benefit from the exclusion of educational services - the growth in which will be held back by stagnant numbers of age groups in which most education occurs. The reality is that this report - and I am delighted that you have asked me a question about it; it allows me to table it - is not good news and not good reading for the Australian Labor Party. This report demonstrates that the Labor Party was tying itself to a steadily diminishing sales tax base. I hear the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying, `Let's have a debate about tax.' And I say amen to that! By all means, let us have a debate about tax. But, if you are going to have a comprehensive debate about tax, you have to be reminded what Labor stands for. Labor stands for a sales tax. Labor voted against the GST. Labor stood month after month in this chamber and in the Senate and voted to defend the wholesale sales tax system. Incidentally, according to this report - which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition thinks is good news - the sales tax base was some 24.5 per cent of total consumer spending in 1975, it has now declined to 18.4 per cent, and it is projected by Access Economics to have declined to 14.4 per cent of consumer spending by 2030.  What the Labor Party were really saying was that, in government, they would continue to rely on a wholesale sales tax base that was falling in the face of an ageing population and a rise in demand for services. The only result of that, in the absence of a GST, was that you would have to increase income tax. Every road the Labor Party take leads back to higher income taxes under a Labor government. Every single path they point out, every single road they take, leads to the fact that the election of a Labor government means higher income taxes. They defend an indirect tax base that was declining and they attack one that is rising because it is based on a growing economy. They argue that income tax is not too high. They promise to spend more money, to maintain the surplus and to guarantee the state. In the face of all of that, there is only one thing in government you could possibly do, and that is to put up income tax. I table the Access Economics report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question about disputation in the workplace and protection of employee entitlements. I am pleased to tell the House that, in the 12 months to April this year, only 49 working days were lost per 1,000 employees. I am pleased to say that this is the lowest number of days lost since this series was first kept in 1982. On other measures, the level of industrial disputation is the lowest since records were first kept, back in 1913. As members would be aware, there is a very significant industrial dispute going on right now in the motor industry, which has resulted in the stand-down of 12,000 workers. I am afraid that this is a foretaste of what would happen under a Beazley government. Last year the Leader of the Opposition said that Labor would permit industry wide strikes. Under any regime which permits industry wide strikes, the level of industrial disputation would return to the bad old days of the 1970s when Australia was an international bad joke for industrial disputation. I have also been asked about protection of entitlements. Let me make it very clear that this government believes that loss of entitlements is a disaster for the people concerned, and that is why this government has put in place a safety net scheme to protect workers' entitlements. Let me put this matter in context. In any one year, just one-half of one per cent of businesses will go bankrupt and just one-tenth of one per cent of employees will face a possible loss of entitlements. The government's position is that entitlements should be paid, preferably by the employer who owes that entitlement to the worker. But, in the event of a business ceasing to trade and being unable to pay workers' entitlements, this government has put a safety net scheme in place to help. Let me make it very clear that this is the first government in Australia's history to put such a scheme in place. No state Labor government has ever put a scheme in place. The former federal Labor government put no scheme in place, even though they presided over some monumental bankruptcies: the Tricontinental collapse, the Qintex collapse, the Bond Corporation collapse, and the Pyramid Building Society collapse. Throughout 13 years of Labor government, there was no government scheme to protect employee entitlements. I have to say of this government's scheme that it does not encourage people to ramp up their entitlements, but most of all it is a scheme which does not cost jobs - unlike the alternatives on offer. Labor's basic scheme, a 0.1 per cent levy on all payrolls in the country, could cost up to 5,000 jobs. Labor's deluxe scheme, the Manusafe scheme, could cost up to 10,000 jobs in the motor industry alone. So far this government has paid out $9 million under its entitlements scheme to 4,500 workers who have lost entitlements. These workers would have received double that amount if the states had paid their fair share under the government's scheme. If members opposite were really concerned about workers' entitlements, if they really wanted to do the right thing by workers rather than simply make political points and grandstand, they would get on the phone to the state premiers and say, `Don't wait. Do it now - join the federal government's scheme.' </DOC>

 - There is a fundamental difference between the workers at Tristar and the workers that the Leader of the Opposition has referred to. -  - Tristar is a going concern; Tristar is a perfectly good company. Tristar is a company that wants to work and is being prevented from working because of the actions of the people supported by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me make it very clear: this industrial action at Tristar is not about workers' entitlements. The company has offered to protect workers' entitlements. This is not about workers' entitlements; it is about union power. It is about a union controlled fund designed to increase union power.Let it be very clear what the issue is here. This government supports workers' entitlements. Members opposite support union power. This government is opposed to this strike against the national interest. Members opposite do support the strike at Tristar. Members opposite support industrial action which has currently caused 12,000 workers to be stood down. That is what members opposite support. They support workers being forced to stand down. Let me make this clear: there is no legislation in the world that can prevent union bloody-mindedness. But this government will always oppose that kind of behaviour; it will never pander to it, and it will never make excuses for it like members opposite do.</DOC>

 - It is an honour to take a question from the new member for Aston. His predecessor was held in very high esteem in this House. We congratulate the new member on his election and we hope he has a very successful political career. This government believes that for ordinary hardworking decent Australians the income tax rate should be kept as low as possible. That is one of the reasons why this government cut income taxes on 1 July of last year. We cut $12 billion from Australia's income taxes. For people on average earnings - and there would be a lot of them, I think, in the Aston electorate - that means that, instead of having Labor's top marginal rate of 43c in the dollar, under the coalition they face a top marginal rate of only 30c in the dollar. That is 13c in the dollar off that top marginal rate for the average income earner.Indeed, after you take into account the abolition of wholesale sales tax and the abolition of bed tax and their replacement with GST, along with the reductions in personal income tax, the cuts in petrol excise, particularly for transport, the increase in family tax payment A and family tax payment B, the net reduction in the overall tax liability for Australians on 1 July last year was around $6 billion - $6 billion that was returned to the people of Australia. Unfortunately, I must tell the member for Aston that there are some people in this House who think that Australians should be paying higher taxes. As hard as it is to believe, there are people who do not believe in keeping income taxes low for struggling middle income families in Australia. The member for Aston will recall being out at the Knox shopping centre two days before the Aston by-election, when there was an interview with Mr Neil Mitchell of 3AW, who asked the Leader of the Opposition this question:... are they - and he meant Australians - paying too much income tax?Mr Beazley said:No I don't believe so and I will say that with some vigour.So he has finally got vigorous about something. He is vigorous about the fact that Australians do not pay too much income tax. We have heard him be expansive in the past, and we have heard him be prolix, but now he has got vigorous about the fact that people are not paying too much income tax. Of course, if he had his way, they would be paying a lot more income tax. That is what we know.The interesting thing about this vigorous statement on the eve of the Aston by-election was that it was in the wake of a policy which, halfway into question time, we have not heard mentioned yet. It was in the wake of the noodle nation. The Leader of the Opposition during the Aston by-election was going to take the high road of, `What we need is a noodle nation: more spending paid for by more income tax.' He lasted all of about an hour because, after this little debacle on 3AW, remember, he called the press back in and said, no, that was not going to be his policy at all. He is presumably going to fund noodle nation from some other proceeds which are yet to be discovered.Let me tell you why the Labor Party are now in so much trouble on tax: because for the last four years they have been conducting one of the lowest, most populist campaigns imaginable, trying to pretend to the Australian people that the Australian people could have decent social services, whilst opposing a GST and supporting a wholesale sales tax - a wholesale sales tax which all of the developed world has now given up. The Labor Party would have you believe that, along with Swaziland, Australia could be the only country that had a narrow indirect tax base. If we are to have a narrow indirect tax base, the corollary of that is that we must reweight tax out of the indirect tax base to where? There is only one place other than indirect taxes: direct taxes.That was also the statement that the Leader of the Opposition made on the eve of the by-election in Aston. He said, `I believe we should reweight out of indirect tax into direct tax.' Roll-back of GST means rolling up your income tax. That means reweighting out of indirect tax into direct tax. That is just to fund the roll backwards of GST. It is the only political party in the developed world that wants to roll back out of a broad based indirect tax to a narrow based indirect tax system. The consequence of that alone is to roll up income tax. But, when you add into it funding noodle nation and all sorts of other promises that the Labor Party has put out there, it comes back to one proposition, as the Leader of the Opposition said with some vigour: Australians do not pay too much income tax. He thinks they should pay more.This is the reason why `roll-backwards' can never be released. When roll-backwards was first announced, roll-backwards was going to cover everything. We were going to roll backwards right out of a GST and right over to the wholesale sales tax. Roll-backwards has now become the policy which dare not speak its name. We cannot be told where we are going to roll backwards. We cannot be told how much we are going to roll backwards. It disappears by the minute, because we know that the further you roll backwards the more you roll up those income taxes. This is a political party which has turned its face on modernity; it has turned its face on practice right throughout the developed world. It has one spectacle and one spectacle only for Australia: higher taxes on capital, higher taxes on business, fewer jobs and higher income taxes. We on this side of the House believe that ordinary, hardworking, average Australians ought to have lower income taxes, they should get to keep more of what they earn, they should decide where they want to spend it and they should not be funding all of these fantasies of a socialist ALP government. </DOC>

 - The fundamental difference between the matter that the member for Brisbane raises and other matters is that the state Labor government was prepared to be involved. That is the fundamental difference. The only situation of loss of employee entitlements that any state government has been prepared to be involved in was the National Textiles matter. I repeat: workers would receive a much greater share of any entitlements owing to them if the state Labor governments would get involved. I urge the member for Brisbane, if he is really concerned about this, to get on the phone to Bob Carr and tell him to support other situations. That is what Labor members should do: get on the phone to their state colleagues and tell them to back the government's scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. I can understand his concerns because many of his constituents are currently stood down as a result of the strike action at Tristar. Let me make it very clear what the government's position is. We believe that this is a strike against the national interest and that it should end as soon as possible. Mr Speaker, 12,000 workers have already been stood down as a result of this strike, and thousands more will be stood down this week if this strike does not end. Today the government will seek leave to intervene in the Industrial Relations Commission in support of a return to work order if the commission suspends or terminates the bargaining period. We will intervene in this dispute because the 12,000 stood down workers have a right to work. They should not have their right to work taken away by a political strike engineered by an ultramilitant union at a strategic company.The positions of this government and the opposition are very clear. This government opposes the strike at Tristar; the opposition supports the strike at Tristar. But there are some understandable reasons why that would be the case. To start with, last year the AMWU, the union that has pulled on this strike, donated no less than $680,000 to the Australian Labor Party. Not only that; a few weeks ago Doug Cameron, the leader of this strike, promised a half a million dollar marginal seats campaign in support of the Leader of the Opposition. Not only that; the Metal Workers Union has the largest or second largest block vote inside the Australian Labor Party, and the Metal Workers Union's key Victorian activist, the man who controls the largest block vote inside the Labor Party in Victoria, is someone who believes that the best way to talk to small business is to open their front door with a crowbar. Just for once, members opposite should put the national interest ahead of the union interest. The Leader of the Opposition should run his own party rather than let the unions do it for him, because there is one thing that the Australian people are starting to realise: if you are not allowed to govern your own party, you should never be allowed to govern the country. </DOC>

 - Let us make it extremely clear: this strike has been started by the Metal Workers Union. The government did not start this strike. The company did not start this strike. This strike has been started by the Metal Workers Union. It is as simple as that. The only party to this dispute that has completely refused to compromise is the Metal Workers Union. The Metal Workers Union has completely refused to compromise on its absolute insistence on the so-called Manusafe scheme, even though the Manusafe scheme is not a scheme to protect worker entitlements; it is not about protecting existing entitlements; it is about creating new entitlements. What is more, the Manusafe scheme, if it were to come to fruition, would not just be about 1.5 per cent of payroll; it would be about 19 per cent of payroll. That is what it is about. The Manusafe scheme is not at all about protecting worker entitlements; it is about confiscating the working capital of the businesses of Australia. It certainly will not be supported by this government, and it should not be supported by members opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Obviously, with his background of working in this field, he takes a great deal of interest in how Australia's trade performance and our export performance have improved dramatically over the years. Mr Speaker, did you know that the Australian waterfront is now more than 40 per cent more efficient than it was when Keating, Beazley and Crean were running this country? That is an undeniable fact. More and more exporters are telling me as I travel around that that is one of the structural changes that have taken place in this country that have certainly enhanced their businesses and made them more efficient and much more competitive in the international marketplace.Last week the figures for June and, indeed, for the 2000-01 financial year were released. The trade surplus in June stood at $537 million - the fourth in the first half of this year. The trade surplus in the year 2000-01 stands at $707 million, the first annual trade surplus since 1996-97. But more interesting than that is the fact that that is two annual trade surpluses that we have produced since coming into office in 1996. Labor managed just one trade surplus in 13 years in office; we have produced two in almost six years. The one that Labor produced in their 13 years in office was when Labor mugged the economy with interest rates up around 20 per cent, drove consumption down and, of course, `allowed' trade export to exist. At that time it was not about increasing exports, it was not about making the economy more efficient and it was not about making our exporters more competitive in the international marketplace; it was about mugging the economy with high interest rates. The question was: what has contributed to create this circumstance of a trade surplus? It has been increased exports. In the last financial year, $153 billion worth of goods and services were exported out of Australia. Of course, fundamental to that and to the competitive nature of our export industries has been workplace relations reform, particularly on the waterfront. I was in Dubbo last week in the electorate of the member for Parkes. A member of the processing industry there indicated to me that, yes, the economic reforms, the taxation reform, removing $3½ billion off the back of exporters, have been fantastic reforms for Australian exporters. But he said, `The thing that has made my business much, much more competitive is the fact that we changed the workplace relations, particularly on the waterfront and in the workplace.'All those reforms at every inch of the way have been opposed by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party have been opposed to improving the structure of the Australian economy; they have been opposed to taxation reform where we have removed $3½ billion worth of cost burden off the back of Australian exporters; and they have been opposed to the reduction in the level of public sector indebtedness that has certainly helped improve the circumstance and has certainly improved the interest rate regime in Australia. So we have made a much more competitive environment, a much more efficient environment, within Australia so that we can compete better in the international marketplace - and Australia's exporters are taking great advantage of that environment, which has been created by the coalition government.</DOC>

 - The fundamental difference between the government and the opposition on this is that the government supports workers' rights and the opposition supports union rights. That is the fundamental difference. We support the workers of this country. Members opposite just support the unions of this country. Let me make it very clear that the dispute at Tristar is not about legally accrued entitlements; it is about creating new entitlements. It is about putting money into a fund - a union controlled fund - before that money has legally become an entitlement of the workers in question. - Mr Speaker, as you say, the question was about actions going on at the moment inside the motor industry. Let me make it very clear what the distinction between this government and that opposition is. While Labor's mates, while the friends of members opposite, are trying to drive a company out of business and trying to drive an industry to its knees, this government, this Prime Minister, went to Japan to negotiate the arrangement which will secure this industry's future. We are about the future of the motor industry in this country. They are just on about driving companies out of business in support of their union mates. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I have spoken to small businesses in the Corangamite electorate and I know from that visit that the member is a very staunch supporter of small business in those areas. Members of the House would be aware of a proposal by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union to impose a 1.5 per cent payroll levy on the manufacturers to allegedly protect workers' entitlements. Outside the immediate and damaging impact which the proposal will have on the automotive industry, the scheme has significant impact potential on the 86,000 small businesses in manufacturing in Australia. Ninety-three per cent of businesses involved in manufacturing are small businesses, and the AMWU's proposal will impose a significant burden on those small businesses by pinching their capital and putting in place a scheme controlled by the unions.The Australian Industry Group indicates that it is estimated that the Manusafe scheme could cost up to 19.5 per cent extra for the wages bills of companies involved. A 19 per cent increase in the wages bill will cost jobs and it will cost businesses. We know that this scheme will only spread to other businesses and we know that Australian businesses have plenty to fear from a Beazley led, union dominated government because we know that in that scenario what the union wants is what the union gets.We saw a situation the other day where the unions wanted an increase in the superannuation guarantee. Firstly, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said he supported 15 per cent. Then he said no, he did not. Then there was Senator Conroy - who has these fits of honesty - who said he was a 15 per cent man. Lastly, we saw the opposition leader finally admit that because the ACTU wants 15 per cent the Labor Party in government will give workers a 15 per cent superannuation guarantee. Then the Leader of the Opposition wants to use the superannuation guarantee as a discretionary tool to fund his ill-considered workers' entitlements scheme. Small business has a lot to fear from a Labor government. The shadow opposition spokesman on employment admits that this current strike over Manusafe is hurting the car industry but she still continues to support the union. Labor always puts the unions' interest ahead of that of Australia and ahead of that of small business.</DOC>

That is the first point. The second point that I make is that, notwithstanding this action, the government totally supports the Job Network. It is a great scheme, and the people behind it are some of the greatest institutions in our country. Unlike the government, which supports the Job Network, Labor wants to close it down and it snipes at the Job Network at every opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. - I know that the member for Eden-Monaro has a very great interest in that school. In fact, he visited it recently and presented a new Australian flag there. Doubtless, while he was there, the school would have expressed its concern over its entitlement to establishment grants. The October entitlement of the school, of some $17,750 in establishment grants, has now been put at risk by the actions of the Labor Party in the Senate. Lumen Christi Catholic College is one of 54 new schools, generally low-fee schools, whose budgets have been flung into uncertainty by the actions of the Australian Labor Party. It is one of 54 schools, including the Bentleigh Chabad Jewish Day School, the Nykina Mangala Indigenous Community School and the Coast Christian School, to which the government has an obligation to pay establishment grants in October. Unfortunately, the government will not be in a position to make these payments of establishment grants to these schools because the Labor Party voted down in the Senate the legislation which provides the resources for these schools. The Labor Party split the legislation in the Senate. It knows that once the Senate splits legislation from the House of Representatives, that legislation is dead; it never returns to the House of Representatives.None of those schools will be paid unless the Labor Party backs down in its attitude to that legislation. What the Labor Party is now about is attacking schools across the breadth of the non-government sector. It claims that it wants to reduce funding for wealthy schools. In fact, as we know, it is going to cut the funding for some 30 boarding schools that are important to remote and rural Australia. But now it is attacking the funding for low-fee, new schools right across this country. Every one of the two million parents of students at non-government schools will now be in doubt about whether their school will receive cuts in funding under the Labor Party. We know the Labor Party's policy on new schools is just part of its capitulation to the policy of the Australian Education Union. The Australian Education Union - let me be quite clear about it - said in its submission to the Senate last year that the AEU has long opposed any funding to private schools and will continue to do so. As recently as 26 July, Mike Pope, the AEU Tasmanian President, said: The federal government must redistribute the money that is currently going to private schools into the public sector.So the whole $9 billion that is going to be paid to the Catholic parish schools over the next four years is now under attack by the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party has made it clear -  - The Labor Party has made it clear that it is going to rewrite the formula for non-government school funding for the next quadrennium. It has made it quite clear that it is going to reintroduce a new version of its infamous new schools policy, which left many students at low-fee schools unfunded. We know it is going to cut funding to 30 boarding schools, and now in the Senate it is attacking establishment grants to new low-fee schools. This is all because it is seeking to compromise with the extreme policy of the Australian Education Union. It is not a party concerned with educational equity and justice in this country. It is threatening the funding to the whole of the non-government sector by its attitudes, and two million parents are now being left in doubt. The Labor Party is desperate for money. It is going to put up taxes, it is going to put up income taxes, and now we know it is going to slice money away from low-fee non-government schools.</DOC>

 - The essence of the Job Network is that we, the government, do not pay under the Job Network for process; we pay for performance. We pay for people who are placed into jobs. - That is the way the Job Network operates and that is the way it should be. If there are any allegations of dishonesty or inappropriate behaviour, let them be made and they will be investigated, as the allegations in question relating to a Job Network member in Queensland have been investigated and dealt with.The fundamental point is this: this government supports the Job Network. It believes that the Job Network is doing a much better job than the old CES and it is providing much better value for taxpayers. What members opposite want to do is strip the Job Network contracts away from organisations like the Salvation Army, Mission Employment and Centacare. That is what members opposite want to do. They want to destroy the operations of these great companies and go back to a Canberra knows best centralised bureaucracy. It is just not on. It shouldn't happen and this government will never support that kind of betrayal of the jobseekers of Australia, and betrayal of the great organisations that are doing their best to help.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. When this government was elected after 13 years of Labor, around 30 per cent of young Australians could not read or write properly, and, when Kim Beazley was the education minister, he did nothing about this. As he said, `I felt that there was less capacity to achieve in this portfolio than in any other.' - That was his view about a 30 per cent illiteracy rate amongst young Australians. One of the first actions of this government was to put in place a national literacy and numeracy strategy which requires every child in years 3, 5 and 7 to be tested against nationally agreed benchmark standards, and that the states report publicly to parents. The Commonwealth now requires the states, in return for Commonwealth funding, to commit to achieve literacy and numeracy for every child. The legislation recognises, of course, that there will be a very small number of students who will not achieve this.At the ministerial council meeting last Friday week, the state Labor governments attempted to roll back the literacy and numeracy strategy. They made it very clear that they want to repeal the Commonwealth legislation which underpins the right of every young Australian to learn to read and write, to acquire basic literacy and numeracy skills. The Labor states also voted to reject the Commonwealth proposal that they tell parents what their child's performance was against national literacy benchmarks. They refuse to reveal to parents the performance of their child against the national benchmarks. In other words, they refuse to tell parents whether their children can read and write at national standard levels.This is not entirely a surprise from the Labor state governments because the Bracks government in Victoria has backed away from its national commitments on literacy and numeracy; the New South Wales state government has no state target at all for literacy and numeracy; and the Leader of the Opposition has never once criticised any of the unions boycotting literacy and numeracy tests in the states. He never utters a word when thousands of students are disadvantaged and their parents are deprived of vital information.Since this government was elected, the number of Australian students not achieving the national benchmark level has halved. Year 5 data released in the week before last shows a similar trend. Year 5 reading results show that 85.6 per cent of students nationally achieved the agreed minimum national standard. This shows that our strategy is working. The Labor Party is under enormous pressure from the teacher unions to roll back the national strategy. The states are now attempting to do that and they are going to put pressure on the Leader of the Opposition to go along with them. What Australian parents now want to hear is whether Kim Beazley is going to commit himself to the Commonwealth legislation which requires the states to teach every young person to read and write properly.</DOC>

 - I certainly accept that structural factors can cause homelessness. There is no doubt about that. But there are also other factors that can cause homelessness. This government is trying to maximise the opportunities that people have to make the most of their lives. It is about building freedom and opportunities. It is certainly not about trying to enmesh people in suffocating bureaucracy, which is typical of members opposite. The best thing you can do for almost anyone who is suffering deprivation is provide them with a job. The most compassionate thing that you can do for anyone who is suffering deprivation is to provide that person with employment, and I am delighted to say that this government has created 800,000 new jobs since 1996. Not only that, we have boosted the wages of low paid workers. Basic award earnings have gone up by nine per cent over the last five years after declining in real terms by five per cent when members opposite were in government. Average award earnings have gone up by over 10 per cent under this government. In fact, they declined by nearly 15 per cent in real terms when members opposite were in government. So this government have done a magnificent job. We are not perfect and there is always more that can be done. But this government have put in place the foundations which will enable the underprivileged people of this country to make more of their opportunities and we have put in place the kinds of services that they need to make the most of their lives.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He is a great supporter of defence and we have a lot of members on this side who know the importance of defence and are very keen to see it do well in the future. I am asked what the government are doing to support defence. We are implementing the best plan that defence has had in probably 30 or 40 years. We have given to defence a vision and a set of guidelines and real support of the sort which it never had when the Labor Party was in office. I am also asked whether there is a threat to this. There certainly is a threat to the Defence white paper, and that threat sits across the chamber, on the front bench at the bar table - the former Minister for Defence, one of the worst defence ministers Australia has ever had. One only has to mention the Collins class submarines to any audience for most Australians to know that. The Leader of the Opposition has a promise for every audience he meets. He goes to Adelaide and he promises two free new submarines - Kim 1 and Kim 2 - which he will launch if ever he gets in. His shadow minister promises a new boat just at a click of his fingers - $80 million. The Labor Party in Newcastle have got the free bombing range at a mere cost of $1 billion to $2 billion, supported by the Leader of the Opposition. They have got the Anzac battalion - half a billion dollars - and then, just for good measure, he is around Australia promising a coastguard which, when he was the minister, he was totally opposed to because he said it would not work and it would gut the Navy.Then floating onto my desk comes another example of the incoherent incompetence of the Leader of the Opposition. This was a brief discussion by him on Townsville radio. He says:We want to ensure that the government gets the balance right.It is great him giving us advice. And then he goes on that they may be proceeding on the equipment at the expense of members of the armed forces. I thought that he was now promoting the idea that we are spending too much money on equipment and not enough money on personnel. So I kept reading through the transcript and I found that it is not actually that - he wants to spend more money on equipment. We know that, because he has a list as long as your arm - the biggest blank cheque you have ever seen. As the Prime Minister has said, all roads lead back to a certain proposition. On Townsville radio last month Mr Beazley said that he was now not talking about cutting the defence budget at all: the Labor Party was going to increase it. So now we have from the Labor Party the biggest surplus, the biggest spending, the promise to the states, noodle nation, and it is going to spend more money on defence. And, of course, he says, `You will be told what we are going to spend it on after the election.'  Senator Conroy gave us a glimpse. When you put all of these bits of the puzzle together, they add up to one extra thing: there will be nothing for defence. People in defence will pay more income tax. That is what they ought to be worried about.</DOC>

 - In response to the question, I do not know anything about an operating fund. As to the $18,000, I was asked about that after the program went to air and that was the first I had heard of it. As to allegations of illegality, I think even a spokesman for the New South Wales Attorney-General, Bob Debus, has said that it is not impossible - he may have even gone a little stronger than that and said that it is not unlikely - that the documents referred to in that program were in fact documents that were obtained perfectly legally from parties to the litigation. But as to the behaviour of Senator Heffernan, I have full confidence in him and no allegations of impropriety have been made against him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question and I appreciate her deep concern to protect the entitlements of workers in her electorate. Let me say that this government is deadset against strikes which cause tens of thousands of Australians to be denied their right to work. But we are also absolutely committed to ensuring that Australian workers get their due, that Australian workers get their entitlements. That is why this is the first government in Australian history to put in place a government scheme to protect workers' entitlements. No state Labor government has ever put a scheme in place. The former federal Labor government, in which the Leader of the Opposition served as a minister for 13 years, did not put a scheme of entitlements in place, even though tens of thousands of workers lost their entitlements when the Leader of the Opposition was a minister in a government. Thanks to this government's scheme, when businesses close down and cannot pay their employees their entitlements, the federal government is there to help. So far under the government's scheme some $9 million has been paid out to some 4½ thousand workers who have lost their entitlements. Unlike any other scheme that has been proposed, this scheme, the federal government's scheme, is not a tax on jobs. There is nothing at all wrong with the federal government's scheme except that, so far, states have not been prepared to pay their fair share under it. But I am delighted to say that, as of today, the South Australian government has announced that it is joining the federal scheme. What that means is that workers in South Australia whose employers cannot pay their entitlements will get twice as much as workers in Labor states. I do not want that to be the case and there is a simple way for this anomaly to be fixed, and that is for the Labor states to join the federal government's scheme.Ever since the federal government announced its scheme, Labor has been playing catch-up politics. I accept that the federal government's scheme is not Labor's preferred model; I accept that it is not what they would like. But it is the only scheme in place and it is helping workers now. Just because it was not Labor that thought of it first is no reason for Labor to continue to deny workers their maximum entitlements under the federal government's scheme. I ask members opposite, in the interests of workers in need, to tell their state Labor colleagues to support the federal government's scheme.</DOC>

 - I will seek from the Leader of the Opposition some further details of this gentleman's entitlements before I can make a judgment without that information as to whether the figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition are in fact accurate. I would like to know what component of that -  - I am not suggesting that it is not possible for somebody to accrue at the time of redundancy -  - The Leader of the Opposition assists me by interjecting and reminding me that this gentleman has been employed by Tristar for 30 years. But I can be absolutely certain, in advance of receiving that information, of one unassailable fact: he will at the very worst be $20,000 better off than he would have been under Labor. I can be absolutely certain about that because when the Labor Party was in government they cared so little about the entitlements of workers that they were not prepared in 13 years to implement any kind of scheme. The last person who can come to the dispatch box with clean hands on this issue is the Leader of the Opposition, because the Leader of the Opposition had 13 years to do something. The reality is that we have instituted a scheme.The first observation I would make is to remind the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, to remind other people who are following this matter that, to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, the Tristar company is trading quite profitably - and after all the comments that have been made by Doug Cameron, aided by Kim Beazley, who tried hard to talk down the company commercially. I ask the House to contemplate the impact on a company of the strike, a strike that was not condemned by the Leader of the Opposition. The strike was never condemned by the Leader of the Opposition and the strike has done damage to the company. Indeed, it has not aided the future prospects of the gentleman referred to by the Leader of the Opposition in his question.The other observation that I make is that it may be - and I will stand corrected if the figures demonstrate otherwise - that part of the entitlement to that $130,000 is predicated on the gentleman being made redundant. People are not normally made redundant by profitable companies and I would hope -  - The Leader of the Opposition -  - is asking us to accept -  -   - I repeat what I said about the calculation: it may well be - and I stand corrected if the Leader of the Opposition can produce some figures that establish otherwise - that a large proportion of that $130,000 is predicated on a redundancy. The entitlement to a redundancy payment - and this is a point missed in the whole of the debate - does not arise until the act of redundancy takes place. It is not something that accrues legally in the same way as long service leave or holiday pay; it is on a completely different legal basis. As somebody who sat on the front bench of the government for 13 years and did nothing about workers' entitlements, the Leader of the Opposition does not come to this debate with any credibility at all. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question and for his concerns in these areas. Let me make it very clear that this government believes that workplace relations are fundamentally a matter for negotiation between managers and workers at an enterprise level, or even at an individual level. If negotiations break down it is important to have an umpire - not an umpire of first resort but an umpire of last resort - to ensure that disputes in our workplace do not damage the national interest. Let me make it very clear that this government fully supports the role of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to set award safety nets, to approve and mediate certified agreements, and to perform all the other important tasks that it has under the Workplace Relations Act. In fact, under the pattern bargaining legislation that is currently stalled in the Senate, this government would have given the Industrial Relations Commission additional powers to order a cooling-off period in the event of damaging industrial disputes.This government is determined to do the right thing by the workers of Australia. Thanks to this government's policy, I am very pleased to say that workers' wages are up and industrial disputation is down, because strikes cost jobs. This government stands foursquare for the workers of Australia, and I am afraid to say that the opposition over there stands foursquare for the unions. Do not take my word for it; I am quoting from the Labor Party's official web site run off today, 7 August, which says:A vital part of the Party's rebuilding process has been to maintain and extend our special relationship with our union affiliates with whom we share much in common.The Labor Party's official document goes on to say:The unions have always been an important source of funds and other resources which keep the party functioning.Too right they have been! I have a list here of union donations to the Labor Party in just one year, 1999-2000. The Health Employees Association gave $234,000. The Australian Services Union gave $258,000. The Electrical Trades Union gave $277,000. The communications union gave $341,000. The Transport Workers Union gave $376,000. Our old mates the CFMEU gave $402,000. The miscellaneous workers union - the union which the Leader of the Opposition belongs to - gave $456,000, and the `shoppies' gave $523,000. The Australian Workers Union gave $653,000 and the AMWU - Dougie Cameron's union - gave $680,000 in just one year. It is no wonder that the only roll-back that the Leader of the Opposition has been prepared to explain has been the roll-back of the government's industrial relations reform. The Leader of the Opposition will abolish workplace agreements, he will abolish the Employment Advocate, he will allow industry-wide strikes - a stoppage in one factory will stop all factories - and he will exempt unions from the operations of the secondary boycott provisions. This is not cash for comment; this is cash for policy - cash that the unions are paying to buy the policy of the Australian Labor Party. The unions might be able to buy the Australian Labor Party but they never should be allowed to buy the Australian government. </DOC>

 - The government's scheme is fully funded in the forward estimates. The difference between our scheme and the various proposals emanating from members opposite is that our scheme is not a tax on jobs. That is the beauty of our scheme: it protects entitlements but it does not cost jobs; it is not a tax on jobs. Members opposite are only too well aware that the proposals they are putting forward are a tax on jobs. A former adviser to the Leader of the Opposition, John Angley, wrote that a compulsory levy or tax would be `another cost on jobs'. This is the Leader of the Opposition's own adviser saying it would be another cost on jobs. He said:It also reduces the responsibility of employers/owners to fix their own affairs rather than fall back on the fund.That is the compulsory, centralised fund. This government has done the right thing by the workers of Australia. It has done the right thing protecting their entitlements and the right thing protecting their jobs. The best thing that members opposite could do would be to ask their state Labor colleagues to join the government's entitlements scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. Of interest to the member for La Trobe would be the fact that 40 per cent of Australia's Holden Commodores, in terms of content, were actually manufactured in the Bayswater Hallam area in the member's electorate. Obviously this industry, particularly the export component of this industry, is vitally important to him. More good news - and I am sure the House and the nation will welcome the news - is that in the financial year just concluded Australian automotive exports reached a record of $4.65 billion. It is interesting to compare that in the last years of a Labor government in 1995 the automotive exports out of Australia were only $0.94 billion, or $940 million. That is an enormous increase over the last six years, and an increase of 23 per cent in the last 12 months. Since Labor was last in office there has been a 395 per cent increase in exports of automotive products out of Australia. Fully built up vehicle exports increased 41 per cent in the last financial year. The Labor Party completely ignored the market that we have established in the Middle East. - You did not export a car to the Middle East until we came to office. - No, you did not export a car to the Middle East. - The Labor Party in government ignored this market. Over $1.2 billion worth of vehicles were exported to Saudi Arabia alone in the last 12 months. In 1995 there were no cars sold in Saudi Arabia originating from Australia. That is Labor's record in this particular area. Exports of automotive products are now ranked as the sixth largest export from Australia, ranking ahead of traditional export commodities such as wheat, wool and beef. These are smart exports. The auto sector are ahead of the Labor Party; they do not need the noodle nation that is being proposed by the Labor Party. They are ahead of the Labor Party in the technology and the intellectual property they have developed in that industry with the support of our government. What puts this at risk - and the parliament would recognise this - is the action that is being taken by the AMWU in terms of closing down the Australian automotive manufacturing sector, which has established a fantastic record in the international marketplace for quality and consistency in supply in that marketplace. The actions of the AMWU, in terms of Tristar and what is happening right through the automotive industry, are going to give that industry a bad name internationally.We have called upon the union and their leader, Dougie Cameron, who is absolutely haunting the Australian Labor Party in a number of different ways. Remember the debate that you had to have with Dougie down in Hobart at the biennial conference? We remember Dougie's actions in Seattle. We remember which side of this issue he stood on in Seattle, and your colleagues had to try and pull him into gear. Dougie Cameron was reported in the Australian today as saying that, after 13 years of Labor in office, he came to the realisation that the union movement should no longer be an appendage of the Labor Party. His view now is that the Labor Party should be an appendage of the union movement. We know that is a fact. So, on the back of those great export figures, it is time that the leadership of the Labor Party called on the union movement to get these industries back to work, to secure the jobs of those auto workers and to secure Australia's place in the international automotive market with those great export figures that we have produced in the last 12 months.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. I think he would agree, as most people on this side of the House would agree, that one of the best things you can do for young Australian families is to help them buy their own home. I know that has been very important in the electorate of Parramatta, and I know that the new member for Aston will agree also that helping families with their homes, giving them that secure base, is one of the best things you can do to help Australians and their children. This government has recently put in place a First Home Owners Scheme which gives people who have not owned a home before a grant of up to $14,000 for the construction of a new home. The grant can be used for any purpose, such as payment of mortgage, payment of deposit or maybe even fitting out some of the goods or chattels in that new home. The total value of grants paid to first home owners in 2000-01 was $1,057 million - that is $1,057 million out to the home buyers of Australia.The second thing that you can do to help people buy homes is to get their income taxes down. We have not heard any questions about income taxes today from the Labor Party; we have gone off that issue. If it had not been for tax reform, a person on average wages in Australia, at $42,000 per annum, would now be on a marginal income tax rate of 43 cents in the dollar. Under Labor you would be paying 43 cents in the dollar for every extra dollar that you earned on average wages. Tax reform brought that down, and it brought it down to 30 per cent. So 80 per cent of Australians pay a marginal income tax rate of no higher than 30 per cent. Of course, that is why they are worried about this roll-backwards, which means roll up the income taxes right back to where the Labor Party had them.Perhaps the best thing you can do for home buyers in Australia is have a policy of low interest rates. When this government was elected, interest rates on a home were 10½ per cent; today they are 6.8 per cent. The average Australian loan today is $130,000. This means that, from the time this government was elected to today, on the average Australian loan you pay $4,810 per year less in interest - that is $400 per month on the average Australian loan compared to 1996. If you want to go back to when the Labor Party last held the seat of Aston - and I know the honourable member for Aston used this to great effect during the Aston by-election - and interest rates were 17 per cent per annum, on the average Australian loan you were paying $1,105 per month extra of after tax money. Imagine paying $1,100 per month extra of after tax money on a marginal rate of 43c. You would have to earn $2,000 a month to put yourself back in that same position; that means a second job.The findings of the Ashe Morgan Winthrop group, which were released yesterday, said that the federal home grants were driving the housing market in the smaller states. Ashe Morgan Winthrop said that the federal government first home buyers grants were driving growth in residential development in states such as South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland. It said that property investors in the larger states of New South Wales and Victoria tend to view the stimulatory effects of continuing low interest rates as the primary factor in their markets. So what can you do for Australian families to help them get on with their lives, look after their children and realise their ambitions? Provide lower income taxes, the first home buyers grants and lower interest rates - that is the most direct, practical way of helping Australia's young families that has yet been put into place.</DOC>

 - I will check the quote, because I do not take anything that the Labor Party says at face value. I am interested in all small businesses in Australia, and I am concerned if any small business has found the last 12 months to be difficult. But it is interesting, when you look at the insolvency data and you talk to ITSA, that in ITSA's discussions with those businesses not one of them mentioned the GST as being the reason for their insolvency.The shadow minister also quoted figures relating to retail trade. Retail trade in June showed a solid increase of 1.1 per cent, but for small business it was a growth of 5.9 per cent. The reality is that the economy of Australia continues to grow - and continues to grow, in the estimation of overseas bodies, at the fastest rate in the world. In the last 12 months, during which we have had a GST, our economy has become the fastest growing economy in the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. I have to say that I do not think any of us anticipated just how well received the Roads to Recovery program would be. - It was a very good program, yes. I hear somebody over there calling it a pork barrel; that, I think, is the sort of everyday word for boondoggle. But the interesting thing about this program is that out there, regardless of political persuasion, people in local communities right across Australia think it has been a tremendous thing. Indeed, we announced it in November last year and started making payments in February this year. We then offered accelerated payments for councils that wanted to really get on with it, and that has been very popular indeed. We put out $152 million in total, but of that around $70 million has been in accelerated payments, because there were councils everywhere that had work backed up that really needed to be done.Councils that had work backed up that really needed to be done included such places as the Brisbane City Council. I do not think they are necessarily aligned with the side of politics that I represent, but they are very keen. They have claimed some $18 million in payments, $16 million of it as accelerated payments. I assume that they are not unrealistic enough to think that their mates might see to a change of government and that it was necessary for them to get in first. I can assure them - and I can assure all councils - that this is an ongoing commitment where they can phase their expenditure as they need it. There is no doubt that the program is fulfilling exactly the role that we intended for it.We have done a preliminary study. It shows that, of a total value of projects submitted by 30 June, 44 per cent was being put towards reconstruction, rehabilitation and widening; 30 per cent was being used for regravelling, sealing and resealing work; and a further 13 per cent was going to bridge, drainage and traffic improvements. Right across Australia, whether it is with people in remote parts of the country having better and, hopefully, all-weather access to their schools or their doctor or being able to carry out their social lives, or whether it is with improved safety and amenity in urban areas, this is obviously a very valuable program indeed.I was asked about alternative views - and we got one pronunciation over here on that subject. But I also had a bit of a look at this very interesting page: Australian Labor Party, `Kim Beazley's Policy Page'.  -  - Yes, there is. It has `Kim Beazley's Plan For Our Country'. I can tell you that there is not much for the country with a big `C' and even less for the country with a little `c' in it. Under the heading `The details of Kim's priorities' what I particularly noticed is that they seem to have a real problem with words that begin with `R'. There is not much about rural, there is not much about regional, there is not much about remote, there is nothing about roll-back and there is nothing that I can see about roads. I do note that my opposite number, the member for Batman, was given an opportunity to comment on at least one `R', railways, and that was for the Financial Review. The Financial Review writes:But the subject of rail reform is one that seems to have eluded the ALP's transport spokesman, Martin Ferguson, who declined to be interviewed.I have never heard of an opposition spokesman declining to be interviewed, but the member for Batman declined to be interviewed. The Financial Review article went on to say:Despite several years with responsibility for the portfolio -  - People right across Australia are interested to know whether this valuable local program will continue. As I have said, the Financial Review reported:Despite several years with responsibility for the portfolio, Ferguson declined to outline a single initiative developed in opposition, or comment directly on any feature of the opposition's transport agenda.To conclude, for what it is worth, the article went on to say very insightfully in relation to Mr Ferguson:His current vow of silence does little to explain how he would address transport issues.</DOC>

 - Unlike the Labor Party, I spend a lot of my time out amongst small businesses. In the last weeks of the recess, I spent a great deal of time talking to small businesses. What small businesses are telling me is that they knew we had to have tax reform. That is what they are telling me. They knew we had to have tax reform and they accept, as we accept, that it has been a difficult 12 months for small business. But during that time, as a result of our discussions with small business, we have introduced a number of refinements to the process that have been well received. On 22 February, we introduced changes to the BAS process, which allowed businesses to go on an estimates method. There are other refinements to that process. Since then, of course, we have introduced a simplified BAS form more tailor-made to the individual business. Small businesses say to me that the thing they fear most about any further changes is roll-back. Roll-back is the thing that small businesses are most worried about changing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin. I can inform her that under the way in which the Commonwealth now reports in its budget, we have made light years of progress against the sordid and sorry tale of our predecessors, the Australian Labor Party. One of the things that the government does now is publish a measures document with every budget. It sets out every measure that the government has taken in relation to revenue and expenses. In addition to that, there was never a budget paper of measures prior to the election of this government. The government did not report the individual measures that it had taken in relation to revenue and expenses. There was no Budget Paper No. 2 in relation to budget measures.In addition to that, under the Charter of Budget Honesty the government is obliged to report a mid-year review with measures taken between the budget and the mid-year, an update of all economic forecasts and budget projections out over the four-year forward estimates. That is the most recent mid-year review for 2000-01. Now I want to show the House the last mid-year review that was prepared before our election: two pages! Not only did it not have any measure -  not one single measure that had been taken by the government - but it did not have four-year forward estimates and it did not have a budget position. Not only was the mid-year review of December 1995 laughable by its size, it was laughable by its content. The mid-year review of the Labor Party - two pages compared with what we do now - had this for the 1995-96 mid-year review estimate of the budget position: surplus $115 million. - I table the outcome for the year after six months, the actual outcome -  - Remember what they said: surplus $115 million. I table the outcome six months later: deficit $10,077 million. They were only out by $10,000 million. The finance minister at the time was the man who interjects loudly in his own defence, the now Leader of the Opposition. He was the man who, during that election campaign, as late as March claimed that the budget was in deficit. -   - Claimed the budget was in surplus; I stand corrected. When we were elected, the Prime Minister and I remember the Monday after the election when the Treasury came to us and said, `Sorry about that surplus claim.' We were then $8,000 million in deficit, finishing by June at $10,077 million in deficit. That is why the Charter of Budget Honesty was introduced. The Charter of Budget Honesty was introduced in this country to make sure that nobody could ever again try to do what Kim Beazley did in the 1996 election.The Charter of Budget Honesty, which has to be released during the campaign, is a statement from the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration, and it works like this: if a government tried to cook a budget figure in the way that Mr Beazley tried to cook a budget figure during the election campaign, an independent audit would find them out. So you cannot cheat in the way that Mr Beazley cheated in 1996. The Charter of Budget Honesty ought to be called the `charter of Beazley honesty'; that is what it should have been called - the `charter of Beazley honesty' -  to make sure nobody could ever again try to do what he did in the 1996 election. - The `charter of the honourable member for Fremantle honesty' - that is what it ought to be called. What is he? The honourable member for Brand.  -  - We will brand him all right, Mr Speaker. We will brand him honourably as the author of the Charter of Budget Honesty. The Charter of Budget Honesty was introduced as an independent statement by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration to make sure that nobody could ever cheat again in the way that the member for Brand did in the 1996 election - so that it could never be done again. That means that the Commonwealth budget position, as updated by the midyear review, I think in every year of our government has come in with a better bottom line - never with a $10 billion hole driven right through the middle of it. Now, of course, the author of the 1996 deceit says that he cannot release his policies because he has to wait for the Charter of Budget Honesty, which by law must be released during an election campaign - by law. It is an independent statement. So what does he now say? He cannot have any policies until 10 days into the election campaign. I have never seen a political party run from its own policies in the way the Labor Party does. For 5½ years, we heard about the noodle nation. We have been back here two days; have we had one question about the noodle nation? For 3½ years we heard that the GST was awful and we had to roll backwards, but we cannot hear one detail about rolling backwards, because the Australian Labor Party is so ashamed of its policy. When the shadow minister for small business gets up, he cannot even talk about the roll-back word. He now has to talk about `complexity' or use some other nom de plume for roll-back.The Charter of Budget Honesty makes sure that this government's accurate budget statements cannot be fiddled in the way in which Mr Beazley fiddled the 1996 midyear report. It ensures that the Commonwealth account is clean. It ensures that we have measures over the full four years. It ensures that we update the forecast. It ensures that we have projections out over the four-year period. The hiding of the Leader of the Opposition against the Charter of Budget Honesty, a measure which has cleaned up the accounts immeasurably and which has ended his deceit, is nothing but a subterfuge for a man who has no policy and who has no credibility in relation to policy. - </DOC>

 - I am a bit perplexed by the last question because the shadow minister said that we were doing nothing on the BAS simplification, but in my last answer I outlined what we were doing and what we had already done. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects about what needs to be done. It is interesting to note that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put forward a proposal in May this year with much fanfare about how he was going to simplify the BAS process and that it would be a huge step forward for GST simplicity, and he was backed by the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for small business. He said that the method would `eliminate the need for an annual reconciliation'. Sitting in this chair one day, I asked the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to explain to me how he could reconcile -   - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did explain to me that you could put a system in place without an annual reconciliation. As I said, he was backed by his shadow minister. The interesting thing is that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the same policy. The interesting thing is that the Leader of the Opposition said in Townsville on 23 July, while attempting to explain Labor's proposed changes to BAS:What we have suggested is a process whereby you have an annual reconciliation of your GST payments ...Was that a mistake? - Perhaps it was. But 10 days later on ABC radio Mr Beazley was again asked what roll-back would mean for small business. But, of course, when you ask them that question they have nowhere to go. They do not know what roll-back means for small business. They do not understand what small business is about, by their own admission: on 6PR the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, `Labor is not the party for small business.' - Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I was just saying that, in terms of the simplification that is being offered by the opposition as part of this so-called roll-back, Mr Beazley said on 3AK yesterday -  - What does it have to do with the question? - The point is that what we have on this side is a complete vacuum of policy in relation to tax simplification. -  - We have a set of policies in which the shadow Treasurer disagrees with the shadow leader. In terms of what we have done on BAS, our record is confirmed; it is on the ground.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. I am aware of the situation of the Jubilee Primary School. Jubilee Primary School is a new Catholic primary school in the electorate of Forde, which is entitled to establishment grants under legislation that has already passed through the Commonwealth parliament. Jubilee Primary School is now overdue for payment of $26,760 in establishment grants. This payment cannot be made by the Commonwealth government at the moment, although the school is entitled to it, because the Labor Party has voted down in the Senate funding for establishment grants for new schools, including new Catholic parish schools, including Christian community schools -  - The Jubilee Primary School is unable to receive its payment because the Labor Party has voted down in the Senate funding for establishment grants for new schools. There are now some five schools that have not received the payments to which they are entitled, as a result of the Labor Party's action. In October another 54 schools will fail to get these payments unless the Leader of the Opposition backs down on his determination to deprive these schools of their legislatively entitled funding. The fact that these schools are missing out is not the result of some unforeseen consequence. The Labor Party was told that this would be the consequence of its actions. The Senate committee was advised of this, but still the Leader of the Opposition authorised the Labor Party in the Senate to continue to oppose this legislation, and it did so. It split the legislation and killed the bill. How is the member for Dickson explaining to the 120 parents of students at the Living Faith Lutheran Primary School why Labor has prevented their school getting $8,500? How is the member for Melbourne Ports explaining his decision to risk payments of $16,000 to Alia College? This school is now the seventh school on the Beazley hit list in the electorate of Melbourne Ports. How is the member for Perth explaining his decision to put at risk payments of $6,750 to the Casa Mia Montessori Community School? How is the member for Greenway explaining his decision to the Allaowera Christian School? And how is the member for Hotham explaining his decision to put at risk the funding for the Bentleigh Chabad Jewish Day School?Labor's hit list of schools is growing all the time. It is quite clear that the Leader of the Opposition is not concerned with cutting funding just to rural boarding schools that he says are rich schools; he is now attacking all new schools. The funding for all new schools is under threat as a result of the decisions of the Leader of the Opposition. He is attacking funding to the Catholic parish schools, he is attacking funding to community schools; he is even threatening the $9,000 payment to the Nyikina Mangala Aboriginal community school in the Kimberley. The question just has to be asked: does the Leader of the Opposition now understand why he has no credibility in education whatever and why `noodle nation' got the reception it deserved?</DOC>

 - Why would you adopt any plan that the Labor Party have for small business - perhaps one that they used when they were last in power? Perhaps one they used when interest rates were 22 per cent? Perhaps one that would drive interest rates to the point where business would pay another $1,000 a month in interest over what they are paying now? Perhaps one which would drive the economy into recession? Perhaps one that would continue to load the cost onto small business as they earn their living, not when they make their profit? The only policy that Labor have on small business is roll-back, and we cannot get a consistent theme out of them on what roll-back means. We know one reason why we will never adopt roll-back: small business have made it emphatically clear that they do not want roll-back under any circumstances.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. Tonight is census night. It is the first census of the new century, it marks our 100 years as a nation and it is the first census of a new millennium. We call on all Australians to participate in the census tonight. It represents 30 minutes of time and effort filling out the form every five years. The Commonwealth government is spending $240 million on the census tonight, employing 30,000 people to obtain and process information from over nine million households across Australia. The information is used for planning, research, administration, policy development and program monitoring. Australia has had an excellent record completing the census since the first census was undertaken on a national basis in 1911. The census is completed by 98.5 per cent of Australians, which is the second highest completion rate in the world, after New Zealand. For the first time, this year questions will include usage of technology issues, covering personal computer usage and Internet usage, and this will provide a snapshot that will assist with infrastructure planning for years to come. Also for the first time, Australians may elect to have their information kept for 99 years. This is a response to the Andrews committee, a parliamentary committee which recommended in 1998, in a report titled Saving our census and preserving our history, that the opt-in approach be available to Australians so that Australians could have the information locked away for future generations.The member for Kooyong asked me how this information will be used. It will be overlaid on existing information, and it will provide a complete picture of how Australia looks as a nation in the year 2001. I have compared it to previous snapshots over the last eight census periods, starting in 1961. If you compare our nation today with other census years, it is a great story - and it is getting better. For a standard home loan today, under the Howard government, interest rates are only 6.8 per cent, which is the lowest level since the 1966 census, when they were 5.38 per cent. In census year 1986, under the Labor Party, interest rates reached their highest level of 15.5 per cent. Similarly for small business, in 1986 interest rates hit their all-time peak of 17.4 per cent, followed by 14.4 per cent in 1991, compared with eight per cent today - the lowest level since comparable records have been kept.Unemployment, at 6.9 per cent today, is at its lowest census year level since 1981, when we were last in government, when it was 5.8 per cent. Government debt in the 1981 census year was $6½ billion. At the 1996 census, it hit the high-water mark of $96 billion compared with the reduction to $43 billion in just five years. For the average household, a local telephone call today, under the Howard government, costs 22c compared with 25c in 1996 under Labor. For international phone calls it is much cheaper. In 1991, under Labor, a phone call to the United Kingdom cost $1.49 a minute. Today, under the coalition, it costs 37c a minute. We want as many Australians as possible to tick question 50 to have their census information kept for 99 years in ASIO approved security at the National Archives. We want top security, because we want all Australians to see how much has been achieved over the last five years since the last census and, importantly, how the Howard government has prepared Australia for the challenges of the new millennium.</DOC>

 - One thing that small business can be sure of with a coalition government is that we are going to maintain our budget surpluses. We are going to do that to ensure that interest rates remain low, because the single biggest issue for small business is low interest rates. Mr Speaker, you have just heard about the difference between a coalition government and a Labor government. Labor governments are high taxing, high spending governments that increase interest rates and drive small businesses to the wall.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Hughes. I take the opportunity to congratulate her for giving her time to go out with the construction unit in the Northern Territory to support the work that they are doing in building housing for Aboriginal communities, which is one of the great things that the Army does and I would like to see them get more credit for it. I was very pleased to see the honourable member out there with them in the last week or so.I am pleased to answer her question by saying that the Defence budget will grow by an average of three per cent in real terms over the coming decade. This is a real commitment to Defence. Importantly, not only does it provide the resources but also it provides a plan within which Defence as an organisation can modernise itself and bring itself to very high standards operationally and in terms of its management. I am asked whether or not there are any alternative proposals. There certainly are alternative proposals. There are proposals for two new subs: Kim 1 and Kim 2. There is a proposal for a bombing range. - Oh, and you had the catamaran -  - Mr Speaker, I answer questions on the Labor Party's policy on the basis of what they say publicly. Yesterday I referred the House to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition in Townsville acknowledged that his promises for Defence would cost more money. After I had said that he had acknowledged that they would need to spend more money, he got up at the end of question time and made this statement:He - `he' being Peter Reith - said that I would increase defence spending, and then he left it at that. That is a partial quote which misleads. Those are the comments of the Leader of the Opposition. There was no misleading of the Leader of the Opposition. What he said is in fact available on the Labor Party's own web site. There was no partial exposition by me of what he said. What he said was quite specific. This is the sentence:So I am not talking about cutting the Defence budget at all.Then he said:Paradoxically, what we intend to do with the coastguard will probably increase it.You said that you were going to increase defence spending. - Exactly. Yesterday, after question time, the Leader of the Opposition got up and said I was misleading. - I understand exactly what you mean. Mr Speaker, I will tell you what he means: when he is in Townsville, he has a message for the people in Townsville, and when he is in Canberra he has a different message. The consequence of what he told the people in Townsville is that they will have to pay higher income taxes for the whole list of promises that the Labor Party has. You cannot promise Kim 1 and Kim 2, a free bombing range, the Anzac battalion and a coastguard that you were opposed to when in government and then say -  - Having alleged yesterday that the Labor Party acknowledged that they would have to spend more, I am criticised by the Leader of the Opposition for misleading, and here he is today accepting the first proposition that I made. The shadow minister says, `We're not going to buy a catamaran' - the Jervis Bay replacement - but he put out a press release saying that he was going to do so at a cost of $80 million. He can have 101 interjections while I am answering a question, but there are questions to be answered on Labor's defence policy, and it is about time they fronted up - </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, as you are aware -  -  - I do not actually need the brief. Mr Speaker, as you are aware -  - As you would be aware, I have been out talking with small business during the recess of parliament. When you sit down at a roundtable, at a morning tea or at a lunch, the single issue that continues to rise to the top, first up, on industrial relations is unfair dismissal. The shadow minister knows it is an issue for small business - he has said so. We have given those sitting opposite eight opportunities to give small business a big start, in terms of amendments to unfair dismissal legislation, and on eight occasions they have put unions before small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page, whose farmers are amongst those around Australia who have contributed mightily to Australia's balance of trade surplus over the past 12 months. They have been able to do that because this government has delivered the sort of policy framework and environment under which farmers can prosper. Quite a lot of statistics have been released over recent times, including ABARE forecasts about likely returns to the farm sector in the year ahead. There is a lot of good news for the farmers in the electorate of Page and indeed right around Australia from those statistics. The net value of farm production is forecast to rise by 16 per cent in 2001-02, and that follows a 34 per cent rise in the previous financial year. The gross value of farm production will be up, due largely to improved prices for commodities such as wheat, beef, oil seeds, sugar and, in spite of what you might read in the media, most dairy products. The prospect for improved prices for farmers is certainly quite bright. The other good news is that, for the second year in a row, farmers' terms of trade are predicted to improve - in other words, the difference between the income received by farmers and the prices that they pay. This sort of good news simply could never have happened under Labor. This improvement in farmers' terms of trade - their lower cost rises - has been achieved very much by the policy framework put in place by this government.Just look, for instance, at interest rates. Interest rates are half what they would have been under a Labor government; half what they were under Labor - a very substantial saving to farmers. Four billion dollars have been taken off the taxes paid by our exporters as a result of tax reform: it could never have happened under Labor. What about the freezing of fuel excise and the reduction in excise prices? It is interesting to note that 1 August this year is the first time since Labor that there has been no increase in the fuel excise. Fuel excise did not go up. This government froze excise, and we also reduced significantly the cost of the taxation on a whole lot of transport fuel, the fuel used by farmers. That could never have happened under Labor. What about, for that matter, the competitive dollar? That could never have happened under Labor's high interest rate policy. What about, for instance, the improvement on the wharves? There has been a significant cost reduction to our exporters because our wharves have become much more efficient. That sort of thing could simply have never happened under Labor. Then there is the fact that this government has helped industry take control of its own destiny in industries like wool, pigs, grain and horticulture as well. All of that has helped farmers take control of their destiny and improve their terms of trade.None of this could ever have happened under Labor because Labor do not care about a productive rural sector. All they are interested in from farmers is higher taxes. Labor want unions controlling the waterfront so that produce cannot get to our vital export markets. They have no interest in the rural sector. Farmers need a coalition government to deliver continuing improvement in their terms of trade.</DOC>

 - In reply to the honourable member for Hume, my attention has been drawn to the report of the National Crime Authority, and I take this opportunity of totally rejecting the suggestion raised by the Chairman of the National Crime Authority that consideration be given to a heroin trial. It remains the policy of this government to totally oppose heroin trials in this country. We will give no aid, comfort or any encouragement to any state or territory. I believe that those who advocate heroin trials are misguided. I do not accept the analysis that the measures that have been taken in recent years to increase the capacity of the law enforcement authorities to tackle the drug problem have failed to bear fruit. The report ignores the commitment of over $500 million made by this government to Tough on Drugs, which funds a three-pronged approach to fighting the drug menace through greater resources for law enforcement, education and treatment. Our law enforcement efforts against drugs are already paying off. Federal agencies have seized, over the past four years, 1,694 kilograms of heroin, 2,650 kilograms of cocaine and 697 kilograms of ecstasy. Seizures and arrests have contributed to the disruption and dismantling of major heroin importation and distribution networks. I take the opportunity of recording my thanks to the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service and the police services of the various states of Australia, which have cooperated so effectively with the federal authorities. Although it is far too early to make any exaggerated claims in relation to evidence of reduction in deaths from heroin overdose, it is nonetheless encouraging to note that this year in the state of Victoria the number of deaths from heroin overdose has been 29, compared with a figure of 150 over an equivalent period last year. I stress that, although it would be unwise to exaggerate, it is encouraging. One of the reasons for this claimed by the Australian Federal Police, and it tends to pass the test of commonsense, is that the law enforcement activities have had an effect on the availability of supply. There are other reasons, but the activities have had an effect on the supply of heroin on the streets of Australia, and the fact that there has been that decline - and I think that trend has also been mirrored in New South Wales -  means that those who run around saying that the only answer to this problem is to throw up your arms, surrender and legalise it all are wrong.  That will always remain the attitude of this government. I say to those opposite, who are inclined -  through the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition this morning - to give some comfort to the idea of a heroin trial, that I think they are wrong. On this issue there is a very sharp division between the government and the opposition. I was disappointed with the remarks by the Leader of the Opposition today. I might conclude this answer by saying that during its last four years in office the former Keating Labor government provided only $13 million in net new money in the fight against drugs. In the time that this government has been in office, over the last four years, we have provided $314 million to finance the campaign against drugs. Let me make it clear: while ever this government is in office and while ever I am Prime Minister of this country, there will be no heroin trial. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am aware of the audit report tabled yesterday in the parliament, and I would like to say a couple of things about it. First, I would like to say - and this is said in fairness to members on both sides of the House - that of the 90,000 transactions to which the ANAO had access, only 54 were deemed to have been in error; and, of these, 42 had been already identified by the Department of Finance and Administration. There is no evidence in this report of systemic abuse and I have not been able to find any solid evidence in this report of deliberate acts of dishonesty on the part of members. I think it is important, unpopular though it may be, to say that it is the case that, in order to carry out their duties properly, members on both sides of the House are entitled to a number of things which may seem to the general public on occasion to be excessive. In a big country such as Australia, you do have to travel a lot. You cannot do your job as a minister, you cannot do your job as a shadow minister and you cannot do your job as a parliamentary committee member without travelling a great deal. We are constantly being asked by the public and by the media to provide more information. We are constantly being asked, and properly so, to more effectively service our electorates. That is the backdrop against which I would make a further couple of comments. Having said that, let me say that the government will very carefully examine what is in the report. For my part, I have to say that I think there is a case for capping a number of the allowances and entitlements, both in relation to current members and also former members. I have already commissioned some work to be done in relation to that and I will be having something further to say about it. In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, I would go further than what he said; I would actually do something now. I would actually place some caps on some of these allowances and entitlements. Of course, I note again with interest that this is something else that was going to be done in the 14th year. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I think there is a case and I am already having work done on that. My recollection and understanding may be in error in relation to this, but it is my understanding that, whereas half-yearly reports are tabled in the parliament in relation to serving members, that may not be the case in relation to former members. I have to say that the distinction escapes me and the justification for that distinction escapes me, and unless there is a solid reason for that distinction to be maintained, I think it should be abandoned.</DOC>

 - I wonder if I might take the opportunity also of welcoming the Argentine foreign minister - he is a good friend of mine and I am delighted to see him in our parliament - as well as Michel Rocard.I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I acknowledge, by the way, the honourable member's interest in Bougainville. He visited in 1999 as part of a parliamentary committee to examine the peace process. The government warmly welcomes the announcement made yesterday by Prime Minister Mekere Morauta that the Papua New Guinea government has endorsed, albeit with some minor modifications, a comprehensive settlement agreement for Bougainville. This is a very significant step in bringing to a close a very bloody and very long-running dispute in Bougainville.The international media may not be very interested in Bougainville, and I think it is fair to say that they are not, but it is worth the House remembering that between three and four times as many people have died in the Bougainville dispute, either directly or indirectly as a result of the civil war, as have died in the Northern Ireland dispute since 1969, and this is on our doorstep. We have seen it as a fundamental duty of this government to do everything we can to try to bring peace to Bougainville. Importantly, working with our friends across the Tasman in New Zealand, we have made a very big contribution to it. We have provided, over the last four or so years, close to $100 million worth of aid. We have provided the bulk of the peace monitoring group since April 1999. About 2,000 Defence Force personnel have served in the peace monitoring group, as well as 260 civilian monitors. We have made an enormous diplomatic effort. In particular, I acknowledge the constituents of the member for Herbert, the people of Townsville, who hosted the Townsville Bougainville peace talks earlier this year. They did an outstanding job and it is a great tribute to Townsville that it has turned out to be such a centre of peace talks for Australia and for the South Pacific.This peace agreement has been somewhat modified, albeit in a minor way, by the Papua New Guinea cabinet, and those modifications will have to be accepted by the people of Bougainville. I hope that they will be accepted, because they are very small modifications. I think this is going to be a very historic development for the South Pacific. We place a great deal of emphasis on doing what we can to achieve peace in this part of the world. I think one of the proudest achievements, albeit one of the least recognised achievements, of this government has been the role we played in bringing to an end that bloody civil war and bringing peace to the people of Bougainville and the people of Papua New Guinea. </DOC>

 - I have got to say that I am once again struggling with the morality of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. I am struggling with the political hypocrisy of a man who served as a senior member of a government for 13 years and did nothing at all to secure the entitlements of people who lose their entitlements when a company goes broke. Could I also remind the Leader of the Opposition that, although he might be trying to bring about another result by the use of the language that he employs in this issue, the Tristar company is trading quite profitably. Through all of this dispute, no evidence has been produced to suggest that a worker made redundant by that company would not get his or her full entitlements - no evidence. The whole construct on which the Leader of the Opposition's question is based is completely false.The other point I would make is that the first government in Australia to bring in a scheme has been the government I lead. We watched for 13 years as the Labor Party did absolutely nothing. We have brought in a scheme.  - The Treasurer reminds me that they opposed the scheme, and they have encouraged the Labor states not to join it. This man leads a party that has encouraged the Labor states of Australia not to join our scheme. You have made a deal with the Labor leaders for them to continue to oppose our scheme until the election, on the understanding, of course, that that will strengthen the alternative being put forward by the Labor Party. I want to make it clear that we have a scheme. That scheme is a safety net. It has been in operation now for 18 months and, if the states were prepared to join that scheme, you would have a situation where a very good safety net was available in that small number of cases - and it is half of one per cent or less - of companies that go broke and are not able to meet their entitlements. You would have a scheme that covered the great bulk of their entitlements. The Leader of the Opposition is asking the Australian public to accept that a government which did nothing for 13 years, but which now promises everything, is more credible than a government that has at least made a start while it has had the reins of power to introduce a scheme that is worthwhile and effective for the workers. I would say to the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania: don't go on dudding the workers in your states, because that is basically what you are doing. The Labor premiers of those states are dudding the trade unionists of those states by refusing to join the Commonwealth scheme. At least the Premier of South Australia has some concern for the workers in the motor vehicle industry in South Australia, and for the workers of that state, because that is the reason why he has joined the government scheme. I thank him for that, and I remind the House again of the monumental hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. Each year at budget time the government publishes historical data on the state of the budget going back over previous decades. I will table again the historical data. To take two years in question which will be of interest to some here, in 1994-95, the outcome - not the budget, the outcome - was a deficit of $13 billion, and in 1995-96, the outcome was a deficit of $10 billion. I will table that document.  Conversely, I will also table the historical data on the Commonwealth's debt provision, because obviously if you turn a deficit of $10 billion, you have to borrow the difference. The deficit of $10 billion meant that the government spent $10 billion that it did not have. I will table the historical data on the Commonwealth's debt position showing that in 1995-96 we borrowed over $10 billion to finance our deficit. The year before, we borrowed about $13 billion to fund our government deficit. That is historical data and it is on the record. It goes back for decades. When we borrowed that $10 billion to fund the deficit, we had to go onto the financial markets and borrow it. The Commonwealth was driving up interest rates. It was not imaginary; you had to actually borrow it so that your cheques were honoured. I am asked whether I am aware of any revisions to previous budget outcomes. Strange as it may seem, I read a story in the Financial Review today about the honourable member for Melbourne in which he revises previous budget outcomes. It is the most extraordinary piece. My eye was taken by a little insert where he describes a lot of the middle of politics as dead-cert boring. - Oh, that was Latham, was it? The member for Melbourne finds the middle of politics highly interesting; I have done him an injustice. This is what he said in the face of the historical records:The so-called `black hole' was essentially a creation of fiddling with the parameters that was done by the incoming government, rather then anything more concrete.Apparently it was not concrete when we had to go out and borrow $10 billion. That was imaginary, was it? Government bonds worth $10 billion were issued to finance the deficit outcome and he says that it was `not concrete'. These were bonds that had to be issued and on which the Commonwealth had to pay interest. The article in the Financial Review then asks:It was an imaginary black hole then?To which the member for Melbourne replied:The bulk of it was simply created by fiddling with the parameters.He has single-handedly revised a budget outcome -  not a budget forecast but a budget outcome as recorded in the Commonwealth historical accounts, as backed up by the Commonwealth debt position and as represented by actual bonds that were issued to fund that deficit. I have often sat here and wondered whether the Labor Party are dishonest or incompetent. When they go on with the idea that there was not an actual deficit, is it dishonesty or is incompetence? Is it that they knew but wanted to cover it up, or is it that they never knew and still have not apologised? They still cannot come to grips with the mismanagement of the financial accounts. These are not budget forecasts; these are outcomes. The outcome of the last year of the then Minister for Finance, now the Leader of the Opposition, was a $10 billion outcome. After we had paid the bills and got the revenues in, we were $10 billion short and we issued $10 billion worth of government bonds, which we paid interest on and which we went into the financial markets for. That was the outcome as at 30 June and throughout that campaign, as late as February, the then Minister for Finance was trying to tell the Australian people that we were in surplus. Was it dishonesty or was it incompetence?I want to table one last piece of evidence that might also come as a revelation to the would-be finance minister of the Labor Party. You wonder why he is the would-be finance minister of the Labor Party. He probably makes these statements to try to make the last Labor Party finance minister look good. In a press release on 10 May 1998 the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer, Gareth Evans, had this to say:It's not news for me to acknowledge that the 1995-96 Budget outcome was recorded in the 1996-97 Budget papers as an underlying deficit of $10.3 billion.  - No, that is not how we wrote it; that is where it came in. That is the $10 billion you had to borrow. You do not write $10 billion worth of unnecessary bond borrowings to try to make sure that your cheques do not bounce. They were issued. This is what Gareth Evans had to say when he finally admitted that the Labor Party's budget outcome deficit was $10 billion in the red:That was given massive publicity at the time and, unlike Peter Reith, I am not in the business of claiming that black is white.Mr Reith has never done that, but the shadow minister for finance gets back into the business of claiming that black is white. He single-handedly revises the budget outcome. He tries to wish away $10 billion worth of bonds. He refuses to acknowledge the reason that we now have a Charter of Budget Honesty: the most deceitful conduct during an election campaign in Australian history from Australia's worst finance minister ever was from the Leader of the Opposition who, unlike Gareth Evans, has never had the decency to come out and admit what the situation was. And he now tries to inveigle the member for Melbourne to support him in that dishonesty.</DOC>

 - Let me simply say that the circumstances that gave rise to the National Textiles matter arose before our scheme was put in place. It is as simple as that so, obviously, I did not do what the member for Brisbane suggests I did. Let me also make this fundamental point: this government has nothing to apologise for in the National Textiles matter. I have here a letter saying, `We request that your government provide immediate financial assistance to National Textiles workers.' That letter is from the state Labor minister, Richard Face; it is from the member for Paterson in this House; it is from the member for Hunter in this House. What the government did in the case of National Textiles was perfectly right. - How could it be so right then and so wrong now?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. No-one in this House is more concerned about protecting the interests of small business than the member for Moreton, and I congratulate him. For almost a decade, federal unfair dismissal laws have been a serious obstacle to employment growth in this country. To put it at its most simple and most plain, if it is expensive to let people go, it is hard to take people on. That is the problem with the former government's unfair dismissal laws. Thanks to those laws, Australian business has routinely been paying thousands of dollars to departing employees over and above their entitlements, even in cases of illegality or gross negligence. This government changed the unfair dismissal laws in 1996, but unfortunately that has not stopped a small mercenary group of ambulance chasing lawyers and unscrupulous union officials from bringing nuisance unfair dismissal applications in ways that amount to the legal harassment of small business. I am delighted to tell the member for Moreton and the House that significant relief is now at hand. This morning the Senate passed the government's termination bill. That bill imposes penalties on lawyers and other advisers who encourage speculative and unmeritorious unfair dismissal claims. It requires the disclosure of `no win, no fee' arrangements by lawyers and other advisers; it allows the Industrial Relations Commission to exclude unmeritorious claims after just one conciliation hearing; and, most importantly, it establishes a standard, three-month probationary period for all new employees, during which the unfair dismissal laws will not apply. This is a very serious and significant breakthrough for small business. I thank the Minister for Small Business for his untiring efforts in bringing the concerns of small business before the government and before the cabinet. I thank the Senate, particularly Senator Murray and the Australian Democrats, for adopting such a constructive attitude to the government's bill. This is a sign of this government's unflagging determination to boost employment in this country, and it is a sign of our determination to let small business create more jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Melbourne for his question. I would first like to congratulate the member for Melbourne on a personal event that occurred during the break. I extend my best wishes to him on his recent marriage. I will come to the question, which is of course what the honourable member for Melbourne wants me to do, and I am happy to do so. I think we should see this report from the Auditor-General in its true perspective. That report indicated that the government's program was very successful. In terms of value, the sale of government properties exceeded forecasts by some $131 million. In other words, the return was 15 per cent above the forecast. A number of other successes were acknowledged by the Auditor-General, including the fact that most of the properties were sold at or above their market value. The Auditor-General did raise a number of points, and I do not say this lightly, because it would be on the record that I was the minister responsible for bringing about some significant reform to the audit acts after some eight years. I think my predecessor in Finance had a bit of a go at that, and I picked up the ball and we ultimately delivered some additional support for the Auditor-General. I have a high regard for the institution of the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament and for the role that the Auditor-General plays in terms of the management of the government's expenditure and revenue.Having said that, there were some highly inaccurate comments made in that report and, dare I say, in some very lazy reporting on that report. Let me take you to some. It is a big statement, and I am happy to back it up. There was a reference to the AGSO building in Canberra. That building was sold by the government. An exercise was done by the Auditor-General and, over the life of the lease - some 20 years - the Auditor-General suggested that if the rental went up in an incremental way, as it tends to do in leases, at a rate based upon CPI of 5½ per cent or more per annum, then, on a net present value factor after a 20 year lease, you would lose $265 million. If you go back over the past 10 years, there has been only one occasion when CPI exceeded 10 per cent. In fact, in 1997-98, I think it was, there was negative CPI. If you take what has been in the forecasts of the government for some years as well as is in the current budget, and is generally accepted by most analysts - a three per cent increment - and if you take away the second factor that the Auditor-General put into the exercise, which is that the agency would have to borrow money to pay for this increased rental, you come out on a net present value after 20 years with a $57 million positive. The second one is the R.G. Casey Building. The Auditor-General did an exercise which said that that lease contained a two per cent incremental lease payment per year - not nine per cent compounded, like Centenary House - and it also contained a provision for a market review every three years. At the current time, there is a market review. There is an ask of 38 per cent by the owner of that building. I have the utmost confidence in the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade to say that none of the people in DFAT will pay a 38 per cent increase on their rent. There has not been that sort of an increase in Canberra, with the exception of one building. We know that building: it is the building that houses the Auditor-General. It is called Centenary House, and it has built into it a nine per cent compounding interest rate. In fact, its rental is currently way above the most prestigious high-rise rental of Sydney. It means $36 million of losses to the taxpayers of Australia.I come back to what the Auditor-General found. There was $131 million more achieved for the Commonwealth and the taxpayers, which retired Labor's debt - $131 million more than was ever forecast. The examples were inaccurate. I did not say it lightly, and I proved my point in terms of just where it was inaccurate. This government takes its responsibilities very seriously. We had a debt - you heard the Treasurer today, in no uncertain terms, point out just what that debt was - and we had to do something about it. One of the decisions we took was to put the scarce capital into education, into health and into welfare and not into bricks and mortar. If we really want to get serious about the Auditor-General and the Auditor-General's reports, let me finish on the 1995-96 Auditor-General's report on the government management of real estate in the years leading up to 1995-96. There is one out there at Tuggeranong Park - a decision taken by the Labor government in 1989. With Tuggeranong Park, some very interesting figures have been pointed out by the Auditor-General. Firstly, there is a financing arrangement that makes noodle nation look like a very sensible proposal. When the audit was done in 1995-96, the Auditor-General found in respect of Tuggeranong Park that there was a liability in the Commonwealth's accounts of more than $75 million on this creative accounting process of financing. Further, the Auditor-General went on to say that, during the life of the lease on that alone, the shortfall would be more like $195 million - significantly more. We have managed that better. We have got it down to a $115 million shortfall. That is Tuggeranong Park.We know about Centenary House; I have already referred to that. On the management of the government's property, I will conclude by simply saying this: that same report said that, just to bring the existing government property up to proper standards, there was a need to spend $900 million. Most of the buildings that were being looked after by the Labor government did not pass occupational health and safety standards. I can say very clearly there has been a proper management of the sales of the government's properties. That has reduced Labor's debt. A number of the examples that the Auditor-General has provided do not stand up.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question and for the concern he has to protect workers' entitlements. Let me say, particularly to members opposite who support the Manusafe scheme, that the protection of workers' entitlements is a very important issue, but it does not justify shutting down a major Australian industry. You do not protect workers' entitlements by taking away the right to work of tens of thousands of your fellow Australians. I am aware that members opposite now think that the only way to protect entitlements is through schemes like Manusafe. But this certainly was not always their view. I have a letter from the then minister for industrial relations, Ralph Willis, who said:The establishment of a wage-earner protection fund is opposed. It would impose an unfair burden on the greater proportion of employers who conduct their businesses efficiently.He went on to say:Such a fund may also act as a disincentive to some employers to conduct their businesses on a responsible and proper financial basis.That is not all. I have here a document that was released in 1992, when none other than the Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. This document was issued by the then Attorney-General, Michael Duffy, and dealt with this whole issue of the protection of workers' entitlements and the establishment of a wage protection fund. At the time when the gentleman opposite was minister for employment, Mr Duffy said:... the fund would be a further imposition on existing successful businesses, and it would be better to retain and develop, where possible, existing employee priority provisions.Mr Speaker, I table those two documents. The Leader of the Opposition needs to explain why a Manusafe type fund was so wrong when he was in government but so right now that he is in opposition. Unlike the former government, this government has not neglected the issue of employee entitlements. The difference between our scheme and all the other proposals floating around is that our scheme does not cost jobs because our scheme is not a levy on payroll.I am aware of a statement by the Labor premiers yesterday, saying that they would not join the government's scheme. That statement means that a South Australian worker who has lost entitlements gets twice as much as a worker in any other Labor state. It means that workers in Labor states are missing out on thousands of dollars - to suit the political concerns of the Labor Party. It means that the Labor premiers are refusing to pay a single dollar to workers who have lost entitlements and who are therefore facing perhaps the most calamitous time in their lives. The Labor premiers believe that the federal government scheme is less than perfect, but I say to them, `Surely, something is better than nothing.'The Leader of the Opposition likes to quote people to the Prime Minister. Let me quote Mr Thomas Beard, who worked for a Queensland company that went broke and was unable to pay entitlements. Mr Beard said:I have written to the Queensland state government asking them why they are not participating in the scheme. If they were, I would have got over $17,000 of what I was owed instead of only half that amount, $8½ thousand.It is a fair question. Premier Beattie ought to answer it and all the other Labor premiers ought to answer it. If members opposite were really concerned about workers, they would tell their state Labor colleagues to join the government's scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Now that our health insurance initiatives have been successful in getting more Australians into private health cover and making it better value, we are seeing the benefits coming through. A vital part of this system has been our no gaps or known gaps schemes. They have met with some opposition from parts of the medical profession but, by and large, doctors have been very supportive. For example, Medibank Private, the largest fund in the country, tell me that they now have nearly 4,700 specialists on their web site who have signed up for gap cover schemes, and this does not include the 1,600 doctors who have charged under Medibank's private gap scheme but are not listed on the web site or the 6½ thousand specialists who regularly charge only up to the Medicare benefits schedule. Some weeks ago, Medibank Private launched a web site listing specialists. They inform me that in the month of July, the first full month, they got 35,000 hits on that web site, which clearly shows that there is a demand for this information. Consumers do want to be informed, and this would seem to be quite reasonable. But, of course, what is reasonable for one person may not be reasonable for another. It is quite appropriate that the member for Aston should be asking me this question because it was during the recent by-election that views were sought from all candidates on the future of the 30 per cent rebate scheme. There are 65,000 people in Aston with private health cover. Only one major candidate failed to answer the question: would you oppose anything that would diminish the value of the health insurance rebate to contributors and their families? That was the Labor candidate. The Labor candidate resolutely refused to answer that question. Instead, he just had a pro forma letter that had come out from Canberra. So we have the Labor Party refusing to answer the question: will you guarantee that the 30 per cent rebate will not be diminished in value to families and contributors? - The Labor Party has form on this. - In 1993 in this House, the Leader of the Opposition made the following statement in an l-a-w tax debate as a matter of urgency:The fact that the opposition does not rub the electorate's nose in what we say are our election promises does not mean that we are breaking our election promises. ...				...					...If in the course of an election campaign opposition members are incapable of getting that point of view through to the Australian people, then they should not come in here and tell us that we lied to them.To translate that very verbose quote, it basically means, `If the electorate is too stupid not to realise what our weasel words mean, then that is their problem.' Let me tell you what the weasel words from the opposition on the 30 per cent rebate mean: those words mean that they have not ruled out taking the rebate off ancillaries, they have not ruled out taking the rebate off products with high front-end deductibles, they have not ruled out taking the rebate off exclusion products, they have not ruled out making the rebate being only paid on base premiums and they have not ruled out only allowing the rebate to apply to existing members and not new members. Those things specifically have not been ruled out by the Labor Party. They have refused to rule them out, and we have every right to assert that this is the Labor Party's agenda: to wreck private health insurance, as they did under the Whitlam government, as they did under the Hawke government and as they will do again if they are ever given the opportunity.</DOC>

 - As to the particular circumstances of that case, I am not aware of them. I ask the honourable member for Jagajaga to send to my office the particular circumstances and I will make my own inquiries and satisfy myself as to what occurred. I do not think that even in the extremes of political combat in this place at this point of the electoral cycle I am expected to have a detailed knowledge of every exchange between Australian citizens and health centres all around the country, but I will find out. I share any compassion that the member for Jagajaga feels for any Australian citizen who does not get decent, affordable, prompt medical treatment.Having said that, I will address some remarks to the generalities of the issue that have been raised. The whole basis of the political attack in the honourable member's question is that in some way the Australian health system is becoming Americanised. With the greatest of respect to the member for Jagajaga, that is not only an absurd exaggeration but it is not justified in any way by the facts. To start with, we have a system in this country called Medicare. That system was introduced by a Labor government and that system has been embraced by this government, and it has in fact been strengthened by this government. It was strengthened through the introduction of something that we still suspect that if you win office you will take away, and that is the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.It is very instructive that the most reluctant adherent to the nominal commitment the Labor Party has made to the maintenance of the 30 per cent health rebate if Labor wins office is in fact my interrogator, the member for Jagajaga. If ever there was a reluctant supporter - and she knows it and she grins in acknowledgment - of the 30 per cent private health rebate, it is the good old member for Jagajaga. She is not really very enthusiastic about it. It was put out in the dead of night as Cathy Freeman won the 400 metres. That commitment was put out in Ballarat in the dead of night, at about half past eight one evening while the eyes of the nation were on Cathy Freeman winning the 400 metres. They snuck this out and said, `Yes, we are in favour of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.' I have to tell you that I am not convinced. I do not think any of my colleagues are convinced either, and I do not think the Australian public is convinced.I think that for all the criticism in this debate -  - I have got a lot more to say about the health policies of this government; I am warming to the task, let me say to the member for Jagajaga. We have not only brought in a private health insurance rebate; we have not only provided lifetime health cover, which has dramatically increased to a level of 45 per cent private health insurance; but on top of that, under the new Australian health care agreements we have increased health funding to the Australian states by 28 per cent in real terms over a period of five years. That represents the measure of the additional dollars. The member for Jagajaga asked me about dollars. We have given billions more to the Australian states. But on top of that we have done something else: we have introduced the greatest long-term guarantee any government can give to this country for the provision of additional public services to the needy, and that is a broad based indirect tax - a goods and services tax. If you are to guarantee services for the needy in the years ahead with an ageing population, you must secure the revenue base. The only side of politics that believes in securing a revenue base in this country is the coalition. Those who would seek to roll back the GST would seek to roll back the capacity of this nation in the years ahead to look after the needy.It is passing very strange to me that the party that always represents itself as being the party that cares for the needy and is interested in the fate of the underprivileged is the party that, if it won government, would roll back this nation's capacity to look after the needy via a secure revenue base in the years ahead. I say to the member for Jagajaga, as I say to all of those opposite, that increasingly, as you get locked further and further into a policy of roll-back, we will remind the Australian people of the contribution that the GST is making, via a secure revenue base, to the provision of services for the needy in the Australian community. If you want decent health services, support a broad based indirect tax; if you want decent public services, support a broad based indirect tax; if you do not want those good services, you support a policy of roll-back, which is the policy of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. The government recognises the importance of ensuring that Australian schools have good quality classrooms, school blocks and libraries. This year the Howard government is going to be providing some $222 million to support these kinds of capital improvements in government schools. This compares with $87 million that will be provided to the non-government school sector.To date this year, the Commonwealth government has spent some $72 million on new and replacement government schools. I make the point that federal funding has been vital to the establishment of these new government schools. This year we have provided, for example, $2.25 million for the construction of the Cranbourne Special School in Victoria, $5½ million for the construction of the Mount Annan High School in New South Wales, $5.4 million for the Mawson Lakes School in South Australia, $8 million for Woodcrest College in Queensland and $10 million for the construction of the Great Lakes College in New South Wales. The member for Riverina will recall that we have provided over half a million dollars for the War Memorial High School in Hay this year for new works at the school.Many of the new schools and replacement schools have been built in New South Wales. In fact, 18 of the 33 new or replacement schools funded by the federal government have been in New South Wales. No state government has had a worse record in recent years in investing in its public education system than the Carr government in New South Wales. It is the state government that has the principal responsibility, and those calling on the federal government for an even greater effort would do well to focus their attention on the Labor Party states whose funding is growing at a significantly lower rate than Commonwealth funding. Indeed, this very point is made in the editorial in today's Courier-Mail on the Queensland Teachers Union campaign. The editorial is headed `Teachers union fails funding test'. It says: The Queensland Teachers Union should be made to write out 100 times: State education is the responsibility of the State Government. So, if education funding in Queensland has fallen short of what the QTU thinks appropriate, the protests should be aimed at the bottom end of George Street, not Canberra.It goes on to say that the fact that the state government has failed to expand its funding for government schools - ... in any dramatic fashion says volumes about the Beattie government.It concludes:The QTU - Queensland Teachers Union - would be better advised to throw its weight behind this kind of reform, rather than running political interference for the Australian Labor Party.And that is precisely what that union campaign is all about. In March this year I had the great pleasure of opening the Camden Haven High School in the electorate of the Minister for Trade. The Commonwealth contribution to the Camden Haven High School was $14 million, and $14 million is more than the total sum that the Commonwealth is seeking to appropriate for establishment grants for new non-government schools over the next four years. That investment in that one school is greater than the establishment grants we are seeking to appropriate for the next four years for schools in the non-government sector. Nothing could show more clearly the utter hypocrisy of the Labor Party and the political campaigns that are currently being run by the education unions in the states. - I would be very happy to table the editorial.</DOC>

 - Once again, if the member for Ryan is good enough to send me all the details of that, I will have some further inquiries made. More specifically, in relation to this question, I have something to say about the responsibility for that program. That program was introduced for a set period of time and that time expired. That program made a very significant contribution to a reduction in the waiting list, but it is nonetheless the case that dental care programs of that type have historically been the responsibility of the states.I would say to the member for Ryan that if she cares for this particular person - and I am not suggesting she does not - she would send the details of his case to the Queensland Premier. I would also remind the member for Ryan, as I take the opportunity of reminding those opposite, that of all the Australian states none is a bigger winner out of the GST than Queensland. In fact, Queensland is better off earlier under the GST. It was not only physical bulk but it was also enthusiasm that enabled the Queensland Premier to beat the New South Wales Premier to grab the fountain pen out of my hand in order to sign the intergovernmental agreement in relation to the GST. Queensland could well be better off under the GST as soon as next year or the year after, and there is no state that is better endowed.The whole idea of the new revenue sharing arrangements is to ensure that, where there is a responsibility, the state has more resources to fund it. It is a perfect illustration of how, in the years ahead, the GST, which is built on a growing revenue base, is going to enable the states to have a greater capacity to fund the services for which they are constitutionally responsible. The whole idea of the separation of responsibilities in this country is that some things belong to the federal government and some to the states. What has been wrong with Commonwealth-state financial relations until now is that the states have had a constant alibi every time they are unwilling to accept their responsibilities. That alibi is that they have been starved of money by the federal government. That is the case no longer, because under the GST they will have a guaranteed access to a rising revenue source. Whether they are a Beattie Labor state or, indeed, they are a coalition governed state, they will have no excuse in the future for avoiding their constitutional responsibility to the people who elect them. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. He has been assiduous in winning a generous slice of the government's more than $1 billion funding for regional, rural and remote areas of Australian for extending and upgrading telecommunications. As a result, his constituents in Mallee have seen a very comprehensive rollout of mobile phones in the north-west of Victoria. Recently, amongst other Networking the Nation successful grants, there has been an announcement of a Networking the Nation project in the township of Rainbow in Hindmarsh shire. As a result, his constituents in Mallee, as with those in so many other coalition rural and regional seats, have been rewarded for the work of their local members. Now, members will be looking to win a slice of the latest government response to the Besley inquiry. There are many features to it: $88 million for improved mobile -  - Pork-barrelling? We hear Cheryl, the seat of -  - Thank you - the member for Dickson. - Every time there is a government initiative backed up by dollars for country areas, whether it be for roads or telecommunications, it is pork-barrelling - we hear it again and again. So you oppose Networking the Nation? That is what it amounts to. -  - Oh, you agree? You oppose Networking the Nation. I am glad we have got that on the record. - Let me tell you some of the other things -  - Yes? - Mr Speaker, I could defend myself, but I really want to move on to the substance of the answer.  - Mr Speaker -  - Mr Speaker, there was a barrage of interjections from that side of the House and I did not hear you calling for my attention until the final point. They were simply conducting a deliberate campaign and, without the benefit of your protection, I did not hear your intervention. That is why I said I could have defended myself, convincingly.  - Mr Speaker, I freely apologise and I thank you for the courtesy and tolerance you have extended to me. Moving straight on to this question of alternate policies, it is very important that we record what alternate policies are being pursued by the Leader of the Opposition, because as we know he has made Telstra the cornerstone of his noodle nation policy. Without Telstra's involvement, noodle nation simply collapses. This is what he spruiks as he has been going around with his Telstra campaign.The transcript of an interview on 20 July in Tweed Heads on radio 97AM was not posted on his web site and was not boxed. What we have found is that he speaks about the dialogue he would engage in with Telstra to achieve Knowledge Nation objectives: roll-out, broadband, untimed local calls and the like. Bear in mind that `dialogue' is code for `direction of Telstra' - there is no mistaking that. What we find on page 8 of the transcript is a concession by the Leader of the Opposition that his proposals for noodle nation would cost you billions. We have it in black and white that the Leader of the Opposition says that noodle nation is going to cost billions and noodle nation is based on Telstra. The Leader of the Opposition has plans to direct Telstra. Where is the money coming from? Is it to come from Telstra borrowings? Is it to come from Telstra shareholders? Is it to come from the government budget pushing it into deficit? Is it to come from income tax rates increases? Where is the money coming from by your direction of Telstra? The simple fact is that noodle nation has no credibility because there are no funding allocations or sources identified by the Leader of the Opposition. - Mr Max Walsh, in response to the questions raised by the Leader of the Opposition's noodle nation being based on Telstra and all of the costs that go with it plus the effect on the sharemarket of direction of Telstra, had this to say in the 31 July edition of the Bulletin:... should a Labor government use its majority holding in Telstra to impose non-commercial policies then we could well find ourselves pitched into a national financial crisis.So the question for the Leader of the Opposition is: where is the money coming from? Is he going to plunge the country into another financial crisis, as he did when he was minister for finance, and bequeath a $10 billion debt, as he did in his last year in control of the Commonwealth's finances? Frankly, Australians deserve better from a man who claims to be ready for office.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for that question. I do not remember the precise terms, but I get the drift of the question. Can I just remind the member for Dobell that there are more resources going into universities now than ever before. There are more resources going into universities and there are more people attending universities than ever before, so any suggestion that there is some kind of crisis in universities is a complete falsehood. The question asked by the member for Dobell is an important question, because it talks of the future of that percentage of the Australian community who when they leave school go on to university. It is important that we take adequate care of them and that we provide adequately for them.It is also very important that we also have policies that help the 70 per cent who do not go to university. In that area I am immensely proud that this government has been stunningly successful in the resuscitation of the apprenticeship system that you left in ruins. When we came to office we found the situation with the apprenticeship system was that it had stagnated somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 for a period of five or six years. In the space of 5½ years we have more than doubled the number of Australians in apprenticeships - from something like 120,000 or 150,000 to something like 305,000. - Mr Speaker, I simply make the point that the government I lead is interested in the educational future of those who go to university. We are also interested in the training future of those who do not go to university. That comprises about 70 per cent of young Australians who leave school, and their opportunities for apprenticeships now have improved dramatically under this government. I know that it is painful for a Labor shadow minister to be told that this government has been twice as successful in providing apprenticeships for the young men and women of this country as was the former Labor administration. We have seen a spectacular increase in the number of young women in apprenticeships, from something like 16 per cent back in 1995 to close to a third now. We have seen a dramatic rise in the number of indigenous people in traineeships. We have seen a broadening of the apprenticeship classification. The reason this has happened is that we have taken the control of the apprenticeship system out of the grip of the award system and we have based apprenticeships on the needs of young people and the needs of their employers.Of all of the achievements of my government that have been important to the working men and women of this country, none is more important than the opportunity we have given to their sons and daughters both to go to university and to go into apprenticeships. To double the number of apprenticeships in 5½ years is a stunning testimony to the commitment of this government to the generality of the people of Australia and something of which I am exceptionally proud.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question and her interest in the Job Network and the Work for the Dole programs and all of the government's successful employment services programs. The Australians Working Together - Helping People Move Forward package brings together an expansion of the Work for the Dole program, where we are seeing another 16,500 Work for the Dole participants, an additional 30,000 Job Search Training places and over $111 million put into training credits.All of these things have been applauded by people as we have moved around Australia. In fact, the applause has come from some pretty unexpected quarters. There have been comments such as this one: `This is the country's major employment service system. Much of it is going very, very well.' Another comment was: `I have had the pleasure of sitting in on job search training and intensive assistance sessions. It has been quite inspiring and I congratulate you on it.' On indigenous employment, there was this comment: `I actually think the government has done quite a good job in this area.' So where is this praise coming from? It is coming from no-one other than the member for Dickson, the shadow minister. The shadow minister made all of those comments - fulsome praise of the government's employment services when -  - Would the member for Dickson like to add another piece of praise there? During the NESA conference on 25 July, she not only made all of those comments but she also went on to say:If we win government - `we' being the Labor Party - we won't expose you to reform fatigue, I promise you. In any case all of the changes that I want to see made have already been implemented or will have been implemented by this government.That is, the Howard government. So I thank the shadow minister for those comments.Mr Speaker, you can understand my surprise when on Sunday during Meet the Press the shadow minister started to retract from those points of view and started -  -  - She did not, okay. - My apologies, Mr Speaker. She was asked this question by one of the panel:Have you got a rolled-gold guarantee that you'll get the same money should Labor win government at the end of the year? Her answer was:I'm pretty confident about it, yes, I am. She was then asked a question by the Courier-Mail journalist, Dennis Atkins. He asked her, `Well, you intend to pull forward some expenditure, don't you. So therefore which of these projects are you going to cut?' `Oh, no, no, I'm not going to cut any projects.'So the Labor Party is not cutting any projects. She has given us fulsome praise of Australians Working Together and the Job Network, but then she says that she wants to introduce some new programs on behalf of the Labor Party, some of which she has costed - `bring forward expenditure,' she says. This is what she had to say at the NESA conference: `One, I'd like an independent monitoring authority. It will only cost a couple of million dollars. We've already allowed for it in our budget.' - I am just wondering whether you have shared that with the shadow Treasurer, the shadow finance minister or the Leader of the Opposition, because that budget is not on Kim's web page about his plan for Australia. More importantly, she went on to say this about mature age workers: `We intend to give them immediate access to intensive assistance and make sure they have the funds.' So I asked my department to cost what it would be for every mature age worker to have immediate access to IA today. It is $104 million in the first year. Is that costed in your budget as well? Is that on top of the $1.7 billion?  That is not all; there is more. Mr Speaker, when you buy an independent monitoring review and you buy mature age workers access to IA, you also can throw in access to all retrenched workers at a cost of $230 million per year - that is, nearly $1 billion additional funding into one portfolio over four years. Where is the money coming from? I will tell you where the money is coming from. She told us where the money is coming from when she spoke to Meet the Press. She was asked by Vivian Schenker from ABC Radio National:... you've talked about new initiatives like more after-school-care places for kids. But how do you pay for those sorts of new initiatives, particularly if you're going to roll back the GST?The shadow minister had an answer. It was:Well, the first thing is, a whole lot of them don't cost anything. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that child care does cost money, that providing IA does cost money and that providing money to retrenched workers is expensive. The question is: are we going to see more of the Beazley bankcard, or are we going to see you with your slimy hand in the pockets of every working family in this country, pulling taxes out of the working man of Australia?</DOC>

 - I notice that the Leader of the Opposition never condemned a strike which put 12,000 people out of work. The Leader of the Opposition never said boo to the union that caused 12,000 workers to be out of work. The Leader of the Opposition never condemned the Manusafe scheme, which amounts to a 19 per cent levy on payroll -  - At every step of this process, the Leader of the Opposition has stood shoulder to shoulder with the ultra-militants who have threatened the future of the motor industry. It is the Leader of the Opposition who should be apologising to all of the 12,000 workers stood down as a result of the industrial action that he completely supported.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. I can report to the House that overnight the OECD released its economic survey on Australia, forecasting growth picking up in 2002 to 3.8 per cent and noting that Australia would be one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world next year.We know that the United States economy has slowed very considerably, the Japanese economy is now in recession, Singapore is in recession, Taiwan and most of South-East Asia have had negative quarters and Europe is slowing. This is making world growth very uncertain and weaker than it has been probably for over a decade. But the good news is that, notwithstanding the weakness of the world economy, the Australian economy has held up very strongly and the Australian economy is now considered to be one of the strongest growing economies of the developed world.The OECD report also made a number of findings as to what contributed to the strengthening of the Australian economy. It found, for example, that the recent tax reform would contribute a further improvement in economic performance, a broader and more efficient tax base reinforcing the benefits of fiscal consolidation. A narrower and less efficient tax base, the kind of tax base that roll-back is designed to give us, would of course undermine fiscal consolidation. The Labor Party would take us right back to where they had us: $10 billion worth of debt, an $80 billion build-up of debt over the last five years and $23 billion worth of build-up of debt under the worst finance minister in Australian history. The OECD also said that major economic benefits should accrue from the comprehensive tax reform, the first major step of which came into effect on 1 July 2000. As the Australian economy strengthens over the course of 2002, we would expect growing job opportunities for Australians. Employment is a lagging indicator: as your economy strengthens, you would expect, after some months, jobs growth to strengthen. We expect jobs growth to strengthen in 2002.The OECD report is a report on the way in which good economic policy can bring results. I make this point: it would not have happened just by accident. It would not have happened that Australia's exports would boom without taking taxes off exports; it would not have happened that we would have had low interest rates if we had not put the budget back into surplus; it would not have happened that we would have low home mortgage variable interest rates if we had not repaid $60 billion of Labor's $80 billion worth of debt. This report shows some of the benefits from economic policy, but the message is that good economic management must continue. It is important that we keep good budget and good tax policy and, most importantly, that we do not roll backwards on all of the good work that has been done in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - If the Labor Party really believed the GST was the author of such havoc on the Australian economy, they would have pledged to repeal it. I have never really understood this point that, on the one hand, the Labor Party would have you believe that the GST has caused havoc in the fastest growing economy in the world, most probably caused an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom and most probably is responsible for Mount Etna erupting, but, if they ever get elected to office, what do they want to do? They want to keep it. Every time you ask them about the extent of roll-backwards and say, `GST raises $24 billion. Will you commit yourself to rolling backwards 50 per cent, or $12 billion?' they say, `No, it's not $12 billion.' If we say, `Will you commit to rolling backwards one-third of the way?' they say, `No, we wouldn't commit to that.' Roll-backwards - the policy which dare not speak its name - disappears by the minute. In the half-world of shadow and fantasy that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition exists in, roll-backwards is the policy that is required but can never actually be revealed.In relation to the labour force, let us put some facts on the table. The Australian unemployment rate is currently at 6.9 per cent, down from its peak of 10.9 per cent in December 1992, when the employment minister was the now Leader of the Opposition. Over the course of the five years since this government was elected in March 1996, there have been a net new 805,000 jobs created in the Australian economy. Youth unemployment has come down from the all-time high of 34.5 per cent in July 1992, when Mr Beazley was the employment minister, to a rate now of 24 per cent. As I said, we have made some substantial progress in relation to unemployment. We have undone a lot of Labor's damage. But have we finished? No, of course there is more work to be done in relation to unemployment.What do we have to do? We need a strong economy, and the Australian economy is holding up well compared with all of the economies of the developed world. More than that, we need labour market reform, because nothing would be better to bring down structural unemployment than labour market reform. I pay tribute to the work that has been done, but more labour market reform needs to be done. The third thing I say is this: if you were really interested in people maintaining their jobs in Australia, would you support the irresponsible union action that put 10,000 people out of work last week? The one thing we never heard from the Labor Party was a condemnation of a strike that threw 10,000 fellow Australians out of work. The Manufacturing Workers Union, affiliated to the ACTU, threw 10,000 Australians out of work last week, and the old ACTU president could not bring himself to condemn it. The Labor Party, if they get elected at the next election, will have three living former ACTU presidents on their front bench and a few dead ex-ACTU presidents sitting on their front bench, too. Who would ever believe that they could take a strong stand on labour market reform? Who would ever believe that they could support the kind of reform that is necessary to create real jobs for real people in this country?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question and acknowledge that that electorate, like so many others in rural and regional Australia, contributes massively to our export performance. Indeed, rural and regional exports remain - increasingly, it can be said - huge engines for economic growth in this country. There is no doubt that the partnership between the government and rural industries over the last 5½ years is starting to bear very real fruit. We are now, for the first time that I can remember in my adult life, all of which time I have been involved with rural Australia, seeing an improvement in the terms of trade for the nation's farmers virtually right across the board. That is to say, prices and incomes are rising faster than costs. That cannot happen without sound economic management.Indeed, the great export industries of rural and regional Australia - farming, mining, tourism and the manufacturing industries that spin off them, because the biggest employer of the lot in the manufacturing industry in Australia is the food and fibre processing sector - are all enjoying much improved prospects. Farm exports alone this year will be worth almost $30 billion, up 21 per cent on last year, constituting around 20 per cent of all of our exports. Higher prices - and this is an interesting point to those with an interest in trade, including the Minister for Trade - mean that more will be produced. That is what the nation's farmers will do. Higher beef prices, higher grain prices and higher wool prices will result in more beef, more grain and more wool. Not only will that produce more exports; it will produce a lot more manufacturing jobs, as that product is value added, and exports. Minerals and oil exports add another $40 billion to our nation's export earnings. Even international visitors to rural and regional Australia earn the nation around $2.5 billion a year.The people responsible for all of this have shown great resilience and great courage. They have battled all of the seasonal irregularities that we know are a feature of living in this country, but it is not so very long ago that they were also suffering under the yoke of the most monstrously damaging economic parameters of any of the farmers in the Western world, with interest rates through the roof - two and three times what their competitors in other countries were paying. Every year a farmer had to add 12 or 13 per cent farm inflation to his budgets for the year. It is a wonder, really, that the rural sector survived at all, but it did. It took the last 5½ years of partnership, when we have been prepared to put the economic house in order and to fight the issues that had to be tackled, for that to happen. We have been prepared to tackle tax reform: $3 billion of indirect taxes are no longer shackling our export industries. We have world-class telecommunications, so that you can export your organic beef out of Birdsville directly to Japan.The government have the vision to take on such projects as the Alice to Darwin railway and to ensure that AMC gets off the ground in Central Queensland as we become a world leader in light metals. The government worked with industries such as the pork industry through great difficulties to see it succeed in export markets, when every cheapjack political opportunist in the nation - particularly those opposite -  was running around saying that we ought to resort to protectionism. We did the hard yards. We held a course on reform. The pork industry today is in the best shape it has been in for decades, with a very strong future based on exports, particularly into Asia. These investments we have made are showing dividends in the very strong growth figures put forward by the OECD. Rural and regional Australia is right up there making its contribution. What do we find from the opposition - those who ought to be responsible for putting forward a policy position to this vitally important part of the Australian community? Do we find criticism or objective remarks about the government's policies? No. Worse than that, do we find any ideas at all from the opposition? No. When given an opportunity - a free kick - my opposition spokesman was not even prepared to respond to an invitation to speak to a journalist about an article on reform in rural and regional Australia. I think that says it all.</DOC>

This government is in the business of ending strikes and opposing strikes, not supporting them or fanning them like the opposition do. Workers at Tristar have now had their entitlements protected. They have had their entitlements protected because the company offered them an insurance policy. What the company did not do, would not do and will not do is support the Manusafe scheme - the scheme that the Leader of the Opposition supports, the scheme the opposition supports and the scheme which will ultimately add 19 per cent to payroll costs and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs across the manufacturing industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Some information has come to my attention that there are people in Australia advocating higher taxes. - No, I have been watching TV. Everybody would know, and I think the ABC would know, that I am an avid watcher of the 7.30 Report. Last night there was a story regarding school funding which reported that, while the Howard government maintains that some states, which are primarily responsible for public school funding, are failing, five Labor ministers are preparing to convince voters otherwise. They have set up a task force to demonstrate that the Commonwealth should pitch in more and are considering mounting an advertising campaign. One proposal for raising extra money for public schools is an education levy similar to the Medicare levy. That is from five Labor ministers. The 7.30 Report went to Professor Simon Marginson. Professor Simon Marginson is the author of that much vaunted document that was released at the Sydney Institute, formerly known as Knowledge Nation but now known as the noodle nation. Simon Marginson said this on the 7.30 Report: I suspect there's probably sufficient community support for that - that is, the education levybecause people do want to pay more taxes if they know it's going to go to education.Professor Marginson costed Knowledge Nation at $12 billion per annum. He was the author of the report that the Leader of the Opposition relied on when he was still talking about knowledge nation. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects. He says, `Where does he sit on that side?' Let me ask him: where does the member for Lyons sit on that side? According to the AAP report this morning, on his way into the parliament -  -  - You can always tell when they interject the loudest, Mr Speaker, that they are showing great excitement at the quote which is about to come. According to the AAP report, the member for Lyons told reporters on his way into parliament:Levies for one thing or another (are) being touted around ... I think it's because in Australia we've got into low-taxing regime.People on this side would probably agree that we have got into a low taxing regime - and we remember that the Labor Party fought us every single step of the way as we went into it. The member for Lyons went on to say:I think people are looking for higher revenues. People are starting to realise that services can only be provided by having a tax regime that can pay for those services ... and whether that's an environmental levy, or whether it's a levy for education, or whether it's a levy to send troops to East Timor, it's one way of us funding our future services.Let us make it clear: a levy on incomes is increasing income taxes. The Manager of Opposition Business has just been up to have a little chat with him. He probably went up to pull a lever, so that his chair would open up and he would disappear into the floor. - Don't you sometimes wish that the ground would just open up and you could fall through - the member for Lyons does. So the member for Lyons is into higher income taxes; Professor Simon Marginson is into higher income taxes; five Labor ministers are into higher income taxes; the member for Fremantle is into education bonds; and the Leader of the Opposition is into mezzanine finance - noodle finance for the noodle nation. So we are going to have some noodle finance now. All of this is in the context of an opposition which says it is going to roll backwards on GST, it is going to spend more money and it is going to have bigger surpluses. It is going to spend more, it is going to tax less and it is going to have more left over at the end of the day. Why didn't we think of that? You tax less, you spend more and you have more at the end of the day - in 5½ years they have come up with a genius of an idea!</DOC>

 - Tristar did not compromise. They opposed Manusafe at the beginning and they opposed Manusafe at the end. Tristar offered an insurance bond to their workers a week before this strike finished and it was completely rejected by the Metal Workers Union, with the full support of the Leader of the Opposition, because they were pursuing political objectives, not industrial objectives. Let me also remind members opposite that this government sought to intervene before the commission in support of a return to work application. We supported a return to work application. I did not see any support for a return to work application from members opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question and his interest. The economic survey on Australia's performance and projection for the future that has been released by the OECD is quite outstanding. Of course, there has been a significant contribution from Australia's exporting industries in that performance. This document is a glowing endorsement of Australia's economic performance. I believe it is a clear recommendation why Australians should not elect a Labor government at the end of this year. All the indicators in this document reinforce the importance of the policy settings that our government has put in place since we came to office in 1996.Prior to the government coming to office in 1996, we earned about $99 billion from our exports. This year, we are on track to earn $153 billion from exports - a 54 per cent increase. That is the significant contribution that exports have made to that growth in our economy during that period. Also, the OECD report indicates that the economy is likely to grow between 3.5 and four per cent in 2002, which is described by the OECD as remarkable in the face of slowing world growth. All that is built on a number of indicators that were highlighted in the report. Some of the key findings in the report were that company profitability is strong and corporate balance sheets are in good shape. GDP growth is projected to pick up to 3.5 per cent to four per cent. There have been no major second-round inflation effects from GST. The 2001-02 Commonwealth budget remains focused on preserving the significant consolidation gains achieved in recent years. The underlying budget position is sound, and Commonwealth net debt has fallen sharply, surpassing the government's target to halve the ratio from its 1995-96 level, and major economic benefits should accrue from the comprehensive tax reforms that have been implemented.One of the more interesting statistics in the document is a graph of the differential between interest rates in Australia and one of our major trading partners, the US. It indicates that the difference between Australian and US interest rates is now less than half of one per cent. Under Labor, Australians were paying more than three per cent more than Americans. That was the result of Labor's lazy policies of that time. The graph indicates how the competitive nature of our economy has significantly improved under the reform regimes that we have introduced, with tax reform, industrial relations reform, and the removal of $3½ billion of taxes off the back of our exports to achieve that $153 billion figure. What are the risks? The OECD says that Australia should continue with this positive outlook for the economy, provided there are no major economic imbalances. We should ask ourselves: what could those imbalances be? We have seen a number of comments recently, as has been outlined in the media and here in the House. Labor believes, and the Leader of the Opposition believes, that Australians do not pay too much tax. Labor would have to raise taxes to pay for all the Beazley-Crean promises. Now we have seen the Democrats saying that taxes are not too high and that they would block any proposals in the Senate for tax cuts. The Democrats have given a green light to the Labor Party to increase taxes. If the Labor Party is elected at the end of this year, there will be no opposition in the Senate regarding increasing the taxes that we have worked so hard to remove from the backs of Australian exporters. They will put back on again the $3½ million worth of tax cuts off exporters if a Labor government are elected at the end of this year. As I have said, the OECD has said that Australia should continue with its positive outlook for the economy, provided there are no major economic imbalances. The only economic imbalance on the horizon in Australia is a Beazley-Crean imbalance.</DOC>

 - Just so that I can satisfy the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Speaker -  - And I am answering it, Mr Speaker. Let me make it very clear that the Tristar strike, from the beginning, was supported by the opposition. From the beginning it was opposed by this government. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. On the Meet the Press program last Sunday, Paul Bongiorno asked a question about the Tristar strike. He said:  A lot of jobs are at stake there. Do you support the strike?And the answer was, `Well, I do.' And that was from the shadow minister for employment, the member for Dickson. - I will read the rest, `Well, I do support the strike.' That is what she said. Let me quote her exactly. She said:Well, I do, in that workers have a very important right to pursue their legal entitlements.You support the strike. It is as simple as that. -  - It is as simple as that, Mr Speaker. Labor supports strikes and this government opposes them. That is the simple truth. Labor supports strikes and this government tries to end them. This government is extremely pleased that this particular strike is over. It was a strike against the national interest. It was a strike that was costing Holden alone $120 million in lost sales, and it was putting 12,000 decent Australians out of work.This government had two objectives in this dispute. Its first objective was to get people back to work and its second objective was to stop industry-wide pattern bargaining in support of the dangerous Manusafe proposal. As a result, in part, of this government's work, the people at Tristar are back at work. Their entitlements are protected, but not by the union controlled, job destroying Manusafe fund. Unfortunately, the AMWU has not given up its Manusafe campaign. It still wants to force businesses to pay up to 19 per cent of payroll into a union controlled fund to protect so-called entitlements which may never crystallise. This union, the AMWU, has threatened further industrial action against 600 businesses, large and small, across our economy, and that industrial action will have the full support of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition never condemned the Tristar strike. He never opposed Manusafe and he never provided leadership. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition supported the strike; the member for Dickson supported the strike; they all supported the AMWU. They have got to support the AMWU because the unions and the party are all part of the same ACTU-Labor Inc. political-industrial complex, designed to ensure government of the unions, by the unions, for the unions. - Members opposite always support the AMWU. They cannot afford not to support the AMWU. In the last year for which figures are available, the AMWU gave them $680,000. - Members opposite have to support the AMWU because the AMWU has the largest single bloc vote inside the Labor Party. - In any choice between the union interest and the national interest, the Leader of the Opposition can be relied upon to take the union interest. In any industrial conflict, the Leader of the Opposition will always stand -  - In any industrial dispute anywhere in this country, the Leader of the Opposition can always be found standing shoulder to shoulder with union militants, as was revealed by the celebrated Sydney Morning Herald photograph on 13 July.</DOC>

 - I have no reason to doubt the Leader of the Opposition's statement that the company is in fact paying 1.5 per cent for the insurance bond. But Manusafe, the scheme that this strike was over -  - This dispute was about Manusafe, and Manusafe requires up to 19 per cent of payroll. That is what the company rejected and that is what they were right to reject.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to report to the House that, at long last, the bottom of Australia's wool stockpile is in sight. And, as it goes, the memories of another Labor Party failure will finally be erased for the farmers of Australia. There are fewer than 2,000 bales of wool left in the stockpile as we speak, and that is expected to be sold over the next few days. As a result, I introduced legislation to the House today to wind up early Woolstock Australia, the body that has been charged with managing the wool stockpile, and so the funds can be quickly returned to those growers who have endured the pain of the interest charges and the depressed market over a long period of time. It will be a historic day when the last of the 4.7 million bales from the stockpile is finally disposed of. A debt of $2.8 billion has already been fully repaid and, at last, there are some returns going to the wool growers. It was an extraordinary period of Australian history, a legacy of remarkable policy failure by Labor when in government. The whole of the wool debacle can be traced back to some inappropriate comments by the Labor agriculture minister of the day who destroyed confidence in the wool market, which immediately resulted in a depressed market and began a disastrous decade for the wool producers of Australia. As this stockpile rolls out the door we wipe out a memory yet again of Labor's disastrous term in government.I congratulate Woolstock and Don McGauchie, his board and staff for the prompt and efficient way in which they have cleaned up this Labor Party mess. It has taken us six years to get rid of what Labor destroyed over their 13 years. Wool can be traded fairly and freely in the marketplace for the first time in decades. The trading will be done without being depressed by the massive stockpile, which has certainly overlaid every sale and trade for more than a decade. It is a new beginning for the wool industry, an opportunity for that industry to take advantage of the improved market situation around Australia. What they most certainly do not want, which would undermine the potential for progress and development in the wool industry, would be a return of a Labor government; a return to the same sort of policies -  high interest rates, high taxes - and the sort of regime that damaged Australia's greatest primary industry for such a long period of time. They can now look to the future with confidence as this memory of Labor's failure is finally rolled out the door.</DOC>

That is the scheme that is being promoted by the Leader of the Opposition's friend Dougie Cameron, Dougie Cameron's mate over there -   - I was asked about Labor's entitlements policy. It is Manusafe, the policy of Dougie Cameron, the Leader of the Opposition's mate. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson, who has a very keen interest in supporting families, as indeed do all of the coalition. We would like to see an innovative policy from the opposition - we would like to see just one. We wait for a policy, and so do the Australian public. But certainly this government is getting on with the job of providing a better deal for Australian families, and we are very proud of that. Firstly, the Howard-Anderson government is providing good economic management through lower interest rates, and by providing the lowest inflation we have had for decades, making home ownership far more affordable and increasing employment. But one of the greatest achievements is in the area of family assistance where over 2.2 million Australian families - four million children - now receive 20 per cent more in family assistance than they ever would have got under the Australian Labor Party. You have to also ask yourself about child care. I have not had one question on child care from the opposition in the last 12 months. They are silent, and why? Because we have a terrific story to tell on child care. Child care today is nine per cent cheaper than it was 12 months ago, and the reason for that is the introduction of the new taxation system and the increased affordability of child care. But the opposition have not asked one question. They are very opportunistic about child care but they have not asked one question.This graph says it all. It is a very good document put out by Family and Community Services which shows a significant increase in the funding of child care. Thirty per cent more has been spent on child care than in the last four years of the Labor government. Indeed, over the next four years, $6 billion will be spent on child care. That is why it has become far more affordable, and that is why today, as opposed to a year ago when there were 450,000 children in Commonwealth funded child care, there are 700,000 children in child care.The New South Wales Labor government have not increased funding for preschools since the day they were elected. Shame on them. They have frozen funding for preschools since they came into government back in the mid-1990s. And they claim that they are the family-friendly party. They are not that at all. Of course they have got no credibility. - Another area where this government has a proud record is in our Reconnect program to help young families, whether it is trying to keep families together through our Stronger Families and Communities Strategy or the fight that we have against drugs - and we know that the opposition's policy is totally flim-flam on that issue. Some people are asking, `Where is Labor's plan to help Australian families?' I did find a plan, which quite surprised me. Labor's plan came straight from the Leader of the Opposition himself, when he said, `My plan is to be in the Lodge.' That is the only plan he has. - His one plan is, `My plan is to be in the Lodge.' Don't pack your bags just yet, Leader of the Opposition. When the shadow Treasurer addressed Mission Australia recently, he announced a four-point plan, and this is his four-point plan. - I think you had better get back on your bike, Leo. This is the four-point plan as articulated by the shadow Treasurer in his address to Mission Australia recently. It is Labor's four-point plan which is meant to be family friendly. Point 1 is big budget deficits. That is all they know, as evidenced by the $80 billion deficit that we inherited and that Australian families have to pay for. Point 2 is raising taxes and crippling interest rates, which put many Australian families out of their homes. When the Leader of the Opposition was the finance minister, interest rates were 17 per cent. Point 3 is raising unemployment to massive levels. Point 4, most importantly, is do not upset the unions because they pay the bills, and we have seen that demonstrated very amply in the recent motor industry dispute. </DOC>

 - All those companies to which the Leader of the Opposition refers will go through the kind of bitter industrial disputation to which the Leader of the Opposition refers only if the Leader of the Opposition's friends in the AMWU - his mate Dougie Cameron - force them to. That is the simple truth. I have a letter here addressed to Steve Bracks from the chief executive of one of those companies, Holden. This is one of the companies which is threatened with continuous industrial action by the friends of the Labor Party and by Dougie Cameron, the Leader of the Opposition's best mate. Mr Hanenberger wrote about one way to address this problem. He said: One avenue by which this could be achieved would be by strengthening the federal government's employee entitlements scheme through adoption by those states that have not yet done so.The best thing that could happen to defuse this entitlements issue would be if the state Labor governments supported the federal government's entitlements scheme.</DOC>

 - In reporting to the House on matters that have arisen, according to the member's question, I advise the House that the Gallop Labor government in Western Australia has now incorporated its complete Labor Party policy on the forest industries in terms of the closure of that industry. It is well known that that policy had the complete support of the Leader of the Opposition. As a consequence, there has already been an announcement by the largest employer in the forestry industry in Western Australia, Sotico, that there will be 400 redundancies forthwith in that particular industry. A smaller employer of 10 persons has already lost his forest contract and has been obliged to sack all his employees.We have heard question after question today about the payment of redundancies. The Gallop government has refused to give any assistance in the payment of redundancies to any of those workers. We are not talking about a company that was in full production and that could sell all its products, with its employees having security of employment; we are talking about workers who have lost their jobs because of political expediency, in which the Leader of the Opposition was totally complicit. Those people have not gone back to work; they are finished. They cannot sell their houses. If any apology is needed in this place today, it is needed from the Leader of the Opposition to those people and their families. As for the employer who had to sack all 10 of his employees, three of those people have got redundancy assistance. But there are other activities going on around Australia - and it is pretty interesting. You can run in this place but you cannot hide. I find in the North Eastern Advertiser, a newspaper published in the remoter parts of Tasmania, that Senator Kerry O'Brien advised in a letter that the Senate passed the government's RFA legislation last year. That is pretty surprising, because I have the Hansard record showing every Tasmanian member voting against it. But to help me out on this matter, just two weeks later in the Burnie Advocate, the shadow minister Mr Ferguson is entreating me to reintroduce the bill. - Yes, he did. We have it here in the newspaper. What is the Labor Party up to? Here we are, Mr Deputy Prime Minister -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I will - but that is not all. During the recess, the Leader of the Opposition decided to visit Eden-Monaro, and station 5AN in Adelaide had an interview with the Bulletin's Tony Wright relating to this visit. During that visit the Leader of the Opposition was out with his members, signing, with a big black pen, pledges to guarantee that he would not sell Telstra. I do not know how big a signature there was on the letter to the Commonwealth Bank employees union but, as I remember - being a member of this place at the time - there was a signature promising never to sell more than 49 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. -  - But, after the signing, Mr Tony Wright of the Bulletin, talking of the Leader of the Opposition, told 5AN's Philip Satchell as follows:Yesterday he was in Eden-Monaro, which is not far from Canberra ...He was, as I said, signing these Telstra guarantees. But Mr Wright goes on to say:Interestingly, Green groups came with a very similar pledge asking him to sign that forests would be protected. But, of course, Eden-Monaro is one of those areas where there are a lot of forest workers and he wasn't going to get into that at all. ... But, when asked to sign the one on the forests of Eden-Monaro he put away the big black pen and got out the prolixity again. I wish I had the time in this place to read the convoluted remarks.  -  - Yes, you can run but you cannot hide in this place. He has got a message in one place and he would not sign.But it gets worse because in many parts of Australia, particularly those associated with the pulp and paper industry, there has been an advocate group of workers known as the A-Team. They have done a wonderful job coming to my office and members' offices, asking for all assistance necessary to maintain a pulp and paper industry in Australia and all the employment that goes with it. One of those areas can be found in the seat of Braddon, another can be found in the seat of Gilmore and still another can be found in the seat of McMillan. These people have now been heavied by the CFMEU to disband, and they thought they might need to get a bit of help from their local member of parliament. They have written to me:This is particularly relevant, given the unusual special relationship between the CFMEU and our local federal MP, Christian Zahra, which resulted from the union's generous financial support for him at the last election. Since his election, Mr Zahra has steadfastly refused to meet our delegations on important issues, which have impacted on the McMillan electorate. Further, he has extended this ban on any of his constituents, who have happened to be members of the Maryvale A-Team.This is in black and white, signed by a worker living in Maryvale in the McMillan electorate.  -  - I think he is now calling this fellow a liar. -  - Now he says I am a liar. - Everything I have drawn to the attention of the House today is somebody else's words. We have got Kerry O'Brien dreaming: he actually lives in the Senate and thought he had passed the bill. He did not. We have got the shadow minister now thinking, `Golly, gosh, we've offended all these workers and the election is getting close. I wonder if I can sneak down to Tasmania and win a few of them back. I'll tell them I love them.' Then the Leader of the Opposition gets into Eden-Monaro, and what does he do? He is asked to sign a pledge. He was prepared to kill off a thousand jobs in Western Australia to win that election, but when he thinks he might pick up the most marginal seat in the federal election and the greenies say, `Will you sign a pledge for the forest?' he reverts to prolixity. He starts talking. Then we get a person who stood up in this place telling us how committed he is to his electorate but, when a group of independent workers, who get access to my office as a minister whenever they want it, tried to get into his office to tell him their troubles, he was not going to put his CFMEU funding at risk: he would not let them in.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. What I say about federal spending on health is as follows: with our $2.5 billion private health insurance incentive, we have saved and indeed resuscitated private health insurance in Australia. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that you voted against that. The Australian Labor Party voted against saving Australia's private health insurance system. It only passed through the Senate -   - The Leader of the Opposition asked me my attitude towards federal spending on health and I am telling the Leader of the Opposition that we have devoted $2½ billion a year to a private health insurance tax rebate which the Labor Party voted against, and it only passed through the Senate with the support of Senator Harradine after the last election. We have increased by 28 per cent in real terms the federal money going to the states under the Australian health care agreements. We have done those two things and the benefits of those decisions will be ongoing - they do not end at the end of this calendar year. Into the future there will be rising amounts of federal help for health, both in relation to private health insurance and also in relation to public hospitals.But we have done something else that the Labor Party did not support either and that the Labor Party is pledged to roll back if it gets into government: we have introduced a goods and services tax. The great virtue of the goods and services tax for public health is that over the years the states will have more money to spend on their hospitals. Here is a man who says he is the friend of the public hospital, yet he wants to reduce the capacity of the states to fund their public hospitals in the future. As I said to the South Australian Liberal Party at the weekend, he who argues to roll back the GST is arguing to reduce public services; he who argues to roll back the GST, if he is not arguing to reduce public services, is arguing to increase income tax. The GST is a tax that will grow in its receipts with the growth in the economy. Unlike the wholesale sales tax that the Labor Party wanted to keep, the GST revenue will rise as the years go by. The state governments will have more money and they will spend that money on public hospitals and public schools.It passes very strange to me that the Labor Party, which always puts a warm embrace around its commitment to public hospitals and public schools, wants to take away the revenue `iron lung' which will provide all of those services with enormous help as the years go by. My answer to the Leader of the Opposition is that we have provided more money not only for private health insurance and saved it, despite the best efforts of the Labor Party to stop us, but also for public hospitals. And through the GST we are providing the states of Australia with the wherewithal to provide more money for their hospitals.The public hospitals of Australia are owned and operated by the state governments and state health authorities; they are not owned and operated by the federal government. It is our responsibility to give the states enough money to help run those hospitals; we have given them a GST and we have given them a 28 per cent increase in real terms. The Labor Party opposed the GST; the Labor Party opposed the survival of the private health insurance system. It is the Labor Party that has tried to stop this government helping the public hospital system of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question and recognise the concern she shows for Australians who may get into difficulties when they are overseas. The government is deeply concerned about the welfare of the two Australian aid workers, Diana Thomas and Peter Bunch. They were detained in Afghanistan around two weeks ago. My department here in Canberra and also our High Commission in Islamabad - which is the nearest appropriate post to Afghanistan - are doing everything they can, even at this stage, to secure more information about Ms Thomas and Mr Bunch and to get consular access to them. We are working very closely with the German and American governments, as well as the United Nations, in order to try to secure the release of the two Australians. There is no doubt that having the three governments - the German, the United States and the Australian governments - working together in a cooperative way is maximising the effectiveness of any campaign we can run to get the Australians released. But so far I have to say I am very disappointed with the results we have been able to achieve. For example, the Taliban have so far denied all consular access to the detainees. They have also so far refused to extend the Australian Consul's visa and also the visas of the visiting German and American Consuls. As a consequence, if those visas are not extended by tomorrow, they will have to return to Islamabad. The Taliban have agreed to pass on some personal care items that our Consul has taken with him to Kabul, but we do not have any confirmation yet as to whether Ms Thomas or Mr Bunch have received the items.This recent action by the Taliban of arresting eight international and also 16 of their national aid workers is of concern to governments and aid organisations around the world. It is our view that, whatever the private beliefs of the Australians may be, these were people doing good work in Afghanistan helping the Afghan people and this was a humanitarian mission. It is also always deeply regrettable when there is this sort of outcome as a result of humanitarian work. I commend the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, for his appeal to the Taliban for a speedy solution to this problem.I can assure the House that the Australian government will continue to work tirelessly to get Diana Thomas and Peter Bunch released from Afghanistan and we will continue to retain close contact with their families, who have our sympathy and also our support.</DOC>

 - I will, naturally, analyse the figures that have been put forward by the shadow minister regarding the question of bulk-billing. There will probably be something of a genre of questions from the opposition during this question time. Basically the opposition are saying that the federal government is not spending enough money on health and should spend more. I think that is what they are saying, although last week I thought that was only as important as roll-back. A few days before that, of course, it was not as important as roll-back. Our position is very clear: we have devoted record amounts in federal government support for health services in Australia. - Since I was asked the question by the Leader of the Opposition, I have been handed a quite remarkable chart by the Minister for Health and Aged Care. - It shows that since 1997-98 -  - Commonwealth spending has increased each year more than states spending by -  - Resuming the point that I was making, this chart - which I will not display again but which has been displayed for the House to see - is very revealing. It goes to the very point of the credibility of this debate about the adequacy of the provision of public assets for public services. What it demonstrates is that between 1997-98 and 2001-02 -  - This chart demonstrates that, since 1997-98, Commonwealth spending has increased each year more than state spending on public hospitals. Federal spending on publicly owned public hospitals has increased at a faster rate. The total amount that produces the gap is almost $1.5 billion. In other words, over the last four years we have increased our investment - and we are committed to continue this investment - by almost $1.5 billion more than the states. I might add, almost in anticipation of another question I might be asked later on in question time, that it is the same story with public schools. - It was tangentially anticipatory; I was anticipating something in a tangential fashion. I will return to the mainstream of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. I thought he made a reference to the adequacy of federal government support for health. Was I right?Government members - Yes! - The point I was making was that we have helped the states to fund their own hospitals more generously than they have themselves. Over the last four years you have watched us increase our money. The states rip money out of public hospitals and then come running along to us and ask for more so that they can spend the additional money on their own political fantasies instead of spending it on basic government services. If you look at the record of any of the state governments - if you look at the New South Wales government, if you look at the Victorian government - over the last four years, and I do not exempt any of them from this criticism, irrespective of their political colour, I would remind the House that over that period of time we have massively increased our contribution - and that increase will go on - but the states all the while have been taking money away from public hospitals and then complaining that we are not providing enough money. They just love hearing from the Leader of the Opposition because, if the Leader of the Opposition ever got into government, he would continue to let the states off the hook; he would continue to adopt a policy of handing over more federal money but not requiring the states to make their contributions. The states have a responsibility to fund their own hospitals. We have a responsibility to help, and we are being more than helpful. They are letting the public hospitals down, and the Leader of the Opposition ought to be training his gun sights on them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I can inform him that, last Friday, the ABS released the international merchandise trade figures for the June quarter of 2001 which showed the Australian trade picture for the full year ending June 2001. The figures show us that the Australian trade balance was the largest surplus since 1991-92, a surplus of $1.3 billion in merchandise trade and, more particularly, a surplus that was done on the back of rising exports - unlike the last trade surplus of 1991-92 which was caused by Labor's recession. The honourable member for Hinkler will be pleased to know that the trade in exports of rural commodities over the year was up by 20.6 per cent. So Australia's farmers are leading the way in increasing Australia's export trade, with a 20.6 per cent increase in rural commodities over the last year.Elaborately transformed manufactures exports rose by 16 per cent over the course of the year. This was led by motor car exports, which grew by 36½ per cent, and an increase in the export of medicinal and pharmaceutical products of 30.1 per cent. To break down the trade into destinations: our trade surplus with Japan increased by 24.7 per cent in goods exports; our trade with the United States rose by 21.4 per cent; and our trade with Taiwan, Singapore and Korea rose in terms of exports by 25 per cent, 23.5 per cent and 20.9 per cent respectively. So the good news is that, in a world where growth is slowing very considerably, especially in the United States and Japan, Australian exports grew. One of the reasons they grew, particularly in relation to the United States, was the exchange rate factor; but, in addition to that, taking taxes off exports gave Australian exporters a fair go for the first time in decades. When we reformed the taxation system we took $3½ billion in taxes off exports. We were opposed every step of the way but we wanted Australian exporters to have the same opportunity that other countries gave their exporters. Other countries took taxes off exports and Australia never did until there was a government that had the courage to reform the Australian taxation system on 1 July last year. Obviously, the situation in other economies of the world is still slowing; for example, in the United States and in Japan. Australia is currently one of the strongest growing economies of the developed world, contrary to all of the predictions that were made by the Australian Labor Party. I pay tribute to Australia's exporters and to Australia's export results. This is a magnificent result for Australian export: a merchandise trade surplus led by Australia's exporters, the highest since recession in 1991-92. I particularly want to pay tribute to the farmers and rural producers of Australia who led the way in that performance. </DOC>

 - As I always do, I will naturally examine the circumstances of the constituent mentioned by the honourable member. But, talking generally about the issue, one of the things I would do is to suggest to the honourable member that he ring Craig Knowles and demand an explanation from the New South Wales health minister as to why New South Wales is not putting in as much money into their own hospitals as we are. I think that is the question that ought to be asked. If I were the member I would take very careful stock, as no doubt he will, of the preparation of the Labor Party's roll-back plans for the federal election. I have no doubt that all of the members of caucus will be consulted about what items ought to be rolled back. They will all be brought into the inner circle; I am quite certain that they will all be ushered into the leader's office and will be invited to make their contributions. The Manager of Opposition Business seems to be running the opposition's agenda. Over the last couple of weeks he has taken over the political agenda from the Leader of the Opposition. I wonder which shadow minister it will be next - maybe the member for Brisbane will take it over next week. - I am always touched by relations between leaders and their backbench.  -  - Anything to get them excited. They have got me again - I give in; I surrender. I will not personalise it between the member for Chifley and his leader, but I suggest the member for Chifley read a letter - and I will send him a copy - which was sent by Mr David Hamill, who is the Treasurer and the member for Ipswich - Government members - Was! - That is right; he was. When he wrote this letter, he was Treasurer. He wrote this letter on 18 January 2000, and I will read it very carefully so the member for Chifley might take it in. He was writing to the federal Treasurer, and he said:As you are aware, broadening the existing list of GST-free items - that is, roll-back - has the potential to adversely impact on the quantum of GST revenues that are available for distribution to the Commonwealth and state-territory governments for the delivery of core services. What Mr Hamill was arguing -  - The point that was being made in Mr Hamill's letter - and it remains as valid today as it was in January of last year when it was written - is that if you reduce the GST reach, you are reducing the capacity of state governments to fund the operation of public hospitals. In those circumstances -  - Mr Speaker, the question -  - Mr Speaker, the question was based on arguments about the adequacy of federal government funding for health. I am simply making the point that in every area we have provided assistance, and in all of those areas the opposition opposed the provision of that assistance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I can tell the House, as most people who have been in this House for the last three years would know, that the Labor Party have been telling Australia that the worst thing imaginable for the Australian economy is the GST. The thing that they are absolutely committed to, more than anything else, is rolling it back - except that the Labor Party never use the term `roll-back' these days. It has been replaced with a new phraseology: it is now called `GST tax cut'. It is so hard to get them to use the term `roll-back', but it was not always thus. Roll-back was announced at the ALP conference in Queensland on 13 June 1999.  - Here we are in the past, says the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. You say to him, `roll-back was announced in June 1999' - roll-back is now in the past, is it? Opposition members - You are! - We talk about roll-back and he accuses us of being in the past. I do not know why we get so confused. We take all of our information from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He was asked this: `With the roll-back, are you talking about dismantling the GST?' His answer: `Anything that you can conceivably think of is implicated in the term 'roll-back'.' Back in those days, roll-back was huge - because the GST was so terrible, so monstrous. Anything you could think of was implicated in roll-back.Then, as the months went by and the opportunistic attempt to profit out of opposing what was good for Australia began to fall apart, roll-back began to diminish and it became the policy which could no longer stand by its name. By the time we got to the Aston by-election, the Labor Party had a totally different tack. By the time we got to the Aston by-election, the Leader of the Opposition was saying, `Oh, no, tax is not too high. What people want is more spending on health and education.' When we said, `More spending on health and education would mean higher income taxes,' the Leader of the Opposition lasted about two hours before he called another press conference and said that he was not in favour of more spending on health and education if it meant higher taxes. Then we had the extraordinary view this week where, of all people, the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs was sent out to announce a new tax policy. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, obviously knowledgable on tax policy and roll-back and in charge of the policy, said that tax cuts were a second order issue. Why did he say they were a second order issue? Because he had read the polls that morning that said that people wanted more spending. So he said: The way the tax cut is delivered and the extent of the tax cut are second issues to Australians compared to initiatives about health and education.So now the Labor Party are back to, `We're going to forget about GST roll-back; we are now in favour of more spending.' Then the press went to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is responsible for tax policy, and asked, `Are you in favour of more spending on health and education? Are you giving away roll-back? Is it a second order issue to you?' The journalist on AM asked:What is Labor's top priority? Rollback or investment in social service? He asked, `What is your top priority - less revenue or more spending?' The answer was `Both. My priorities are both. As a top priority, I am both in favour of rolling back revenue and in favour of more spending.' - As I said in the parliament last week, why didn't we think of that as a policy - less revenue and more spending? Why has this idea avoided the government for so long; that is, that you can roll back the GST, spend more on health, spend more on education and you can have bigger surpluses -  - and all of that with no downside for the Australian public? We had the Beazley pre-Aston position, the Beazley post-Aston position, the McMullan position post the survey and the Crean position post McMullan. McMullan rolls back Beazley, Crean rolls back the roll-back on Beazley and roll-back heads north while it is heading south. If you ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, `What is your priority - going north or going south?' he will say `Both - I'll go north and then I'll go south and then I'll go north again.' He goes around in this ever-diminishing circle of policy. If you are going to be brave about this line - and today they are back on more spending on health and education -  - That is today's policy - they are back on that. If you are going to be brave about spending more on health and education, you should do two things. Firstly, you should announce the death of roll-back. Let us inter it. Let us have a funeral. Let us say, `This was the policy that never came about. It was cheap and it was opportunist, and the good thing about it is that it died before it ever saw the light of day.' Secondly, you should come out and say, `What's more, we are so in favour of more spending that we are going to do what we did after the 1993 election: we're going to put up income tax rates.' Then people will start believing you about more spending on health and education. We have sat in this parliament while this government has reformed the taxation system - while it has done all of the heavy lifting - and we have seen weak, cheap, populist policy oppose it, and before it even gets to the election it starts falling apart. It is about time the Labor Party decided where it stood, because nobody else can figure out for a moment where that is.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, that program was not scrapped. That program was a four-year program which was allowed to continue, and that was the end of it. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that, under the new taxation arrangements, the state of Queensland will be better off earlier than any other state. The greatest beneficiary under the new taxation arrangements is the state of Queensland. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he is to have any credibility as a national political leader, he ought to require the state leaders of his own party to bear their own constitutional responsibilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question and for her interest in this matter of the large number of unlawful arrivals who access Australia, the extent to which there is considerable delay in determining the claims that some may present for refugee status, and some of the reasons for that delay. We have seen a good deal of comment in recent months that people are held for long periods of time. The fact is, of course, that most people who come to Australia unlawfully, if they come with documents that can prove who they are, are able to get prompt decisions from us; some will have decisions in as few as four weeks. Others who do not present with documentation, who often try to conceal their identity and whose circumstances and experiences are not necessarily clear, can get decisions in as few as 14 or 15 weeks, and that occurs in 80 per cent of cases.The sorts of people who find that they are detained for much longer periods are those being held for removal or those who seek to access all the opportunities available for appeal. The appeal system in Australia does mean that some people can access not only a first tier decision by the department but also an independent review by a qualified tribunal. They can then get before a judge of the Federal Court, they can get before three judges of the Federal Court, they can get before seven judges of the High Court of Australia - and they can still present their cases to me on humanitarian grounds, and in some cases they can go off to the United Nations. That situation has been long known. The Labor Party when it was in office tried to get rid of that system. It wanted the tribunal decisions to be final and determinative, and it introduced provisions in the Migration Act to achieve that outcome. Those provisions have not achieved that outcome, because section 75 of the Constitution says that you cannot limit people's access to the High Court if they wish to have it.So is there another way? The government took advice on this matter from some of the leading counsel in Australia, and the advice was that, if we use what is known as a privative clause - a clause which boosts the authority of the tribunal that first makes the decision - that would exclude most people from being able to access our courts for judicial review. It does not in any way limit the constitutional provision, but it does ensure that you can get quick, final and determinative decisions, that you can remove these allegations of injustice that people are being held too long, and that you can save the Australian taxpayers money - which the honourable member for Bowman often laments about. I have been asked whether there are any other views. I have found some other views. I found in the Australian of 30 July that the Labor Party now says it has a plan and it is going to take a `radically different approach', particularly in relation to the `push to restrict court appeals'. Its radical plan, which was to avoid an `unconstitutional breach of the separation of powers doctrine' was in fact to order the courts to speed up the process. I cannot think of anything more calculated to offend the separation of powers doctrine than to give the judges some direction about the way in which they ought to deal with the cases before them.Further, I found that when he was considering the matter on 9 August the shadow minister suddenly thought, `Well, maybe it's not unconstitutional,' because at a Racial Respect Conference he had this to say:We say no, that is against the separation of powers doctrine, probably the High Court would throw it out as being unconstitutional, and we want to help them from themselves.We are not sure what that meant, that he wants to help us from ourselves. It seems that the Leader of the Opposition has picked up on this, because the Courier-Mail today states:But Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said Australia's legal system was based on the appeal process and it was enshrined in the Constitution.Some members are wondering where I am leading in relation to that - I hear some noise opposite. Privative clauses are not new. They were upheld by the High Court in Hickman's case, and used to limit the rights of primarily Australians to access the courts to appeal decisions from tribunals.Most of the legislation in which privative clauses have been used were introduced by Mr Chifley when he was Prime Minister, and he did that in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904; it was certainly done by Mr Hawke in the Industrial Relations Act 1998; it was done by Curtin in the National Security (Coal Mining Industry) Employment Act; it was done by Chifley in the stevedoring industry act; it was done by Curtin again in the Coal Production Wartime Act. Mr Speaker, I would not want to keep the House so long. It has been done in many enactments at a Commonwealth level. It has been utilised by the states in a number of areas. We have here a situation in which the Labor Party wants to preclude Australians from being able to access appeals, because it wants to boost the decisions of tribunals. When it comes to people who are non-Australians abusing the asylum system, it wants to ensure that they have access to the most comprehensive appeals system imaginable - one which not only is supported by Australian taxpayers but which deprives people of what they are seeking: a prompt, fair and quick system in which their claims can be validly determined. I table the list of enactments in which privative clauses have been used both at a Commonwealth and at a state level.</DOC>

 - The record of this government in providing additional resources to health in this country is quite outstanding, and it is not something that finished with the last budget. We provided an increase, via the Australian health care agreements, of something in the order of 28 per cent in real terms over the next five years. In case those opposite did not listen, let me repeat: we put $2.5 billion into saving private health insurance. That has not only dramatically lifted the number of people covered by private health insurance because we have made it more affordable; it has also taken some of the load off the public hospital system.In addition to that, we have committed 28 per cent more in real terms under the Australian health care agreements. I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that two budgets ago we doubled the federal government provision for health and medical research in this country as a result of the recommendation of the Wills committee. That is an investment that had been allowed to waste under previous Labor governments, and we in fact have doubled it. So that is the third great thing that we have done for health in this country. The fourth thing that we have done is something that we have done for the capacity of this country to provide ever growing amounts of revenue for public services years into the future - that is, we have introduced a broad based indirect tax that will provide a growing revenue base for state governments to fund essential public services. Two of the great public service responsibilities of state governments in this country are government schools and public hospitals. Both of those things are the responsibility of state governments. So what you have is a picture quite specifically in relation to health where we have provided ever growing amounts of money. In relation to the generic capacity of state governments to boost public services, we have provided a growing revenue base.This issue is very interesting. I was asked a question by the leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition. When you go through the performance of some of the states, the figures you get are very interesting. I quoted earlier the gap, the $1.5 billion shortfall from state governments for public hospitals over the last four years - that is a $1.5 billion shortfall from all state governments. When I go through the list, I find that between financial year 2000-01 and financial year 2001-02, under the Australian health care agreements - that is the money we pay direct to state governments to help run the Medicare system and to help keep public hospitals going - our Australian health care funding rose by six per cent, while Mr Carr's funding in New South Wales, through his minister Craig Knowles, rose by only 1.9 per cent, despite the fact that these are New South Wales government hospitals. We do not run those hospitals - we do not have the primary responsibility for them - any more than we run the government school system. Year after year you have seen state governments thieving money from public hospitals and public schools, while the federal government has progressively increased the amount. Yet, on top of that, what does the federal leader of the Labor Party want to do? He wants to lift your income tax so that state Labor premiers can be further let off the hook. That is unacceptable to us.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The Coastwatch organisation today has available to it 1,800 sea days a year provided by Royal Australian Navy patrol boats, and it also has available to it 250 hours of Orion aircraft managed and operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. I want to compliment those members of the Australian Defence Force on the fantastic job that they do. I think it ought to be publicly recognised that they operate at the highest professional standards.  - If it is correct, Mr Speaker, as is interjected by the opposition, why is it that the Leader of the Opposition was out over the weekend, basically canning the efforts of Coastwatch, which is today bulwarked by the workers of the Australian Defence Force? - I note what the interjector says. This is the comment of the Leader of the Opposition when talking about the effectiveness of the existing operations: `There are a lot of people entering this country illegally who don't get caught.' The detection rate is 98.6 per cent. In the face of a 98.6 per cent detection rate, the Leader of the Opposition uses that as his excuse, as his reason, for proposing the alternative coast guard operation. What the Leader of the Opposition does not tell you is that, when he was the defence minister, he examined this issue and concluded that a coastguard would not be more effective; that it would be less effective, but at an additional cost of $2 billion. I note that a parliamentary committee have taken some public evidence on what is the most efficient way of managing this issue. They heard from former commissioners of the Australian Federal Police, and the current head of Customs said:There is a possibility of competition rather than complementarity in that and, frankly, duplication of resources. In other words, when you look behind the populist language of the Leader of the Opposition, you find that in the past he has opposed that which he is now proposing. He today proposes a coast guard which would cost $2 billion, on his own calculations, for a system which would be less effective than that which operates now. This is the worst case possible of opposition populism, out there attacking those Australians in the Australian Defence Force who are doing an excellent job - the figures support that - using their good efforts. We say that this coastguard proposition is a complete furphy and ought to be rejected - and it is.</DOC>

 - I read the article -  - I read the article by Mr Keith Moore in the Herald Sun this morning, and I saw an article which showed that the information in that article had been obtained from the information that we put on the public record. Furthermore, both the agency and the department have had very solid discussions with Mr Moore, and he had, I believe, presented a very balanced article. The point, if I can make it, is this: we lifted the carpet on what was left behind by the Labor Party after 13 years in government. We have put in place a reform package that means that now all homes have to meet higher standards than were ever envisaged by the Labor Party, which itself commissioned no less than two reports on aged care which it never, ever responded to.I would point out that those reports referred to in that newspaper article are indeed ones which are valid at the time they are put onto the Internet; but, so that people can be reassured, I can say that all of the 11 homes that were noted in that article as having a critical rating no longer have a critical rating. In the case of Anzac and RSL Park homes, an administrator has been appointed and each of those is no longer critical. In the case of Isomer, it has had its site audit and, for reaccreditation, is no longer critical. Good Shepherd at Maryville now has two years accreditation and is no longer critical. Gualtiero Vaccari, two homes, received one year originally and has a reaudit scheduled for 8 October, is progressing well and is no longer critical. Lewis Court has a reaccreditation site audit for 2 and 3 October and is no longer critical. Radford has a reaccreditation site audit for 9 and 10 October, is progressing well and is no longer critical. St Francis of Assisi, two homes, has a reaccreditation audit for October and is no longer critical. Melton, where an adviser has been appointed, is no longer critical and is seeking reconsideration for accreditation. The point I am making is that this is a system that is working. We are dealing here with human beings, who will sometimes fall below the standards. Those homes represent about four to five per cent of all homes in Victoria, which means that 95 to 96 per cent of all homes are meeting the standards. I think that the Labor Party's attempts to play politics with older Australians, their welfare and their quality of life are indeed not fair to the people who are giving good care and giving good outcomes for the quality of life of frail, older Australians who need that care. Indeed, the Labor Party's cynicism, given their failure to act in 13 years despite the fact that they had audit reports, is testimony to the fact that they would rather play politics with older people's lives than actually do anything about the matter. This system is working and it is working well. We will always have some homes that will fall below the standard, but it is important that we come to know about them so that something can be done about it. I might add that I understand that the member for Hotham was conducting over the weekend a call-in system about aged care homes in Adelaide. It was advertised there. The state manager of the Department of Health and Aged Care has written to Mr Crean and stated that, if any information came forward that would show that there is any substandard care for any individuals, he must let the department know immediately so that something can be done about it, and that we are not playing politics with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. I am happy to report to her and to the House that the government's program to upgrade Australia's quarantine service is now well advanced and already achieving significant outcomes. There has been a 145 per cent increase in the number of quarantine seizures at our mail centres and airports, compared with this time last year, and a 121 per cent increase in the number of on-the-spot fines issued. As part of this upgrade, quarantine service staff at the border will increase by 70 per cent, we will be tripling the number of dog detector teams, and the number of x-ray machines will be increased from nine to 58. This, of course, is actually the second major increase in quarantine expenditure and upgrading of border activities since this government came to office. I heard the shadow minister intervening, suggesting that things must have been bad before. Well, they were bad under the opposition; they were dreadful under the Labor Party. Under the ALP, funding for the quarantine service was actually reduced. It is quite extraordinary that we have the opposition now rushing around talking about a $500 million coast guard, even though when they were in office they actually cut expenditure on border patrol activities. Indeed, under this government, the number of people involved on full-time border activities in the quarantine service will rise from the 400 when Labor was in office to 1,400. That demonstrates clearly the different attitude between a coalition government and Labor to these vital issues.Occasionally, some people would like us to believe that perhaps Labor have changed and that they would do it differently next time. But, if you have any doubt about where Labor's attitude is on these sorts of questions, just look at the Labor states. At the same time as the Commonwealth is increasing expenditure on quarantine, the state Labor governments are winding back their capacity to deal with plant and animal diseases. The honourable member for Dawson, being a Queenslander, would be interested in the performance of the Beattie government, which has slashed the number of full-time staff in its market access and development division - while increasing its responsibilities - from 558 to 481 in just a short period of time. So it is reducing the capability of the program to deal with these sorts of issues at the same time as the Commonwealth is providing additional expenditure. It reminds me a little bit of some of the questions we have heard earlier today about health and education. The states wind back their efforts - Labor winds back its efforts -  when the Commonwealth increases the effort, and then they complain that there is not enough expenditure in that field. Labor's record is well and truly clear: it wound back quarantine services when it was in office - it wound them back; it rolled them back - and Labor in office at the state level is also winding back its capacity to deal with pests and diseases. It is only a coalition government that will take strong and effective action in relation to quarantine. It is only a coalition government that can be counted upon to protect our clean and green image and to keep our borders safe.</DOC>

 - First and foremost, I have no idea whether or not this particular firm has made a donation to the Liberal Party, and furthermore, if I can say, presumably the Labor Party do not think that donations to political parties are immoral or they would not accept $5 million a year from the unions. - Now to go to the substance of the question, which relates to the Templestowe Nursing Home, which the agency found to have serious risk and where action needed to be taken. The department and the agency had worked with the home and the management to bring it up to standard over a period of six months. It had worked with it assiduously and it was determined that, despite their good efforts, the provider would not meet the required standards. The approved provider was required to sell that business in order that the residents could have good continuity of care. The policy has remained the same under us as it was under the previous government. - When licences are allocated to approved providers, they gain a capital gain when they sell those beds. That is the way the system has always been. Of course, it does underwrite any entitlements for employees who may leave their employ at the time. To go to the sale to the new approved provider, the important thing is this: it has gone to an approved provider who does have a good track record within the industry. It is important, we consider, that we remove the serious risk and that we remove the impediments to good care rather than remove the residents. The point is that this particular purchaser has given notice that over time he intends to close that home at Templestowe, but under the act every resident must be placed in suitable alternative accommodation, and this will happen over a period of time. He may not merely close a home.The second point that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition was the question of extra service. Extra service is permitted to take up only 12 per cent of all places that are allocated. In fact, it currently runs at about three per cent. Providers must apply within the round and it has to be approved within the department that there are sufficient other places available, particularly for concessional residents, before approval is given for extra-service places to be created. It is incumbent upon someone who applies for extra-service status to prove that they will in fact be giving extra service and that it is not merely what is required under the act. There are people within the community who are prepared to pay more for additional things. That is their choice, and choice is what we are concerned to see. The biggest choice we want is for people to be able to stay home as long as they possibly can, and that is why we have increased community aged care packages up to 25,000, which is an increase of 450 per cent on what you had. I have to say that this system of ours that we have put in place, which has compliance rules and has both the agency and the department involved in seeing that compliance is met, is a successful system - one which the opposition and the Democrats voted on when it went through the Senate, when we implemented the new act. We have finetuned it since then. As I have said before, we will always find some people who fall below the standard and who need to be worked with in order for that standard to again be reached. We are concerned to remove the impediments to good care rather than remove residents.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question, which was extremely well put. Over the weekend, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made an extraordinarily brazen statement. He said:Industrial relations will improve under a Labor government, just as they did when we were in office last time. The lowest level of industrial disputes was under a Labor government.He has a lot of front on this one. -  - He is a front organisation for the ACTU. He is absolutely dead wrong there. Last week, the Australian Bureau of Statistics put out figures showing that in the 12 months to May just 44 working days had been lost per 1,000 employees. That is a 10 per cent decrease on the figures one month earlier, and it is a 56 per cent decrease on one year earlier. It is the lowest figure since this series was first kept in 1982. On other series, industrial disputation is at the lowest figure since records were first kept in 1913. It is true that there has been a recent upsurge in industrial disputation. It is true that some unions are getting in a bit of pre-election muscle flexing. It is true that some of them are putting in some ambit claims in anticipation that the policy of any future government might be pre-emptive surrender to the union movement. What would you expect from an opposition which is nothing but the political wing of the ACTU and which has as its Treasury spokesman one former ACTU president and as its employment spokesman another ACTU president? After the election, no doubt the industry spokesman will be Jennie George, yet another ACTU president. Sometime in the course of the next parliament, no doubt it will make way for Sharan Burrow, yet another ex-ACTU president. By contrast, this government has an extremely good record of helping working families. -  - In 5½ years under this government's policies, average weekly earnings have gone up by some 12 per cent. They went up by just four per cent in the 13 years of the former government. In 5½ years this government has put basic award earnings up by some nine per cent. They actually fell by five per cent when members opposite were in government. Workers are earning more, and getting to keep more of their earnings because this government has put in place the biggest income tax cuts on record. And there are more workers, because we put 800,000 new jobs into the economy in 5½ years.  This morning the Leader of the Opposition was asked a question and in response he said, `What they respond to' - that is to say, what voters respond to - `is positive solutions, and what they vote against is people who have done them damage.' Voters remember the damage that the Leader of the Opposition did, they remember the 20 per cent interest rates that he put on small business, they remember unemployment hitting 11 per cent, and they know that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are the double digit duo when it comes to unemployment. That is why the people of Australia will never replace the best government since Bob Menzies with the worst opposition since Arthur Calwell.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The first point I would make is that this government has made record provision for health in all areas in the time that it has been in government. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that an estimated $31.6 billion is to be paid to the states and territories over the five years of the current arrangements under the Australian health care agreement to help them provide public hospital services to the year 2003. I should remind the Leader of the Opposition that this represents a real increase of about 28 per cent, in comparison with funding provided in the last year of the 1993 Medicare agreement negotiated by the Labor Party when it was last in government. The Commonwealth continues to fund public hospital services at a greater rate than the states and territories. Commonwealth funding is estimated to rise by 6.2 per cent this financial year, while the states' and territories' own source funding will rise by only 3.1 per cent.In the 2001 budget, the one just past, we allocated an additional $750 million over four years to further strengthen Medicare by improving access to primary care services, boosting targeted funding for quality primary care and ensuring safer use of medicines. Key initiatives will increase rebates for some GP services, increase support for after-hours and emergency care services, improve mental health care, provide more support for GP management of asthma and diabetes, and improve participation in screening for cervical cancer.In the area of rural health, in the 2000 budget the government provided $562 million over four years for a regional health strategy under the title `More Doctors Better Services'. This was in addition to $171 million provided in the 1999 budget for rural health. This is in addition to the fact that as a result of the government's initiatives we now have, as of June 2001, 44.9 per cent of the Australian population, or about 8.7 million people, with private health cover - and that is three million Australians more than in December 1998. Three million more people have come into private health insurance under a policy opposed by the Labor Party when it was put up in the parliament, a policy that is worth about $600 a year to a family with private cover, at an estimated cost to the government of $2.2 billion for the current financial year 2001-02.I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the issue he raised and in relation to all other health issues raised by the opposition that one of the most important things that any government can do in the area of health is to make a greater commitment to research in the whole area of health and medical research. In the 1999 budget we committed an additional $614 million over five years to effectively double the amount of money that is going to be provided in relation to health and medical research in this country.When you look back over the record of this government, it has been a government that has provided ongoing and increasing support. The 28 per cent increase will of course be under an agreement that is operative until the year 2003. It is not an increase that stops this year; it keeps on going for the duration of the five-year agreement. I repeat that in the time that we have been in government we have made a record provision for health in all areas, and it is a record that compares very favourably indeed with the performance of the Labor Party when it last had an opportunity to do something instead of wave fanciful ideas around. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. Quite a number of members on this side of the House have in recent times raised with me the issue of Zimbabwe. I particularly acknowledge the interests and concerns of the member for Hinkler in relation to Zimbabwe. He has been very active in promoting the cause of human rights in Zimbabwe. The Australian government is unequivocal in expressing its concern about the continued deterioration of law and order in Zimbabwe, threats to the independence of the judiciary, suppression of critical media, intimidation of the opposition and disrespect for the human rights of Zimbabweans, be they black or be they white. I am not convinced that the Zimbabwean government did all it could to control the recent violence involving black and white Zimbabweans in Chinhoyi. I am pretty convinced that the recent detention of the editor of the Daily News, which is an opposition newspaper, and three of his staff was arbitrary - although I acknowledge that those people have subsequently been released by the Zimbabwean judiciary.This morning I spoke with the Zimbabwean High Commissioner and I made it clear to her that there was very deep concern in the Australian community about the failure to uphold the rule of law in Zimbabwe in the interests of all Zimbabweans, be they black or be they white. I also told the high commissioner that the government's concerns were widely held throughout the Australian community, which has for a long time supported a free and democratic Zimbabwe. Malcolm Fraser's work, for example, in supporting President Mugabe in his early years, in helping him come to office, has been well acknowledged around the world. There is no doubt at all that Australia has done a great deal for that country over many years. We do not have a direct interest in the issue of land reform in Zimbabwe, but we are concerned that in implementing its policy Zimbabwe lives up to its international obligations, particularly in relation to the Harare declaration, which was agreed to at the Harare CHOGM in 1991. I also took the opportunity of explaining to the high commissioner that it was unhelpful in public debate here in Australia for her to describe statements made by members of this House - in this case, the member for Fisher - as `racist'.I regret that Zimbabwe has refused to accept the ministerial mission proposed by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, of which I am a member. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group suggested that a three-minister mission, including me, go to Zimbabwe and have the opportunity to speak to President Mugabe, talk to him about international concerns and, of course, hear his side of the story as well, so that there can be a proper process of Commonwealth involvement and a report by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group of its findings to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Brisbane in October. I think it has been a mistake by President Mugabe to refuse to allow that mission collectively to visit his country, since they can visit individually. As a consequence, this issue will be discussed by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group in London in two weeks time, a meeting that I will attend. There is a proposal for a Commonwealth ministerial meeting to address the issue of Zimbabwe to be held in Abuja, which is the capital of Nigeria, a few days after the CMAG meeting in London.Finally, let me say that I can understand that not only many people in Australia generally but some of the members of this House have a great sense of anger about what has been happening in Zimbabwe to black and white Zimbabweans. I acknowledge that some people have said that President Mugabe should not visit Australia for the CHOGM meeting. They have said that both as a reflection of the interest and concern Australia has for Zimbabwe and of the concern that many Australians have for what has happened there in recent times. I understand that sense of anger, but it is important that people in Australia understand that it is not for the host of any CHOGM meeting to pick and choose who can and who cannot come to that meeting. Obviously, if that were the case, the CHOGM process would not work properly at all. But, if President Mugabe chooses to come to Australia - and at this stage we have no idea whether he will -  it will be an opportunity this government will not miss to take up with him the very great concerns there are in this country about what has been happening in Zimbabwe. </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I will answer his question about the radiation oncology report and then the way forward on that and then about cancer services generally. I am aware of the recently released national strategic plan for radiation oncology. In fact the problems it details have been around for about 20 years. I would say to the honourable member that the single biggest problem in this area is getting enough technicians to deal with the equipment, and this is an international problem. We are facing quite some threats from Canada, which has now realised it is way behind in this area and is heavily recruiting. Some of the states have realised they have a problem here. Queensland, I understand, has recently increased the remuneration for this group of people by 25 per cent to try to keep them. So, even if you put more machines in tomorrow, there would not be the people to operate the machines.The next point I would make is that the figure of 10,000 for people missing out on treatment is in fact wildly inaccurate. This uses a benchmark from North America that 50 to 55 per cent of all people who get cancer should receive radiation oncology treatment, and that is not a figure that is evidence based. The figure came from AHTAC, the Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee; but, if you have a look at their original recommendation in 1996, it did say something like that, in the absence of other benchmarks, this should be considered; but it was not a recommendation. There is no evidence that that is what the benchmark should be in Australia. In Australia we base our health policy as much as we can on an evidence base, not on which part of the medical profession is bleating loudest for more resources for their area.The third thing I would say is that these people are not receiving no treatment; they may be receiving chemotherapy or alternative treatments. The fact is that there is no evidence in Australia that we are getting worse outcomes in cancer treatment than anywhere else in the world; in fact, in many cases we are getting better outcomes. So you could actually make things worse by putting a whole lot of resources into an area where it is not proven that you could get the outcomes.The fourth point I would make is that this report came out because the federal government funded it. It was actually a report that I funded from the Royal Australian College of Radiologists. We have attempted to work through this very, very complex area with state and territory governments. There have been several attempts in the past two decades to deal with this. I might say that some of them under the previous Labor government, as the shadow Treasurer suggests, did come to absolutely nothing whatsoever. So we were prepared to work with the College of Radiologists. We managed to get state and territories together. We have used the health ministers conference to discuss this on a number of occasions, and we are trying to get a strategic approach that can deal with a very complex problem that has a lot of parts and has defied solution previously. It is a great disappointment to me that the College of Radiologists, rather than using the $100,000 that the Commonwealth provided them with to come up with a cooperative strategic plan, have instead produced an audit and chosen to release it in a way to cause the maximum alarm - alarm that is completely unfounded. What you have here is a medical professional group using the run-up to an election in an attempt to gain benefit for themselves in an area where, if you poured more money in it immediately, there is no evidence that you would necessarily make any difference.On cancer generally, let me make just one point, and I will make it very clearly: Labor's entire cancer proposal is funded by wiping out the government's cervical cancer initiative. The Labor Party proposes taking $72 million out of the GP based cervical cancer initiative and putting it -  - I will say it again, Mr Speaker; thank you. The Labor Party is funding its cancer initiative by abolishing an initiative we had in the budget to spend $72 million over the next four years on encouraging general practitioners to screen women with cervical cancer. The Labor Party is instead proposing to set up a bureaucratic system of centres where people will go, but it will not have a GP based system of cervical cancer care. Ninety-one per cent of women in the target group for cervical cancer go to the GP every year. Ninety-seven per cent of women in the target group for cervical cancer go to the GP every two years. There is no better mechanism to try to address this very serious problem.Labor have said they will rip that money out. They will take it away from cervical cancer. The direct result of that is that people will unnecessarily die, and you will set up some crummy little system of clinics around Australia, a new bureaucracy. Mr Speaker, I do get passionate about this because this is incompetence. I will say it quite clearly in this House: if Labor are ever allowed to implement their plan for two and sixpence for everybody with cancer, women will continue to die unnecessarily because of incompetence from the Labor Party. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton. It gives me an opportunity to inform the House of an announcement made by the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources of the commitment of $155 million over five years to finance the enhancement of existing, and the establishment of new, major national research facilities. There were 15 successful projects announced today, and they are projects that are to be found in all states and territories of Australia. They include, for example, the provision of $23½ million to the Gemini and the SKA astronomy projects. The Gemini project will allow Australia to expand its international partnership with other countries in frontier research on the origins of the universe. The SKA facility will assist Australia to attract part of the multibillion dollar global business in astronomical technology to Australia, including the Square Kilometre Array to rural Australia. It also includes $18 million to the national neurosciences facility. This facility will establish a globally competitive national neuroscience cluster recognised as one of the top five world wide and is a preferred location for discovery and clinical product development - and I invite all members of the House to listen very closely to this - by leading pharmaceutical companies, including new drug discoveries in Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and brain damage resulting from trauma and strokes. The funding of this facility will, in particular, give to Australia a world-class capacity to be in the forefront of developments in research, both public and private, in relation to those disabling diseases and diseases which confront just about every Australian family at some stage during their life.It is a very long and impressive list. It represents yet another down payment on the $2.9 billion Backing Australia's Ability program that I announced in January this year. I take the opportunity of observing that this government is acting in relation to science and technology; those opposite are merely waffling. We have in fact put down a $2.9 billion program. It is fully costed. It is completely coordinated. It is comprehensive. It has been widely acclaimed by the scientific community. The important thing is that it is happening - we are making announcements, money is being invested, new research is being encouraged and in every field covered by Backing Australia's Ability there is a new enthusiasm because they know they have a government that has a very strong and ongoing commitment to these very important areas of science and technology. Increasingly, the scientific community is seeing that this government is prepared to invest the money, take the action, give the leadership and encourage the best and the brightest to stay in Australia and to make their contribution to keeping Australia punching well above her weight in areas of science, medical research and technology.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. I can inform him that in 2001-02 GST revenues to the state of New South Wales will be $8,317 million, GST revenues to the state of Victoria will be $5,813 million and GST revenues to the state of Queensland will be $5,198 million. The moneys that the GST will raise for the state governments will pay for their education systems, will pay for police and will enable those states to run decent health services. But all of that would be at risk if you narrowed the indirect tax base, because narrowing the indirect tax base would mean less money for education, less money for health and less money for law and order. Of course, the one policy that the Labor Party have been defending in this parliament for the last 3½ years is the policy of roll-back. It is very hard to get them to say the word these days, so let us say it for them: roll-back; your policy for the last 3½ years. It is a policy which now dares not speak its name. Do you remember that, when Della Bosca said that they should give away roll-back, Della Bosca had his head chopped off? He walks headless through the streets of Sydney today as a testament to Labor's commitment to roll-back. Then, after Della Bosca got beheaded 13 months ago for saying, `Give up roll-back,' we had the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, if you please, sent out to deliver the same message last week. Then, after he delivered the message that roll-back was not important, the member for Hotham went out and said, `Oh, yes, it is; it's very important again.' Then we come into this parliament, and we have gone back the other way: we are off roll-back and now we are on health.The member for Dawson was moved to describe the Labor Party as `a cattle dog running around in the back of a ute' - run across to one side and yap, yap, yap; run across to the other side and yap, yap, yap. On this side it is `roll-back, roll-back, yap, yap, yap'; and on that side it is `health, health, yap, yap, yap'. - This is the old cattle dog of the Labor Party: to one side, then the next side, back and forward, round in circles and up and down.The other very interesting development in all of this is that, having now sort of changed tack again, we find that the person who has been absolutely debarked in this process is the member for Hotham. As we read in today's Financial Review, one of the Labor frontbenchers expressed concern that the leadership team, particularly opposition leader Mr Kim Beazley and shadow Treasurer Mr Simon Crean, had focused their attention on running a negative agenda against the coalition:`The less you see of Simon [Crean] whining about economics, the better,' one ALP frontbencher said.I say that there is one side of politics that loves to see Simon whining about economics - and this side of parliament stands foursquare behind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We do not want to see him sent off to Wimbledon, as he was during the Aston by-election. We want him out there, yap, yap, yapping in the back of the ute, because that is the way we love him. - </DOC>

 - The first claim made in the Leader of the Opposition's question is wrong. The claim that I have made is that the Australian health care agreements, which run until the year 2003, contain a real increase of 28 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition has quite deliberately misquoted what I said, as the Labor Party so frequently does. The reality is as set out in the chart that I tabled yesterday, and I will quote from the simple bar chart that I referred to in the previous answer. That chart discloses that in 1995-96, which for practical purposes was the last financial year of the Keating government, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care's total expenditure was $18 billion; in this current financial year, it is projected to be $29 billion - and that implies a significant increase.I make another more general point: the whole construct of what the Leader of the Opposition has been on about over the last two days, and what undoubtedly the Labor Party will be on about in the months ahead, is to try and create a sense of crisis in Australia's public hospital system. - There is. I thank the Leader of the Opposition. The problem when you run around falsely alleging that a crisis exists is that sometimes you have not whipped all your troops into line to say the same thing. I have in front of me the transcript of an interview of a leading Australian political figure who in recent months has been fairly successful - the Premier of Queensland. In the current affairs program Insight of Thursday, 16 August 2001, which is not all that long ago - we might be accused of living in the past in relation to -  -  - It is 16 August - yes, that is living in the past! I would encourage those who sit opposite to listen to this. I am sure that my colleagues will listen to it. Here are the authentic words of a Labor Premier in office saying something about the respective responsibilities of state and federal governments. He was talking about two subjects, health and education, and he said:You've got to remember the states run schools. The federal government has an education department, but it doesn't run schools, we do. When it comes to hospitals, I heard what Meg said, but the states run hospitals. We have the best public hospital system in Australia. We run it and we do a good job at running it. Sure, things can be improved like they can in any other area, but we run it.The reality is that out of the words -  - He's got me again! He said, `Thank you.' I'm in grave danger again. He's got me again; I acknowledge that. The Premier of Queensland was saying two very important things. He was saying that states are responsible for state schools and state hospitals, as they are. We provide very generous additional funding, and I have demonstrated very clearly over the last two days that the rate of increase of our funding for their responsibilities has been much greater than theirs. The Treasurer demonstrated that by what he said a moment ago about the goods and services tax: if you roll back the GST, you will roll back the capacity of the states to fund their own hospitals. That is what the Labor party is arguing for. We will take every opportunity of reminding the Australian public over the weeks ahead that it is the Labor Party that wants to take an axe to the funding base the states have for their hospitals and their schools. It is the Australian Labor Party that wants to take a broadaxe to the funding base. The GST, for the first time since a generation ago, has given the states of Australia access to a growth tax, which means that over the years they will have more money to spend on public hospitals, more money to spend on government schools, more money to spend on police, and more money to spend on other services that are needed by the Australian population.The other thing that Mr Beattie was doing inferentially was saying that the quality of public hospitals in Australia, particularly in the state of Queensland, was not too bad. Of course there can always be improvements in every area of government provision. Nobody in my position or in any other position of responsibility would ever assert otherwise. But if you look at the record, ours is that of a government that has steadily increased public expenditure in these areas. We have provided for further increases. We have watched the Australian state governments thieve money out of hospitals and schools over the years and devote it to their own political priorities and fantasies. On top of that, we have provided them with a growth tax, and the only party in this parliament that wants to cut that growth tax and thereby imperil the capacity of the states to fund those services is the Australian Labor Party through its policy of roll-back. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. The Private Health Insurance Administrative Council today released the figures for the private health sector for the June quarter. That is one very tangible way that our investment in health care has been helping the Australian health care system, and I would like to inform honourable members of it, as I will then inform of our contribution to the public health care sector as well, because we are committed to both.The PHIAC figures have some good news: the level of private health insurance has stabilised at around 8.7 million people. There is a very small drop that PHIAC attributes predominantly to population increase, if you are looking at percentage numbers, but if you are looking at global numbers we appear to have stabilised at around 8.7 million. Secondly, there are figures on gap cover, which is something on which we have worked enormously hard in the last couple of years. As at the June quarter, 71 per cent of all in-hospital episodes were covered by a gap cover scheme; that is, basically at no gap to the patient. When we came to government 5½ years ago, the figure was zero per cent; those schemes did not exist. Today, there is capacity for people to shop around and there is capacity for people not to have hidden, unknown expenses.The other thing that the PHIAC figures looked at was hospital separations; that is, private hospital admissions. For the June quarter 2001, the figure was up 17 per cent on the figure for the June 2000 quarter. That is at a time when there is fairly static public hospital separation, so clearly that is taking some pressure off the public hospital system, which was always one of our intentions but not the sole intention.The honourable member also asked about responsibility for the health care system. The Prime Minister has just very eloquently pointed out that the Queensland Premier has said that this is his area of responsibility, which it is, but of course we help. I note that the Leader of the Opposition is holding up a graph. I can say categorically that he is wrong with that graph. I have not seen it, but the first thing I would say is that the figures of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare are invariably about two years late. It always releases its figures behind time. I am happily prepared to release figures from my department which are accurate and up to date as of this financial year.The simple fact is that if you are looking at the proportion of hospitals covered by the Commonwealth and by the states -  - For all states in 1997-98 - and we use that year as the base year because that was the year immediately before the health care agreements and you should use it as the base because we could not have much influence over what was locked in in the previous five-year agreement under the Labor Party - if you look at all spending, excluding WA because we do not have their 2001-02 figures, which I think are to be released this week when the budget comes, the percentage of hospital costs met by the Commonwealth in 1997-98 was 40 per cent under the health care agreements. The percentage measured by the states was 60 per cent. Three years later, our share has gone from 40 per cent to 43 per cent -   - The states have gone from 60 per cent to 57 per cent. - Not only does he not have the call, he does not know what he is talking about and it is a very simple thing -  - I did do it through you, Mr Speaker. These figures that the Leader of the Opposition is quoting are selective and they are not something that anyone could have any confidence in. However, from a look at the figures, some states have done well. I have to admit that some states have done better than the Commonwealth and I am afraid that there are some states that have done worse than the Commonwealth. I have only just seen these figures - they are dated today - and, from the figures, the state that is doing quite well is South Australia. I will have to apologise to my friend Dean Brown for all the criticism I have given him over the years. In terms of the state share in South Australia, South Australia has been working hard on this and its own source funding has gone up from 59 per cent to 65 per cent. However, one state has done abysmally poorly. In 1997, that state was meeting 61 per cent of hospital costs; today it is meeting only 49 per cent of hospital costs and, at the same time, the Commonwealth's contribution to that state has gone from 39 per cent of costs to 51 per cent of costs. What state would that be? It is the Labor state of New South Wales. In fact, if you look at the last 12 months, not one single Labor state has matched the increase by the Commonwealth. The only state that has matched or increased it has been South Australia, and clearly it will benefit from that effort. The Labor Party try to pretend that there is some crisis here or some problem for the federal government, but, honestly, Australians are not going to fall for it. I table this document.</DOC>

 - Like all allegations from the other side of the House, I will check what the opposition spokesman has alleged here in the House. I assure the House that reservists are covered for medical treatment while they are on reserve duty; that is a longstanding policy. If he is really interested in the issue and in the welfare of our reservists, he will bring that issue directly to me. I would be happy to look at it. I am certainly disturbed at what he said has been going on. It will be corrected.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. I have seen reports that the Queensland Teachers Union has backed down -  - The Labor Party recognises the name of its friend. The Queensland Teachers Union has just backed down -  - It has backed down on its threats to ban literacy and numeracy testing in that state. This is a win for parents in Queensland. It is a win for all of those who want to ensure that Australian children have the basic literacy and numeracy skills they need.This literacy testing is part of the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan and a direct result of the initiatives of this government. Our aim under the national goals of schooling is that every child should be numerate and be able to read, write, spell and communicate by the time they leave primary school.It is important that we move on from the national standards and the national testing to the next step, which would seem very simple, I would think, to most members on this side of the House: to actually tell parents whether their children can read and write at the national standard. The only state where this is currently done is Western Australia, and that was introduced by the previous Liberal government in that state. Every Labor state government has opposed the provision of this information to parents. Indeed, here is a very interesting quote that one well-known Victorian parent made recently:Well, we certainly know that there are 13.8 per cent of year 5 students not reading at the national benchmark level for literacy in Victoria. Now, as a parent if my child was below that benchmark I would be asking my school, my teachers, how we work together to improve that.That is a very reasonable position from a concerned parent. The concerned parent in this case, however, was the Labor state education minister, Mary Delahunty, on ABC radio. The problem is that no parent in Victoria could do this because Mary Delahunty will not allow the schools to tell the parents whether their children are reading and writing at national standards.This is the utter hypocrisy of the Labor Party. It is a culture of secrecy that they have delivered to the Australian education system over the years. All the Labor state ministers deeply resent the efforts of this government to give parents the information that they need to do the right thing by their children. At the recent ministers' conference, the Labor ministers were urging the Commonwealth to back down on its insistence that in return for the Commonwealth money the Commonwealth requires every state to commit itself to teach every child to read and write properly. Make no mistake: a Beazley Labor government would cave in to this pressure.There was no commitment in `noodle nation' to national literacy standards; no commitment whatever to telling parents whether their children could read and write at the national standard level. All that we get from the Leader of the Opposition is this mealy-mouthed set of weasel words, that he supports basic skills tests. He ought to know - he does not know but he ought to know - that basic skills tests have never informed parents whether their children's level of literacy and numeracy is satisfactory and only the national standards introduced by the Howard government do this. And yet this is the only commitment we have from the Leader of the Opposition, the man who when he was education minister left 30 per cent of young Australians unable to read and write properly.If he were ever to return to government, we would see the opportunities for young Australians once again devastated because he does not have the ticker to stand up to the unions who are pressing him never to release this information and to keep it secret from parents. In doing so, he is quite prepared to disadvantage and sacrifice the educational future of young Australians.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member for Calare, I can confirm that, yes, I did meet representatives of the apple industry yesterday and have of course met them on a number of occasions over recent months to discuss issues of concern to that industry.Some months ago, the government commissioned a report on the industry: not just on the apple juice industry, I might add, but fundamentally on the future prospects for apple production in Australia. The report contains quite a lot of interesting information. I hope that the honourable member may read it in full, because his summary is not really an accurate reflection of everything that is contained in the report. It commends the industry for some of the advances that have been made over recent times but does also point out that there is still a lot more work to be done to make sure that the Australian apple industry is able to be competitive with other parts of the world.The report deals with the question of imports of apple juice from China and indeed a range of other countries - in fact, apple juice comes into this country from perhaps 10 or maybe even 20 countries, but imports from China certainly dominate those imports. The Americans have recently imposed antidumping duties on Chinese imports coming into that country, and that implies that at least into the USA there is a prima facie case that dumping has occurred from China. It does not necessarily follow, of course, that there are similar circumstances in Australia but there is obviously some evidence to support that view.I received the report a week or two ago. I have provided a copy of the report to my colleague the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, and asked him to examine the issues. Normally, it is a matter for an industry to lodge an antidumping case and that is the way in which virtually all antidumping cases are conducted in this country, and indeed others. The problem that the apple industry has is that the industry directly affected by the dumping is in fact the processing sector, and most of the processing sector in Australia are not interested in pursuing an antidumping case because they are using the imported product. It is difficult, therefore, to find a body or a group that is competent to make that application. That is the issue I have raised with my colleague Senator Ellison to see whether he may choose to use the powers that are available him as customs minister to launch an inquiry in that regard. I will continue to have discussions with him on those matters.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is no doubt that we are delivering on regional development and we are doing it in the most effective way possible, and that is by working in partnership with regions. We are not imposing solutions from on top. I was delighted to be in the member for Mallee's electorate just last week. Certainly there is some infrastructure we have managed to put in place there with local communities: $26 million for local roads, $15 million for the Wimmera-Mallee stock and domestic water supply system and $17 million for the Robinvale bridge. It is a pity, of course, that New South Wales will not come to the party and do their bit. They even want to knock a gift horse in the mouth. It is a very generous offer, and it is high time that Labor in New South Wales showed just a bit of commitment to the people who live west of the divide. The best way to illustrate what we are able to do, of course, is to refer to concrete examples. While I was in that part of the world I was able to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Victorian government, the Wodonga Rural City Council and Uncle Ben's of Australia - something that the member for Farrer and the member for Indi have worked very hard towards, in consultation with their local communities - for a $57 million Wodonga rail bypass. That will lead to a $45 million expansion by Uncle Ben's and another 60 jobs in that city. That is regional development happening. It will improve the amenities of the city as well: it will remove 11 level crossings from the Wodonga city area and it will free up quite an area in the city precinct for local development.At the same time, we signed a binding declaration that the Commonwealth funded external road bypass of Albury will become part of the national highway. That is a $330 million contribution in its own right towards the staging of a four-lane external, which is what the people of that community clearly want: certainty, a resolution, the heavy trucks out of the main part of the city. At the same time, we have put $70 million towards the upgrading of the internal relief route and the second river crossing. We have had Victoria join with us in partnership. We are still waiting for the Labor government in New South Wales - no interest in anyone west of the divide.But it is not just physical infrastructure that regional development is about; it is about the delivery of services as well. I would like to touch on regional health. We have got people here opposite who have become instant experts on delivering perfect health systems. But it is worth remembering that a third of Australians are regional Australians; they live outside the urban centres in this country. I think it is worth asking the question as to who it was that left that one-third of Australians, those seven million Australians, with an absolutely chronic shortage of doctors, specialists and nurses. Who was it who left a third of Australians with a chronic shortage of specialists, doctors and nurses? It was the Labor Party. And who is it who is fixing it? Who is it who has put in place the long-term planning to resolve the problem? Who was it who ran down the training of country kids in medicine and in medical disciplines to the point where there simply was not the supply over a very long period of time? Who was it? It was the Labor Party. The mess it left behind - and I choose this word carefully - was shambolic. - Shambolic. That is what it was. In fact, we got to the point where a town that I know well - it happens to be my own, and I do not think that is any reason why I should not use it - had a 2½-month waiting list to see a GP. -  - That is what you left us. More Doctors Better Services, which the Prime Minister has referred to, is a $700 million investment in delivering doctors, nurses, allied health workers, rural health service centres - a whole range of initiatives. Under that program, the Greater Murray area, which includes Albury-Wodonga -  - This is important. You ought to get this out, Mr Speaker.  - Albury-Wodonga has played host to almost 200 medical students and become home for eight new doctors, including three new specialists. That is the outcome of good policy, of good regional development. It is a direct result of the Liberal and National Party government establishing Australia's first totally rural clinical school in the area, the Greater Murray Clinical School, which has students in Wagga, Albury, Wodonga and Griffith. This is all on the ground, real and practical regional development. What do we hear from Labor? Very little. We do not know what the opposition spokesman thinks about the rail program in Wodonga, because he has not said anything about it. In a very rare policy prescription, we do know what he thinks about the bypass of Albury. He thinks that, after 20 years of not being able to make a decision, we ought to have another review - when we have finally made a decision we ought to have another review. That is all the Labor Party have got. We know that their whole policy in relation to infrastructure so far amounts to just one commitment: we will sit down and we will talk about it. That is as far as they have got.</DOC>

 - There are 2,056 Australians in public hospitals who have been identified as having had an ACAT assessment. That means that they have been assessed as being eligible to go into an aged care home some time in the next 12 months. That does not mean that those people should be automatically removed from the hospital and put into an aged care home forthwith; it means that they do require rehabilitation to bring them back to their optimum level of health to enable them either to go home or into the correct level of care. Under the health care agreements, which the Prime Minister has spoken about today, state public hospitals are funded to give rehabilitation to all patients and to have proper discharge policies within their hospitals. This is not happening. Indeed, I believe this money ought to be tied so that it does occur in future agreements. Despite the fact that there are 2,056 people - whom the Labor Party calls `bed blockers', which is a most disgraceful term that should be got rid of - those same state hospitals have 170,000 people waiting for elective surgery. - To try to blame people who have had an ACAT assessment and are awaiting proper restorative care is just a nonsense. I went to the AHMAC meeting of state health ministers only 10 days ago, and I put on the table an offer of 500 aged care places - that is, beds - worth $10 million, to be used by state governments if they put in matching funds for rehabilitation to allow these people to go into aged care homes or other settings and receive the rehabilitation that the state hospitals are already funded for under the health care agreements. - It is perfectly all right, Mr Speaker, because this lot do not understand how the system works and have no affinity for the truth at all. - To recap the point I was making: I offered 500 beds which could be used in a flexible manner, together with $10 million, to be matched by the state governments, to provide rehabilitation for these people so they could either go home or into the correct level of care. The South Australian government and the ACT government have agreed to accept part of this package. South Australia took 50 beds and is putting in $1½ million, and the ACT took 11 beds and is putting in matching funds. The Labor Party health ministers just wanted to play politics. But I am an even-handed person: I will leave the offer on the table. Already, I might say, officials from their departments are in discussion with my officials. This package of 500 beds has the capacity to deal with 2,000 people a year, which is about the number of people who have been identified as having had an ACAT assessment. The simple thing to understand in this issue is that older Australians are just as entitled to go to hospital as anybody else. They are entitled to be treated with respect, which is a word the Labor Party do not understand. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. Some of the agricultural commodities that are doing extremely well at the moment come from the electorate of Wannon. I am sure that his constituents are very pleased to see the end of the wool stockpile as a result of the policies of our government in recent years.It is important to note that in the last five years our exports grew by 52 per cent, from $93 billion to $142 billion last year. In the last financial year, they rose to $153 billion. Our agricultural industries and the automobile manufacturing industry in Australia have seen phenomenal growth in all sectors. The automotive industry this year has produced $4.65 billion worth of exports.This outstanding export performance has not happened just by chance. It is due to a lot of hard work by Australia's 22,000 exporting companies that do battle in the world marketplace, and they have been ably assisted by the good economic management provided by our government over that period of time. It has not been just by chance that our government has had the guts to implement the reform agenda and put our exporters in a much more competitive position globally. We have taken up the cudgels of reform and have delivered a merchandise trade surplus in 2000-01 of $1.3 billion - something we never saw under the Labor Party.During the time our exporters have been out in the marketplace creating new markets and we have been providing new opportunities in the marketplace, our government has developed a very sound economic environment in Australia. The OECD, in its latest economic survey on Australia, stated that during this time `Australian growth performance was remarkable'. And it has been driven by Australia's exports. Australia's exports have grown because of the policies our government has put in place over the last five or six years: fiscal consolidation, a focus on budget surpluses not budget deficits, a focus on taxation reform that has removed $3½ billion from the back of Australia's exporters, labour market reform - something the Labor Party never had the backbone to take on - and overall sound economic management. Those are the economic structures that have made our exporters far more competitive in the international marketplace, and the Australian Labor Party opposed every one of those reforms every step of the way. Apart from that, we have been actively pursuing an agenda and a policy setting of opening up markets across the world, both in our bilateral trade policy agenda and our multilateral trade policy agenda. We are actively negotiating a better circumstance in our bilateral relationships, and we are actively pursuing a multilateral agenda, particularly within the WTO. Just recently, we heard the Australian Labor Party in all its forms lecturing the government and Australia's exporters about the multilateral agenda, saying we should be doing more within the WTO and we should be putting more energy into ensuring that we launch a round of trade negotiations later this year. We are actively engaged in that. We have been actively engaged in a series of meetings and dialogues with my counterpart ministers within the WTO.  As recently as last week, numerous spokespersons from the Labor Party have been talking about what we should and should not be doing. We had the opposition spokesman, Senator Cook, talking about what we should be doing; and we had the great scribe, the member for Griffith, also talking about what we should and should not be doing - and the messages were not exactly the same message the Leader of the Opposition has been espousing on trade policy. There is a message from Senator Cook and from the member for Griffith, but the real challenge for the Leader of the Opposition is the message coming from the engine room of the Labor Party - and that is the union movement. The message about trade policy coming from the union movement is totally different from what we heard from the member for Hotham, from Senator Cook, and from the member for Griffith last week. They are all lecturing us about what we should be doing in the WTO. There is a web site called `November 13, Fair trade not free trade', and it is opposing exactly what the Labor Party are telling us we should be doing. Who are the sponsors of this organisation that is going to mount major protests this November when we are in Doha? If you have a look at the November 13 web site, you will see that it is sponsored by the ACTU, the CEPU, the AWU - and here he is: Dougie Cameron and the AMWU. There is a whole list from the union movement who are opposed to the free trade and market liberalisation that have provided all the market opportunities for our exporters to take advantage of. They are opposed to it. The challenge for the opposition is going to be to reconcile the views of the union movement that is bankrolling the Labor Party in the upcoming campaign - providing funding for the member for Paterson's campaign and for the candidates in Cowper, Page and Richmond. It is all coming from Doug Cameron's union. Which side of this argument is the Leader of the Opposition going to come down on? Is he going to come down on the side of Australia's exporters, who have fought hard to get where they are today and to get Australia's economy where it is today, or is he going to come down on the side of the union masters of the ALP?</DOC>

 - I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he is comparing apples and oranges - I absolutely guarantee it. This figure of 45 per cent in 1996-97 is completely fictitious.  -  - You are just comparing apples and oranges. Even a first year statistics student knows that, but the opposition cannot seem to get it into their heads.I am very happy for this government's health record at any time to be compared with that of the opposition's. I am very happy to have this five-year health care agreement compared with the previous five-year health care agreement. I am very happy for the Australian public to know that, under Kim Beazley as finance minister, there was a 17 per cent real increase over five years and that, under John Howard as Prime Minister, there has been a 28 per cent increase over five years. I am also happy for the Australian population to know that under Kim Beazley there was a fiddle where the extra money came off the financial assistance grants and the states were no better off; whereas, under John Howard, it was new additional funding, not something coming off the financial assistance grants. I am happy to have our record on health at any time compared. Labor talks about a crisis in health care. I will tell you what is a crisis. A crisis in health care is when you have 53 per cent of our kids properly immunised. A crisis in health care is when you are having epidemics of measles in the western suburbs of Sydney, as happened in 1993 and 1994. A crisis in health care is when you have 24 per cent of the population smoking, a figure which stuck for a decade, as you did under Labor, not 20.8 per cent, the lowest in the Western world, as you have with this government's four-year effort. A crisis in health care is when you have indigenous Australians not getting adequate services. We have not fixed it yet but, gee, we are trying, and the resources have more than doubled. A crisis in health care is when you have private health insurance in free fall and a government not prepared to do anything about it, as happened under Labor. Labor introduced Medicare and then rested on dewy-eyed self-congratulations for the next 13 years. The public will not fall for you again. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question, which certainly did bear repeating. This government's policy is jobs, jobs, jobs. This week we had a ringing endorsement of our policy from the most respected and authoritative independent judge. The OECD's economic survey of Australia said that the government's workplace relations reforms have produced `rising real wages, good productivity growth and rising profits.' In part thanks to the government's workplace reforms, Australia's structural rate of unemployment has dropped from about eight per cent to about six per cent in the past five years - and this matters because jobs are not just about money; jobs are about providing ordinary Australians with a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives. The OECD also said that we could do even better with further workplace relations reform. Unfortunately, one prospect is not for more reform but for a trip down memory lane under comrade Kim and his policy of full-scale industrial relations roll-back. - Labor's policy is to abolish Australian workplace agreements, even though they have meant higher pay for better work. Labor's policy is to abolish the Employment Advocate, even though the Employment Advocate is the protector of freedom of association and stands between Australian workers and the union heavies. The worst thing of all is that Labor's policy means a return to industry wide strikes of the type that once made Australia's industrial relations an international laughing stock. Just today, one of Australia's most respected and successful international businessmen passed his verdict on Labor's roll-back. Leigh Clifford, the boss of Rio Tinto, said: -  - Leigh Clifford's company employs thousands and thousands of Australians and contributes billions of dollars to Australia's GDP and hundred of millions of dollars to Australia's exports, and his views deserve to be listened to with respect by members opposite. He said: What we have got to do is look at what employee relations is about in the 21st century. It is not about what I would call cloth-cap socialism. The world has moved on.The world has moved on. The only people who have not moved on are the Jurassic Park dinosaurs who constitute the Australian Labor Party. The opposition is suffering from a bad case of industrial nostalgia. It is yearning for the good old days of the 1970s - the days of petrol queues, the days when there were public transport strikes every other week and the days of electricity blackouts because the union heavies were running amok. They are the days that would return if Kim Beazley were ever to become Prime Minister, because he is too weak to stand up to the union leaders who run the Labor Party. Let it be very clear: Labor means strikes and strikes cost jobs. - It is worth remembering that after the next election every living ex-ACTU president will be on the front bench of the federal Labor Party except for Bob Hawke, and I am sure Kim Beazley would like to find a job for him too.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I have not actually read that report, but I am aware of the argument that is being put by the Leader of the Opposition. I first of all remind him of what his mate Peter Beattie said: `Public hospitals are owned and run by state governments.' Our responsibility is to provide an adequate level of funding, which this government has done. This government has in fact increased -  - It has increased the funding that has been made available. I noticed that long, rambling news conference that the Leader of the Opposition had, that long, rambling sort of attempt to explain away the outrageous deception of your own caucus and the Australian public - but I will come to that in the moment. In that long, rambling news conference the Leader of the Opposition repeated this completely wrong, dishonest and disreputable claim that in some way, under the funding arrangements we have with the states, we are not paying as much money to the states under the various arrangements as was recommended by Ian Castles.The reality is that the Commonwealth is providing $31.6 billion over five years to the states. That is an increase in real terms of 28 per cent over the previous agreements. This amount includes indexation of around $650 million, which the Commonwealth agreed to on top of the default index rate written into the agreements. Once again, knowing the facts, you always twist them: give the Leader of the Opposition some known facts and he will always try and embellish them to try and make his own case look a bit better. Over and above that, our decision not to enforce provisions in the agreement associated with the rise in private health insurance participation and revenue associated with veterans has provided the states with the benefit of an additional $3 billion under the terms of the agreement. The reality is far from a short-changing of the states in relation to the Castles recommendations; the states will be over a net $2 billion better off than if we had fully implemented Castles and we had adjusted, as agreed, for private health insurance. Once again, the Leader of the Opposition is distorting the truth in trying to score cheap political points in the health debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his interest in this area. Obviously it is of major effect to his electorate. When we came to government 5½ years ago, rural health services really were in crisis. We had a long-term decline in the number of rural general practitioners. We had an increase in average age of rural general practitioners. We had very few country kids going into medical school. That is probably the most indictable figure. The best figure I can get is that in 1996 only eight per cent of the 1,200 kids in medical schools around Australia were from a rural or regional background, in spite of the fact that more than 25 per cent of kids are educated in rural and regional areas.It is not something that we waited long to act on, Mr Speaker. If you care to look at our 1996 election policy, we had significant initiatives in rural health, starting with a clinical school at Shepparton and a university department of rural health at Broken Hill. Our idea was to try and radically change the mould, to get medical education out of cities and into country areas and to get more country kids into med school, which over the long term will actually fix this problem, because a country kid has got a 45 per cent chance of going back to the country whereas a city kid has only got a five per cent chance of going to the country. After five years, we now have around one-quarter of all medical students in 2001 in first year in medical schools coming from a country background. We believe that figure is going to rise, so country kids will actually be overrepresented in medical schools by the positive steps we have taken. We have not had to introduce quotas, we have given incentives, and we have had an extraordinary turnaround.We have also had initiatives that have kept more doctors in country areas. Between 1997 and 2000, the headcount of country doctors went up seven per cent - a dramatic turnaround on the best part of 20 to 30 years of decline. The rural clinical schools and university departments have been so successful that they have been expanded to every university in the country, so every university will now have probably 10 to 15 per cent of their medical education outside capital cities. Country kids will be able to get a RAMA scholarship - $10,000 a year, not bonded, for a kid from a country background who comes in to do medical school, recognising that they have higher costs associated with living away from home. Our bonded places put an extra 100 kids into medical school last year, who now have a commitment to work in rural areas. Our GP training has been regionalised, with probably half of all general practice training now occurring in rural and regional areas. We have also implemented specific programs, such as the Rural Women's GP Program, because we recognise the fact that women in cities have a great range of doctors to choose from but in country areas there may be no such choice. We found that in Whyalla - in the member for Grey's electorate - which has a population of 26,000, there was no access to a female GP at all a couple of years ago. In Gunnedah in the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate, which has a population of 8,000 people, there was no access to a female GP. People now have access to female GPs through these initiatives. In this year's budget, we have further increased that. We have continued the Rural Retention Program, with 1,600 GPs being paid cash bonuses to stay in country areas. We work on the principle that the easiest doctor you are ever going to get is the one you have there already and we should keep the ones we have before trying to get new ones. There was $104 million to have practice nurses in rural areas to look at issues of public health and broader health issues because the GPs are so busy. There was $13 million for 100 new places for rural nurses to go and train nursing. This has been a dramatic turnaround and a lot of hard work, and it is bearing tangible, objective fruit in an area that was neglected for 30 years.</DOC>

 - I am not personally aware of that particular case. I therefore will make no comment on it in the absence of having the details. I would imagine that the administrative responsibility for those cases would be the same now as it was 10 years ago. I cannot imagine that 10 years ago, as a member of the Hawke or Keating governments, the Leader of the Opposition would have accepted the proposition that the Prime Minister of the day was personally responsible for every delay in a public hospital run by a state government. It is an absolutely absurd proposition. This represents the Himalayan heights of the opposition's alternative health policy. Peter Beattie, a somewhat more successful Labor leader than the Leader of the Opposition has been to date, said:You have to remember the states run the hospitals. We have the best public hospital system in Australia.That is a little bit of the boasting, a little bit of the puffery you naturally get from state premiers. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he has complaints about the running of state hospitals, he take it up with his state colleagues. I suggest that, if he has problems with the operation of state hospitals in Western Australia, he ought to take them up with Geoff Gallop. He also ought to, in the process, remind Dr Gallop that, under the arrangements that we have put in place, the public hospitals of Western Australia are going to share with the public hospitals of the other Australian states an increase of 28 per cent in real terms under the five-year period of the Australian health care agreements.I often hear the Leader of the Opposition talk about accountability and responsibility. I would not have thought he needed a first-year lecture in political science and the constitutional structure of the Australian federation but, under the federal system in Australia, there are some responsibilities given to federal government and there are some responsibilities given to state governments. We have responsibilities of a national character. We have an obligation to adequately fund to the extent of our capacity the operations of states. We do that. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he still opposes the introduction of a goods and services tax. He still remains opposed to a goods and services tax, but he is going to give to the states of Australia a greater capacity to fund their private hospitals in the years ahead. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that every time he rails against the GST he is railing against the capacity of the states of Australia to adequately fund their public hospitals and their government schools. You cannot have it both ways: you cannot claim to be the champion of public schools and public hospitals yet try to oppose the very revenue lifeline that will make it possible for states, years into the future, to more adequately fund their own constitutional responsibilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Western Australia is an area where in recent times we have put very substantial extra resources into the public hospital system. We do not have the latest figures on overall funding, because the Western Australian budget is yet to be brought down. I understand that is going to happen next month. In terms of the Commonwealth's own spending, this year the actual Commonwealth money paid over to Western Australia will go from $586 million to $644 million, an increase of $58 million, or about 10 per cent. That is an enormous additional increase in just one year, particularly when you consider it is a middle year of the health care agreements and that big increases like that were usually factored towards the first year of the health care agreements to get the states to sign up. So we are halfway through the health care agreement, and we are delivering an extra $58 million to the Western Australian government.I am aware of some comments about the functioning of the Western Australian health system made by the Western Australian health minister, Bob Kucera. He has been on radio recently, and I have heard him say two things. The first thing I have heard him say is:I am certainly embarrassed by anybody that has to put up with the difficulties we have within the health system.It is easy to understand why he is embarrassed, because in the West Australian on 14 August we have an article entitled `Health faces budget axe'. In what appears to be a very well sourced story, the reporter says, `The health department will have its finances slashed by 20 per cent in this year's budget.' So here we are, in the month before a budget, and we are having leaks to the West Australian newspaper. After the expenditure review committee in Western Australia has made its deliberations, the leaks start coming out: the Western Australian government is planning to slash funding to health by 20 per cent. That is at the same time as the Commonwealth is putting 10 per cent additional funds into health care. This is a new Labor government in office, and we have a well sourced leak that the health department is facing a 20 per cent cut in health care.Bob Kucera went on to make a very revealing statement - the sort of statement that is disarmingly frank and charmingly made during someone's early career in politics. He said:I make no apologies that we have got problems within the system. The problems are within the system. Six months in the job, and we are starting to forge forward, as I said. We are going to get over these pay claims, and I suspect that as soon as the pay claims are settled, the crisis will disappear. It is as simple as that. It has on every other occasion with these unions. Here we have a Western Australian state Labor minister blaming the unions for manufacturing a health crisis in his own state. I would not be so cynical as that about his unions, because Bob Kucera will find, as he has been in the job longer, that the unions probably have a legitimate claim for being under some pressure. The fact is that to have a Western Australian Labor health minister simply trying to blame the unions for his own pending 20 per cent cut in health care budgets when the Commonwealth budget has increased by 10 per cent shows you where the blame for this problem clearly lies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I am aware of certain allegations about treatment in accident and emergency - in fact, quite a large number of different and competing allegations about treatment in accident and emergency in Western Australia.This started yesterday when on AAP at 1.27 p.m. we had a story that came out of a briefing from the Labor caucus. The briefing was done by two people, George Campbell and Sue West. Both briefed independently. The story ran like this:Suffering from acute appendicitis about two months ago, Mr Beazley's middle daughter, Hannah, was taken to several public hospitals in Perth trying to get emergency admission. But the effort failed. There were no public beds available. Eventually the 22-year-old was admitted to a private hospital for treatment. A friend drove her from accident and emergency ward to A&amp;E, a caucus spokeswoman said. This story was still running on AAP at 7.12 p.m. the same night. No effort had been made to correct the story. The story at 7.12 p.m. read:Opposition leader Kim Beazley today blamed a funding shortfall for an incident where his daughter was denied emergency admission at several public hospitals. Mr Beazley told a meeting of Labor MPs and senators the incident happened about two months ago while his 22-year-old daughter was struck down with acute appendicitis. Attempts to get his daughter treated in public hospital failed because there were no spare beds.And then they drove around and around and around.We have a third independent confirmation of what was said at that caucus meeting, by the member for Jagajaga, who went on Sydney radio that afternoon and said: When Kim told us that story today in caucus, everybody gasped - I'll bet they did - because you really do not imagine that people will be turned away in an emergency.Here we have three people separately using the media to portray a picture of a person being turned away and denied emergency treatment in the case of acute appendicitis -  a story that was allowed to run without correction, a story that will was still running at 11 o'clock last night. - And in today's papers, naturally. We find this morning that we have had a media release from the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, something quite unusual. In fact, it comes after the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital said that they would not be commenting in detail. Let me read the Sir Charles Gairdner version of events, which has occurred after a review of the records that exist for this case:Mr Craig Bennett, Chief Executive of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, today confirmed the following points:Ms Hannah Beazley presented to the Emergency Department of Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital on the morning of Tuesday, 24 July 2001, with lower abdominal pain. She was correctly diagnosed as having appendicitis and given appropriate pain relief. Because the operating theatres at SCGH were busy, there would have been a slight delay in her surgery, as is often the case with appendicitis. On the day in question, an operating theatre was available at St John of God Hospital Subiaco more quickly than at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, but surgery could have been safely performed at SCGH had Ms Beazley preferred that.Opposition Members - When? - The opposition asks when. In the words of the CEO at Charles Gairdner, `After a slight delay.' The media release from Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital goes on to say:[Ms Beazley's election] to utilise her private insurance and have surgery at St John of God Hospital was primarily based on the availability of operating theatres. Senior clinical staff at SCGH have reviewed the records of her care and are of the firm view that her care and treatment at SCGH was both timely and appropriate.We had the opposition yesterday running a story until 11 o'clock last night in order to score a cheap political point off the government that someone had been turned away from an accident and emergency department and had been denied treatment; yet nothing could be further from the truth. It was a cold, calculated untruth told to the Australian people and repeated throughout the day by three independent sources. Having had overnight to try to get the story right, you would think that today the Leader of the Opposition might actually be able to get a consistent story. He appeared this morning on AM on ABC radio and he made this point to Linda Mottram:Not at all naïve. If you have the experience in your household of a person going to a public hospital, certainly having been looked at at that public hospital, but then having to go on to a private hospital for treatment ...That is not what Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital is saying as of lunchtime today. Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital is saying as of lunchtime today that there would have been a `slight delay in surgery, as is often the case with appendicitis.' They go on to say that Ms Beazley's surgery `could have been safely performed at Sir Charles Gairdner had she preferred it.' So even today the Leader of the Opposition has not got his story right. He is prepared to go on AM this morning and suggest that there was an absolute need to go to a private hospital when the public hospital itself in a Labor state says that that is complete bunkum. -  - Most of us in this place have kids, most of us know how distressing it is when our kids get sick and most of us know that we might even lose a bit of objectivity when our kids get sick, but most of us do not use our kids to make cheap political points.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition will be comforted to know that this line was run at the Premiers' Conference by, I think, Steve Bracks. He raised it without briefing, without argument, without substance and without material. I pointed out to him that the most recent analysis in relation to the state of Victoria indicated -  - from recollection, that the contribution being made to waiting lists in Victoria, and therefore the unavailability of beds in public hospitals through people waiting on a place in nursing homes, was something in the order of four per cent. I will check the precise statistic, but it is something in that order. In other words, the very substance of your question is totally and completely wrong. The truth of the matter is that public hospital waiting lists are the fault of state governments, whether they are Liberal governments or Labor governments, because the states have constitutional responsibility.  - Until the Leader of the Opposition can come up with a more convincing argument than that, all of the people on this side of the House are entitled - I think the phrase is - to turn away from the argument being put by the Leader of the Opposition</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is one further allegation, and it concerns how often these allegations have indeed been made. On AM this morning, in trying to defend taking a cheap political point over a fictitious and trumped up situation in the accident and emergency department, the Leader of the Opposition attempted to defend himself with the following words:Look, I'm not in the business here - and this is the first time I've said anything about this publicly. But he went on - he said more. He said:... let's get that absolutely clear. This is the first time I've said it.So we have the Leader of the Opposition in trouble on ABC radio this morning, under very substantial pressure for having gilded the situation and having said that his daughter was turned away from treatment when, in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. So what does the Leader of the Opposition do when he is under pressure for having fibbed the previous day? He says, `Look, I've never raised this before. Let me make that absolutely clear. I've never raised that before.' But he has a problem with that. That problem is what happened at Merimbula. A month before, in Merimbula, the Leader of the Opposition addressed a policy forum of 150 of his closest friends, and two people independently - one a local journalist, Donald Kerr - have come forward and said that they very clearly remember Mr Beazley making these allegations at that meeting.Opposition members - So what? - The opposition ask, `So what?' I will tell you so what: the Leader of the Opposition, when under pressure over having said something that was clearly not accurate, chose again to try to justify his situation by saying the first thing that came into his mind, which was, itself, clearly and demonstrably inaccurate. This is an issue of character. This is an issue that goes to the heart of the fitness of this man to even be the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that this man will lie and say anything that suits him to get himself out of trouble. Because of that, Mr Speaker, I seek leave to censure the Leader of the Opposition.  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. The government's policy and position in respect of privatisation have always been very much up front, very transparent and available for all Australians to see. Honourable members would be aware that prior to the 1996 election the government went to the Australian people and indicated quite clearly that it proposed to sell, when it got government, one-third of Telstra. Prior to the 1998 election, with respect to the further sale of Telstra, the government went to the Australian people and made abundantly clear what its position was regarding privatisation. When it comes to the sale of government businesses, the government has, broadly speaking, applied the Yellow Pages test, has undertaken feasibility studies and has recognised that, when it is in the interests of the Australian people, it is quite silly for the government to hold on to such businesses. That was the approach the government took with regard to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I can say that, when the Howard-led coalition government was given the responsibility of government in 1996, one of the first tasks that was placed in front of me as the Minister for Finance was to conclude the sale of 50.4 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. That particular sale had been set in train at an earlier point in time. But the sale of the final tranche, the 50.4 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, followed on from two previous tranches. I noted with great interest that in the prospectus entitled How to apply for shares in the Commonwealth Bank, there was a letter dated 24 September 1993 signed by the then Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, the predecessor of the current Leader of the Opposition. That letter was addressed to `Dear investor' and it went on to say:The government has no intentions whatsoever of further reducing its shareholding below 50.1 per cent in the Commonwealth Bank ...Further, that letter by the then Minister for Finance said:and the government looks forward to the Commonwealth of Australia continuing as the bank's majority shareholder in the future.So that was the pledge: the government would maintain its majority shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank. Eighteen months later, there was a budget delivered in May of 1995 - in fact, it was the last of those deficit budgets that this government had to confront when we got there in 1996. I noted that in Budget Paper No. 1, which had on the front `Circulated by the Hon. Ralph Willis and the Hon. Kim Beazley', the then Minister for Finance, there was this statement on page 3.214:Following the partial share sales conducted in 1991 and 1993 the government now intends to sell its remaining 50.4 per cent shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank.So here we go. The Leader of the Opposition has been running around the countryside in recent times and has had a series of people backing him up for months, and he has been saying, `I pledge this: I pledge never to sell any more of Telstra. The government will maintain the existing majority shareholding in Telstra.' And the signs go up: `Don't sell Telstra!' Of course, we know that the member for Melbourne and the member for Perth were in seeing the investment bankers last year, getting advice on what might be a way of disposing of Telstra's assets. So the man who in fact broke the pledge -  - Let me repeat it. The Macquarie Bank bulletin printed the fact that you were in there getting advice. That is what the bulletin said.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. There has been a good deal of debate about waiting times in accident and emergency over the last 24 hours and I think it is illustrative of how well our public hospitals can be working, even though I fully concede they are under pressure from time to time. This, of course, is not something unique to Australia; it is not unique to any state. Let us take the example and analyse it now that we have all the facts before us. A person turns up to casualty with abdominal pain at 11.03 in the morning. It is a busy day; the hospital is in full swing. What would normally then happen is that the person would be seen instantly by a nurse as they walked through the accident and emergency doors and they would be given a triage score. Undiagnosed abdominal pain would have a triage score of 3. That means that the person should be seen by a doctor in 30 minutes. That is an international standard, not something that we apply ourselves. The person would then go to the cubicles.In this case, did the doctor take 30 minutes to see the person with undiagnosed abdominal pain, as would have been an international standard? No. They were seen within five minutes by the doctor for the initial assessment. And, following that initial assessment, five minutes later - that is, 10 minutes after arriving in the hospital, still 20 minutes short of the international standard for the first visit by the doctor - the person was given a substantial dose of pain relief, so much so that the person became somewhat groggy. The hospital then arranged for a full surgical work-up, which required tests and required visits by a registrar and other doctors. That happened within 90 minutes. By any sense, that is a very good effort - a very good effort by international standards, a very good effort by Australian standards - for someone who just walks up to a hospital, unannounced. The question then is: what happens next? What happens next has actually shown a high degree of confusion, because there has been much said about there being no bed available. This in fact shows that one's thinking is somewhat out of date, because beds are not the rate limiting step in a case like this; operating theatres are. Ten years ago, hospital beds were actually the significant rate limiting step in a hospital. But, as length of stays have come down, throughputs have gone up. In most hospitals today it is the operating theatre availability that is the rate limiting step, not the bed. What in fact happens is people are discharged from hospital throughout the day. A hospital might find that more than 10 per cent of their beds turn over every day - beds may become available which you are not expecting - so there are always beds becoming available through a day.In this case it was not the availability of the bed that was a limiting step. I say that categorically. A bed would have become available. A bed was not an issue whatsoever. The simple issue was: how do we get someone into an operating theatre when we have a busy weekday with all the lists full? So the person then had the option of going to a private hospital, where it was believed there was a theatre available, or staying and having an operation on the same day in the public hospital. The person, at 2.38, decided to go to a private hospital to have the operation at 6.15 p.m. that night. That was a 3½-hour time from hitting the front door unannounced to being completely worked up and being discharged to somewhere where you can have your procedure. By any standards, that was actually a good effort as well.There is only one problem here with this whole story. The treatment was good. The hospital performed perfectly. How, then, can we possibly use this to create a crisis in our public hospital system? It is completely illogical. It has, however, created a crisis in the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition, because on this occasion he has been caught out, on the fourth occasion, gilding the lily. Yesterday in the House we watched him doing his Al Jolson routine: `Five hours, five hours, five hours.' There is only one problem. The Leader of the Opposition did not understand that hospital accident and emergency departments log everything precisely. And as he was up here at the dispatch box, waving and saying, `Five hours - it's outrageous!' the hospital was in fact doing the sums and finding that he had added 40 per cent to the length of time to make his argument stronger - just as he had said the previous day that someone had been turned away, when they had not; just as the previous day he had said he had never raised it before, when clearly he had; just as the previous day he had said the problem was that there was no bed available, which clearly was not the problem. The problem also for the Leader of the Opposition is that the previous day he had said she had had to go to the private hospital, when the public hospital says clearly she should have had treatment there. There is a very simple truism about health: you cannot fix health if you do not understand health. This shows very clearly that the Leader of the Opposition has no understanding of health whatsoever.</DOC>

 - As I already said in answer to the last question, when I am invited to address a meeting I do not set the admission, I do not collect the money; I do not inquire as to the tax arrangements; I do not fill in the return. That is the responsibility of anybody who is running the meeting. Nor am I told who is responsible for returning the tax arrangements, nor am I told who is going to do that. I am invited to give a speech, which I am very happy to do and which I do, and I do not inquire as to any of those arrangements.If the member for Hotham wants to make an allegation against any person that they have breached the law or otherwise, if he were genuinely interested he could give me evidence and I most certainly would refer it to the Australian Taxation Office. If the member for Hotham has any evidence whatsoever, he is very welcome to give it to me. I most certainly would refer it to the Australian Taxation Office. But the fact that he has not done so - he has never contacted me; he has never written to me - tells me that, like most of the allegations that he has made, most probably it is false and most probably it is done as a political stunt. But if he wants to give me any evidence whatsoever - whether he gives me evidence in relation to the Toowoomba Liberal Party or whether he gives me evidence in relation to the Hotham Labor Party - I am very happy to send it down.The only other thing I would say in response is: I am very pleased that he is now showing an interest in the enforcement of the GST, because I thought he wanted to roll it back. I actually thought that he never wanted it to be introduced. So on the one hand he says it should never have been introduced; once it is introduced, it should be rolled back. But if he can make a political stunt about its enforcement, he will do that as well. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Of course there was substantial talk on this yesterday, but the honourable member has asked me if I am aware of very recent statements on this issue, and we do have further information today on this issue. The whole question of the Leader of the Opposition's credibility turns on the issue of what was said in the caucus meeting. The Leader of the Opposition at a press conference yesterday, and in this House in a censure motion yesterday, made a great point of saying that he had not used the words that his daughter had been `turned away'.I was charitable; I was prepared to concede that one person's briefing could have got it wrong. Of course, unlike the coalition which actually have one person - the member for Menzies - do the briefings after our party room meetings, the Labor Party needs two: one from the Left and one from the Right. It is a little bit strange that both people yesterday got it wrong, and even stranger that the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister for health, went on radio and used the same phrase `turned away'. So three separate people having been at the one meeting all apparently had the same take from it. But, no, the Leader of the Opposition said, `To the best of my recollection, I haven't used those words.' I do not want to denigrate the profession of politics, but most of us know that, when someone uses a caveat like that, it actually means, `I don't think I can be found out.'In a doorstop this morning, the Leader of the Opposition was asked about this inconsistency. He was asked by a journalist:Jenny Macklin remembers you saying that she was `turned away' in caucus. BEAZLEY - If you take a look at what Jenny Macklin had to say, I think it was a little bit different from that.Let us have a look at what Jenny Macklin did say the day before. I will read a transcript from 2GB, Graham Richardson at 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon. I quote:MACKLIN - When Kim told us that story today in caucus, everyone gasped because you do not imagine that people will be turned away in an emergency.As far as I can see, the Leader of the Opposition's doorstop this morning, trying to suggest that it was a little bit different, is complete rubbish. It was in fact absolutely spot-on; it was absolutely dead identical. There is more because, over the last 24 hours, members of the press gallery have been phoning around and asking for independent confirmation of what went on in that caucus meeting. This can be very annoying for people in government because usually we are the beneficiaries or otherwise of this, but it can also be useful. Let me read what two journalists have written today about this supposed comment in caucus. Mark Mallabone from the West Australian said:Though the exact wording of his comments is unclear, some Labor MPs said they were told she was `turned away' from several public Perth hospitals before eventually finding a bed.Some Labor MPs, plural. Ian Henderson from the Australian wrote:Another Caucus source told The Australian yesterday that Mr Beazley's remarks to caucus had left the clear impression that his daughter `couldn't get a bed' at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and that she `was ferried around until they got her into a private hospital bed'.Here we have two different sources completely contradicting the Leader of the Opposition, backing up the three sources yesterday completely contradicting the Leader of the Opposition - a person whose credibility is in tatters.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I can inform him that when it comes to making election policy it is important that political parties do so from the basis of a clear and certain budget position and do so in the knowledge that the undertakings that they give to the Australian public can be implemented consistent with good economic policy.All of us in this House would remember the shameful 1993 election when the Labor Party ran to that election with a policy of opposing a GST and introducing income tax cuts; in fact, not just introducing tax cuts -  they said before the election that those tax cuts were `l-a-w'. Then, after they were elected, we found out that the Labor Party hiked every wholesale sales tax, took away the income tax cuts, increased the company tax and increased petrol excise by some five cents. The Leader of the Opposition boasted that they had been able to get away with such a program. Don't you recall him coming into this House and boasting that the opposition had been unable to nail him during that 1993 election in relation to his policy? Let us flick forward to the 1996 election. The 1996 election was fought at a time when the now Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Finance. Who will ever forget the words that he uttered on 1 February 1996? Remember, this was the financial year ending on 30 June that year. He said this: `We are operating in surplus and our projections are for surpluses in the future.' That next month, after this government was elected, when the Treasury came in, there was no surplus. The budget was then, at the time the Leader of the Opposition made those remarks, some $8 billion in deficit. What happened when he was confronted with the truth? Was there an acknowledgment that he had misrepresented the situation? Was there an acknowledgment that he should not have been claiming during that election campaign that the budget was in surplus when it was not? No. In a pattern of behaviour he sought then to cover up the situation. On 17 April 1996, after the independent books had been thrown open by the Treasury, he said this:... this notion of an $8 billion hole is largely a fraud ... there are no statistics produced by Treasury that indicated there was that dimension of a hole ...So there is a pattern of behaviour. First of all, they say during the election campaign that the budget is in surplus. When they lose the election and the Treasury produces the figures, there is a denial of the facts. It was a denial that the then shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, did not seek to continue. As I informed the House last week, even the then shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, had the decency to acknowledge Labor's failure. He had the decency to put out a press release; he had the decency to say, and I tabled it in the House, that he had never disputed that the budget was in deficit in that 1995-96 year. He said it was no secret that he did not dispute it. His line was, `Yes, it was in deficit; yes, we had misrepresented the situation, but we did intend to try and fix it.'But that is different to the Leader of the Opposition. To my knowledge, the Leader of the Opposition has never yet admitted the falsity of what he said during the 1996 election campaign. To my knowledge, he has yet to acknowledge the falsity of the way in which he made allegations against the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Western Australia. - There were no allegations against them? There were no allegations against the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital? This was heard by the two caucus spokesmen, it was repeated on the radio by your health spokesman, it ran all through the afternoon that your daughter had been turned away and it ran in the papers the next day. He makes no allegations against the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital; he makes no allegations against the Western Australian government, which happens to run the hospital; he does not make any allegations against Premier Geoff Gallop, who happens to be one of his best friends. No, he crosses the continent to make allegations against the federal Liberal government and the Prime Minister. - That is right, he says. Why? Because what you were interested in throughout this was the political stunt and you were prepared to misrepresent the facts in order to get it. The defence that the Labor Party now engages in today is, `Look how successful we've been. By bringing in the daughter of the Leader of the Opposition, by making a false allegation, by turning it into a political attack, look how successful we've been.' It is boasting that by misrepresenting the facts you have been able to achieve some political stunt.It would be much more credible if the Leader of the Opposition was able to face the facts and if he was able to say that the description he gave to the caucus was false, his cheap political attack on the Prime Minister, the minister for health and the Federal government was false; that he was prepared to politicise the treatment of his daughter for a political stunt; that his position in the 1996 election was false; and that his denial and cover-up afterwards was false. This is a pattern of behaviour which first misrepresents and then seeks to cover up rather than to deal with the facts. These are not the attributes of somebody who can produce a policy and they are not the attributes of someone who would become Prime Minister of this country. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. It is of course appropriate that we review our efforts on cancer, given that tomorrow is Daffodil Day, the Australian Cancer Council's major fundraising effort, and I commend many people on both sides of the House who have worn a daffodil today - it certainly brightens the place up a bit.There is probably no-one in the House today who is not touched by cancer one way or another, either through themselves or through a loved one. Cancer has often been called the affliction of the 20th century, although, to be fair, if you actually break cancer up, you find that the great increase in cancer over the 20th century was caused by lung cancer. Nonetheless, a whole range of other cancers are very terrifying to most people. Soon after I became minister, I elevated cancer to a national health priority area, which meant that the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments had to work together in attempting to coordinate these services. This is no easy thing, but it is having some quite substantial success. In 1997, we sponsored the establishment of the national cancer control initiative to look at some specific activities where there were gaps in cancer. This is being auspiced by the Australian Cancer Society and it is doing an excellent job. We have also continued support of the National Breast Cancer Centre that was originally conceived under the previous government. The member for Fremantle funded it initially and it has proved to be entirely successful. I was initially sceptical about disease specific initiatives, but this has been one disease specific initiative that has really worked. Australia has one of the best outcomes for cancer of any country in the world, and that is something Australians can be proud of. We are salvaging more life from cancer. With regard to the two areas of cancer that affect women particularly, breast cancer and cervical cancer, just in the last five years alone deaths from cervical cancer are down approximately 13 per cent and deaths from breast cancer are down 17 per cent. We have augmented these activities with additional funding in this year's budget to try and make our cervical cancer screening work better. Currently, 65 per cent of women in Australia are appropriately screened - that is, once every two years. Around 35 per cent are underscreened or never screened. The women who are underscreened or never screened tend to be older women. Of women born in Australia, New Zealand or the UK, 600,000 have never been screened whereas, of women born in non-English-speaking countries, 300,000 have never been screened. It is a misnomer to think that the hard-to-get women are necessarily Aboriginal women, rural women or women from non-English-speaking backgrounds, because the biggest cohort of women who have never been screened is older women born in Australia, New Zealand or the UK. For that reason, I was able to persuade my colleagues to put $72 million in this year's budget for a very substantial initiative into cervical cancer.The basis for doing that was our success with immunisation. Immunisation has been something that the government has turned around and we used the system that was already there - one of general practice and by paying general practitioners incentives. This is the first time that GPs have been paid for outcomes. Last year, over 5,500 general practices were involved in the immunisation incentive program. We had 86 per cent of all general practices in Australia having more than 80 per cent of their kids properly immunised, and 48.6 per cent of general practices in Australia had 90 per cent of their kids properly immunised. That was an absolutely dramatic turnaround in a five-year period by putting the incentives where people go.The point about general practice, as I said the other day, is that 91 per cent of women go to a GP every year. That is a very high figure. Nearly 97 per cent of all women will go to a GP every two years, and every two years is the screening period for cervical cancer. Only three per cent of women in Australia will not go to a GP in a two-year period. With 35 per cent of women unscreened or underscreened, we can get to probably 32 of those 35 using the existing network we have. There is only about three per cent of those 35 that we are going to have real difficulty getting to other than through the GPs themselves. That is why we are so strongly opposed to alternative programs that would take that away. In the end, general practice has been shown to be an effective way to do it. Setting up a bureaucracy for a limited amount of money in a limited number of places is not going to meet the needs of those 600,000 European women and 300,000 NESB women who are being underscreened. We have had, as I have said, an extraordinary reduction in cervical cancer - 40 per cent in the last five years - but we can do substantially better if we use what works and ignore what does not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question and for her concern about consumer protection. The financial services industry in Australia represents seven per cent of our economy and it employs 330,000 people. Today, the Senate passed landmark legislation that will deliver for Australian consumers new regulation that will in turn deliver better financial products and better financial services. The Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 removes cumbersome licensing, conduct and disclosure laws. It removes the requirement for a financial service provider to smother consumers in paperwork that is often too legalistic and too technical. It means that banks, building societies, credit unions, insurance companies and fund managers can offer products that better respond to the individual consumer's needs. It also means that lawyers, accountants, financial planners, insurance advisers and all financial institution employees need to think carefully about consumer needs before they sell to them or advise them on financial products. The new regime is particularly innovative because it means that the same laws and the same rules will apply to most financial products whether they are sold to consumers via the Internet, via the phone, face to face or through an agent. That is a clear illustration of the government's commitment to good regulation, not more regulation. Underpinning this major reform are a few key principles. Firstly, the laws that we have introduced are based on honesty. They are based on the concept that people in important positions must tell the truth to the general public. Secondly, the laws are based on credibility. Before they ask people for their money, providers must have a proven track record of doing the right thing by the public. Thirdly, the laws are based on integrity. It is no use being in a position of power if the public are unsure of your credentials for the job. Finally, the laws are based on accountability. If you mislead the public on important matters, you are held accountable for your actions, for what you have said and, importantly, for what you did not say. It might surprise some people that we were able to get that bill through the Senate, but it happened after much cajoling and a little pushing. However, when it came to the crunch today, on an important matter relating to the protection of the public, the Labor Party went to water. That is perhaps no surprise, after what we have seen this week. We were concerned that, during a takeover, everyday investors - the mums and dads of Australia, who have made us the largest share owning nation in the world - may be misled by stockbrokers into selling their shares for the first time. Many investors would know that, when they ring up their stockbroker, the stockbroker usually tapes the conversation. That is designed to protect the stockbroker if the public make commitments and then do not keep them. The Howard government wanted to offer the same protection to Australian consumers. That is, if a stockbroker rings a consumer and asks them to sell their shares during a takeover, we want to make sure that the stockbroker is telling the truth. The way to do that is to tape conversations in the same way that the stockbroker is protected. The Labor Party, in that instance, decided to back the big end of town. The Labor Party was more interested in protecting stockbrokers than in protecting consumers. It was not a great leap. We were not asking the Labor Party to support the taping of caucus. We were not asking the Labor Party to support the taping of a public meeting in Merimbula. We were asking them to support the protection of consumers when it really matters -  when they are being asked to part with their money. It comes down to credibility. When the acid test is applied to the Labor Party, they are shown to be short of credibility. When the acid test is placed on the government, we are credible, we are honest, and we are about protecting all Australians. </DOC>

 - I have had no discussion with the Minister for Small Business about any scam involving the Groom electorate or any other electorate - none whatsoever. As I said earlier in relation to the first question on this matter, if I attend a meeting of an electorate committee, I go and I give a speech. I am not responsible for selling the food or the service. I am not responsible for the charge, nor am I responsible for remitting in relation to the Australian Taxation Office. That is not my responsibility. It is the responsibility under the law of those people or those persons that are selling the goods or the services, not the person who makes the speech, as I said in my answer to the first question. If the Groom FEC or the Hotham ALP or anybody else wanted to know what their taxation liabilities were, my advice to them would always be the same: they should pay their taxation liabilities. If the member for Hotham or anybody else wants to say that they have not paid their taxation liabilities, they can give evidence, which I would pass across to the Australian Taxation Office. As I said in answer to the first question, if you want to give evidence that they have not done it, then you can pass it across. I would be only too happy to pass it across. But, if the Groom FEC want any advice from me, my advice to them would be to pay their due and just taxation liabilities. That would certainly be my advice to them if they sought it. I would give the same advice in relation to the Hotham ALP, I would give it in relation to a small business, and I would give it in relation to any other organisation. That would be my advice. That is the position I have always adopted, and that is the position in relation to these questions.  </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I am pleased to advise the House that the government has made commitments in respect of defence and we are sticking to those commitments. Furthermore, in this year's budget we provided hundreds of millions of dollars to make those commitments a reality for a more efficient, more modern and up-to-date Defence Force. In fact, we have plans to spend in the order of  $27 billion over 10 years. We have given the defence organisation a plan for the future and the resources and commitment to make that a reality. I am asked about other commitments in defence and the credibility of those commitments. The opposition certainly have commitments in the area of defence, but they have absolutely no credibility when it comes to sustaining those commitments. In fact, I would say to the parliament that most of the commitments made by the Labor Party are commitments which, in effect, will deceive the Australian people as to what the Labor Party can or cannot do in the future in regard to defence.  - We have from the Leader of the Opposition constant carping that he is going to set up a coastguard, yet he himself, when he was a relevant minister, brought down a report saying that it would be ineffective and would in fact cost us a lot of money. It is a deception of the Australian people for him to put forward the idea of a coastguard. It would not work. It would reduce the effectiveness of the existing operation and, of course, the opposition does not have the money to pay for it. That is not the only thing for which the Labor Party do not have the money but which they are out in the Australian community touting they would do if they were elected. They are promising people in the Hunter a new bombing range at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.   - There is one promise after another, none of which will ever be backed up and for which there is not one cent to make them a reality. There were promises of Anzac battalions and a couple of additional submarines - just to mention some - which would cost literally billions of dollars and which the Labor Party know will never be delivered. Yet they are still out there in the public arena advocating these propositions. Now we see that the Leader of the Opposition says that he is not going to increase the Defence budget. But of course he has got all the promises out there - to one group here and one group there. There is one offer after another. He has got a promise for anybody who is prepared to listen, just on the basis that none of the comments go national. These promises have no credibility. I am asked whether or not we have seen such promises in the past. Of course we have. I take just one example, of which there are many: when the Leader of the Opposition was defence minister, he went down to Newcastle in 1989 to tell them that five of the 12 ships - the frigates to be built - would be assembled and launched in Newcastle. As everybody knows, that was not true. It never happened. It is typical of what those opposite do - promising a group here, promising a group there. They are promises that will never be kept. In the last 24 hours we have had a few emails coming in on this subject as well. There was a talkback caller named Michael on 3AW this morning who I thought spoke on behalf of many Australians when he said:When Kim Beazley was defence minister, he came to Williamstown dockyards. He said `Go out and mortgage your house, go out and buy a new car, your jobs are safe.' About seven months later, a couple of hundred or nearly a thousand people lost their jobs.He then said:A leopard never changes his spots.The Labor Party has no credibility whatsoever on defence. It is a fabrication and a deception to be advocating proposals across the country that the Labor Party will never put one cent towards if ever they get into government and for which they have no commitment whatsoever.</DOC>

 - As I said in the answer to my first question, if I attend the Groom FEC dinner -  - As I said, if I attend a dinner of the Groom FEC, or indeed any meeting of the Queensland Liberal Party or any other Liberal Party - or whether I attend a meeting of the Rotary Club or whether I attend an Olympic dinner - and it is my responsibility to give a speech, I will turn up and I will give the speech. It is the responsibility of the person who is selling the goods and the services to comply with their taxation obligations. I do not ask them what their taxation obligations are. I do not advise them on their taxation obligations. If they seek my advice, my advice to them is to comply with their taxation obligations. I would say to the Groom FEC or the Queensland Liberal Party - or, indeed, to the Hotham ALP if they want to invite me out to give a speech -  that they should comply with their obligations and that they should make full disclosure in relation to all of their obligations to the Australian Taxation Office. After making full disclosure of all of their obligations to the Australian Taxation Office, they should pay any liability that they have. That is my view and that is what I advise them.As I understand it - and I am having this checked during question time - the Australian Taxation Office has done an audit on the Queensland Liberal Party in relation to its obligations. I will find out from the commissioner whether or not the audit has uncovered any material that shows that obligations have not been adhered to. If it has, our advice to the Queensland division of the Liberal Party is that they should comply with their obligations, just like anybody else. The Australian Taxation Office would be instructed if it sought advice, which it probably would not, from the government that the law should be enforced in relation to the Queensland Liberal Party, just as it should be enforced in relation to the Victorian Labor Party. My recollection is that the Victorian Labor Party at one point was caught not complying with its obligations in relation to a fundraising dinner. -  - That is my certain recollection. I believe that, when we were approached in relation to the Victorian Labor Party not complying with its obligation, our position was the same: the Victorian Labor Party should comply with its obligation. It should go down to the Australian Taxation Office, it should make a clean breast of its position and it should pay its liability. The attitude we take in relation to the Victorian Labor Party is precisely the attitude we take in relation to the Queensland Liberal Party: if there is anybody in Queensland who has not complied with their obligation they should go down to the Australian Taxation Office, they should make complete disclosure and they should pay their obligation. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has evidence that they have not done that, I am more than happy to pass it across to the tax commissioner, who is responsible for enforcing the law, and I am more than happy to ensure that the law is enforced.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. Yes, I have seen recent media reports on education policy. The Daily Telegraph this morning decided to address the issue of education policy under the headline `Keystone Kim -  Beazley leaves trail of blunders as election nears'. The article addressed the issue of Knowledge Nation - noodle nation. Do you remember noodle nation, Mr Acting Speaker, and what the Leader of the Opposition said on 2 July, when he released Knowledge Nation, the education policy that dare not speak its name? He said: I commit the Australian Labor Party from today to the long-term agenda of this Report, and I pledge all my energies and my every working day to achieving it ... He pledged that, every working day, he would be pursuing Knowledge Nation. Yet, less than a month later, on 1 August, he said on Adelaide radio of this grand scheme:If it hadn't been for that little design of Barry's, it would have been talked about for one day and disappeared.He was making fun of his own policy. Within a month he was saying that this was a purely opportunistic document. He knew it had no real credibility, and he was making light of it. The only publicity it got was the spaghetti-and-meatballs diagram of Barry Jones. That is how much belief he had in his policy. - Since this parliament has returned, there has not been a single reference by the Leader of the Opposition to this policy that he said he would dedicate to promoting every working day. This is the education policy that dare not speak its name. The tax policy has disappeared, roll-back has disappeared, the education policy has disappeared and now his credibility on health has gone down the drain. All we see from the Leader of the Opposition is an utterly cynical attempt to beat up policies when he thinks he can get a bit of credit or kudos on the day for what he says and then in the end abandon them because he has no real interest in the substance whatsoever. You cannot believe a word that he says.We are reminded of the words of the member for Werriwa to the Sydney Morning Herald in October 1998. When the education policy was abandoned and he resigned as the education shadow minister, the member for Werriwa said:... people think Kim's a big angel, but some of this stuff is a bit dirty behind the scenes.What cynical opportunism that revealed about the Leader of the Opposition. Nobody thinks he is a big angel any more; in fact, nobody believes him anymore. Nobody believes him because he has no credibility. His attitude to policy is utterly opportunistic and he will say anything to try to win a point on the day whether or not that point is true and whether or not he has any commitment to the policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. This government said that it was going to deliver better lives to ordinary Australians, and it certainly has. This government has produced more jobs. People are earning higher pay and they are paying lower tax. This government has delivered on its promises. The only alternative policy is a document entitled Knowledge Nation, which has been described as `long on rhetoric, short on detail and blank on costing'. That is not my description. That is the description of Knowledge Nation by someone who knows the Leader of the Opposition well: former Senator Peter Walsh who, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, was a minister who actually got things done in government. If you look at this extraordinary spaghetti-and-meatballs diagram which is supposed to encapsulate Knowledge Nation, there is one truly remarkable omission. The one remarkable omission from this diagram is jobs. I have the missing meatball. I recommend to the Leader of the Opposition that any policy worthy of the name must have jobs as its centrepiece.The nearest thing to an employment program in knowledge nation is in recommendation 13, which talks about `ensuring that employers increase their level of investment in training'. So what we have is another trip down memory lane with Keystone Kim, or in the case of the Leader of the Opposition it is recovered memory lane -  - or false memory lane. He wants to go back to the training guarantee levy of the Keating government, which did not stop apprenticeships falling to record low numbers and did not stop Australia developing the best trained dole queues in the world. There is a fundamental contradiction at the heart of Knowledge Nation. This Leader of the Opposition expects these switched-on, wired-up, online workers to operate under a 1970s style industrial relations system. He expects these young, dynamic entrepreneurs to leave their high-tech laboratories, get into their P76s and their Trabants, go down to the Industrial Relations Commission and ask for directions about everything that happens in their workplace. He expects these people, who can out-compete the world, to become industrial zombies and to put their hands up every time the union officials say so.There is a very simple reason why there is no reference to decent, dynamic workplace relations in knowledge nation. When you actually look at the people who made submissions to knowledge nation, you see that there were 10 academic organisations, one academic trade union and, of course, who else but the AMWU - our old friends the AMWU who bankroll the Labor Party and determine its policy. I doubt very much whether Dougie Cameron actually wrote Knowledge Nation, because only someone as prolix as the Leader of the Opposition could write a 55-page wish list. Knowledge Nation entirely symbolises the character of the Leader of the Opposition: embellish the bad news, fib about the facts and bluster when you get caught out. Knowledge Nation is a fairytale - every bit as much a fairytale as Kim's hospital tales.</DOC>

 - It is open to the parliament to question and scrutinise the conduct of any minister; that is the role of parliament. I want to make it clear that my referring this matter to the tax office was not designed in any way to prevent questions being asked of me, questions being asked of the Minister for Small Business or questions being asked of the Treasurer. I want to assure the Leader of the Opposition that in no way is this some device to close down discussion on this issue; rather it is an earnest of our desire to get to the bottom of this matter if there is anything untoward. It is our belief that the audit is a very good thing. It is our belief that the audit will enable the tax office to examine all of the activities of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party since the commencement of the GST legislation on 1 July.  I take the view that branches of all political parties must comply with the GST legislation, and I would invite the Leader of the Opposition to allow an audit of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: why don't you put Bracks in the dock? Why don't you allow a tax audit? Bear in mind that this question was asked of me by a man who last week deliberately misled the Australian people about the hospital system in Western Australia. This is a man who is up on his hind legs attacking the reputation of my minister, when he himself quite deliberately and shamelessly misled the Australian people last week.The tax audit has been requested by me as an earnest of my willingness to have every aspect of the GST tax affairs of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party examined. I have nothing to hide. The division tells me it has nothing to hide. The tax audit will be conducted. - I have called the audit. They can interject as much as they like. We have called the audit. He refuses to have an audit of Bracks. - No wonder, indeed, as the Treasurer interjects. If you are really so interested in transparency, why don't you have an audit of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party? May I make one other point, Mr Speaker? I was asked yesterday, by one of the media outlets through my press secretary, whether I would make the results of the audit by the tax office available. My response was that that would be a matter for the tax office and the Queensland branch. -  - Don't get too excited: I know you think you are on the verge of something big here, but I would not get too excited. I want to make it clear - and I have made this perfectly clear to the Queensland branch - that I think the results of the audit should be made public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for the question. I think all members of the House will be aware of news reports indicating that a Norwegian vessel, the Tampa, which is a fairly large container vessel, took on board several hundred people from a vessel which had foundered in what I am told was the Indonesian search and rescue area of responsibility in area defined by international law as `the high seas'. Those souls were taken on board by the Norwegian vessel. The Norwegian vessel then intended, as I understand, to set sail for the nearest point of possible disembarkation, which was an Indonesian port by the name of Merak. I am also informed that preliminary arrangements had been made by the Indonesian authorities to receive these people on their disembarkation from the Norwegian vessel at Merak. Subsequently, so media reports indicate, and as testified to on the radio this morning by the captain of the Norwegian vessel, under duress from some of the people picked up, the captain changed his plans and an indication was evinced to sail to Australian waters. We have communicated with the captain, and we have also communicated with the Indonesian and Norwegian governments. We have indicated to the captain that permission to land in Australia will not be granted to this vessel. We believe that there are special circumstances in this case, particularly the background that I have described, that justify the action taken by the government. We have told the Norwegian government and the Indonesian government that this is a matter to be resolved between the government of Indonesia and the government of Norway. It is, so I am told, a matter of international law that the ship's master had an obligation, given the circumstances of the rescue of the people involved, to head for the nearest point of possible disembarkation, and that was an Indonesian port. We have indicated to the ship's captain - and we have also indicated this to the Norwegian authorities and to the Indonesian government - that Australia stands ready to provide any humanitarian assistance that may be required on the vessel, including the landing of food and medical supplies and the provision of a doctor or doctors or paramedics, if that is necessary. We have also indicated to the government of Indonesia that we would be prepared to make available financial assistance, either through an international agency or directly, to the government of Indonesia to assist the Indonesians in relation to the reception and processing of and caring for the people who have been taken on board the motor vessel Tampa.This is a very difficult and sad situation. From the very beginning, Australia has sought on all occasions - particularly under the administration of my current minister, who I think has done an outstanding job in an incredibly difficult situation - to balance against the undoubted right of this country to decide who comes here and in what circumstances, a right that any other sovereign nation has, our humanitarian obligations as a warm-hearted, decent international citizen.Australia has a record in relation to caring for refugees of which every member of this House should be proud. No nation in the last 50 years has been more generous or more decent in relation to refugees than has Australia. Of all of the debate that has gone on about this issue, nothing I think grieves people on this side of the House more than the allegation that in some way we have been insensitive to people who are seeking to be classified as refugees. But that does not mean that we are abandoning in any way our right to decide who comes here; nor shall we ever abandon our right to refuse to allow people to be landed in this country in circumstances where that would not represent the best so far as Australia's national interest is concerned. We have taken this decision based on a proper understanding of our rights under international law. It is the right decision to take in Australia's national interest. I hope that, amongst other things, it sends a message to people smugglers and others around the world that, whilst this is a humanitarian, decent country, we are not a soft touch and we are not a nation whose sovereign rights in relation to who comes here are going to be trampled on.</DOC>

I express the hope that the opposition will now withdraw its objections to legislation in the Senate so that we can send yet a further signal - a very clear signal - to those who would seek to trample on our sovereign right in this area that that is not acceptable to either side of Australian politics.In relation to the function, I do remember that function. It was a magnificent celebration of five years of coalition government. Of course I do not know the arrangements but, Mr Speaker, I will tell you what I will do: I will do a deal. -  - I will do a deal with the Leader of the Opposition.

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, and note her continuing interest in these matters. I will quietly outline the issues that we are dealing with and some of the reasons for the movement that we are seeing and, in the spirit of cooperation that has already been offered by the Leader of the Opposition, point to the measures that could have an impact on the nature of the arrivals that we are experiencing. I foreshadowed quite clearly that the continuing phenomena of unauthorised arrivals by boat was something that we would see for some time. There are large numbers of people who have moved into Indonesia in expectation that they will be smuggled into Australia, and in expectation that when they get here they will get certain outcomes. The fact is that the relative attractiveness of Australia over other countries where people can be safe and secure is very much affected by the nature of the decisions that are taken in relation to them. I would like to point out to my friend the honourable member for Bowman why that is the case.I have already made known that there are quite significant differences in the outcome when decisions are taken by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on asylum claims in Indonesia and the outcome that is achieved in Australia if they happen to get here. For Afghanis - and bear in mind they may or may not be Afghanis; we have evidence to suggest that a significant proportion may be Pakistanis or in fact have residency rights in Pakistan and other countries - 84 per cent get their claims up here in Australia. Why the difference? There are two reasons for the difference. One is that in Australia over a period of time the law has been the subject of development by judicial decision making. I saw some comments by the honourable member for Bowman which said on a radio station in South Australia today:... but I've got to say to you that 75% of every one that can find their way onto our shore on a boat are given refugee status - 75%. So there's no question of appeals for them.That is so. Their cases are dealt with by the tribunal that has to apply the law that has already been determined by the Australian courts and has constrained the way in which it can make its decisions. That is the nature of the jurisprudential model. - The law develops here in a way it does not develop elsewhere. There will be two pieces of legislation that will give the opportunity to the opposition to state their position in relation to these questions. The first one deals with the law -  that is, the extent to which people are able to access our courts and get different outcomes to those outcomes that they would get if they were making their claims elsewhere and they were assessed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.You can by way of a privative clause - and I have explained this to honourable members before - limit judicial review. It means decisions would be taken by tribunals that would apply the same convention that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is applying. We would get different outcomes in that situation. - Because you would be applying the law -  - and they would be lawful decisions in accordance with the convention that the United Nations is dealing with. I will come to that, because there will be some further legislation introduced tomorrow to give some guidance to decision makers in this area - some guidance that will restore the refugee convention to the same convention that is applied internationally and which does produce different results.Let me make this point in relation to the privative clause: under the privative clause, which we use in numerous legislation here in Australia already, we limit the right of Australians to be able to access the courts, because people have been given appeals to administrative bodies. Most of that happens in the industrial relations area. The Labor Party are saying that they oppose this measure. They have opposed this measure, and they have foreshadowed all along that they oppose this measure - and no amount of prevarication by the honourable member for Bowman, as evidenced on radio today, suggesting, `We might still look at it,' can disguise the fact that they have opposed it all the way down the line. That is what they have done. In relation to this matter, they are giving people who are coming to Australia unlawfully an entitlement to access our courts in a way which we do not give Australians to access our courts where administrative tribunals have been set up.What would we be doing differently, if we were to implement a privative clause, to that which other countries are doing? I noticed recently there were some suggestions that New Zealand was better at dealing with these matters than we are. I picked up on 21 August a copy of the Dominion newspaper, in which the senior liaison officer of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Hans ten Feld, was quoted. He makes it very clear that the problem in dealing with asylum issues is how long you take to resolve those matters. If you give people the opportunity to go to the courts, they take a much longer period of time. Many hundreds of people that we are detaining today are still being detained because they are exercising that right to take their decisions, which have been a rejection by the department and a rejection by the independent merits review tribunal, to a court. We know that when they go to the court only one per cent of people get a different outcome.This is not a situation in which the decisions are being taken incorrectly by those tribunals. The fact is that the article, in regard to the UNHCR commenting on this aspect of Australia's policy, went on to say:... its multi-step appeals system meant claimants could be held for years, he said. New Zealand's two-step system of an initial decision made by the Immigration Service's refugee status branch followed by appeals to the Refugee Status Appeals Authority was quicker and cheaper.In other words, the international way of dealing with these matters means that you do not introduce judicial review, which you know delays decision making, exacerbates the concerns that people have, and fuels the arguments that are being put now that people are anxious about their situations in detention and are becoming increasingly more difficult to manage.The fact is that there will be some further legislation - besides the legislation dealing with the privative clause - dealt with in the parliament in the next week. That legislation will restore the application of the refugee convention relating to the status of refugees, will more carefully define what is meant by persecution, and will make it very clear when you have a court deciding that, if a person cannot get the job of his choice in his home country which befits his qualifications, that can constitute persecution leading to a refugee outcome. If that decision is upheld in every case - no doubt we will appeal it but that will take time - you can imagine how few cases you can reject. The fact of the matter is that one of the significant determining factors - and it is in our hands how we deal with it - is the relative attractiveness of Australia over and above other countries where people can put their claims and have them dealt with. One of those significant factors that makes Australia more attractive is the extent to which people are more likely to get their claims up here than if they are considered by the international body. The figures that I have given bear that out. It is a very tragic situation when people believe that they can put pressure on us, as we are now seeing people being put under pressure, under duress, in relation to being trafficked into Australia: `If you do not give us what we want, we will threaten you or we will threaten ourselves.' That is a very difficult situation to deal with. I very much regret that in delaying so long in dealing with these matters we have created an environment where as many as 2,500 people are sitting in Indonesia believing that it is more attractive to get to Australia to put their claims than to have them dealt with by the international body, the UNHCR, which does protect people in Indonesia.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asked me whether I have misled the House and I am happy to address that question. Last Thursday the opposition made a number of allegations against me and tabled documents that they claimed supported these allegations. Last Friday, after examining the documents tabled by the opposition and refreshing my memory from minutes of meetings and diaries, I issued a detailed statement outlining the circumstances surrounding that issue. I table a copy of the statement. I remind members of the House that in parliament on this matter I said:I am not aware of anything untoward that has been done in the FEC. My understanding is that the books of the FEC have been audited. I am not aware that the auditor has any concerns with regard to the financial operations of the FEC. - I would like to provide some details regarding the operational aspects of the Groom FEC finances as well as my involvement in the administrative and financial matters handled by the Groom FEC. Like most members of the House, I do not involve myself in the day-to-day financial affairs of my FEC. My position is that it needs to meet its legal, financial, tax and other obligations. It is my understanding that the Groom FEC has always sought to do so and I consider this is, in fact, supported by the documents tabled by the opposition last week.Let me talk about the actual circumstances surrounding this matter. On 23 November I was delighted to host a function involving the Treasurer.  - It was a good function. It was held at the Picnic Point function centre and was well attended. Catering was provided by Picnic Point, and the documents tabled reveal that the total account was $9,090.55, including a GST component of $826.41. As the documents tabled show, an invoice was made out to the Liberal Party, PO Box 777, Toowoomba, and a receipt was issued for the payment of that amount. The account was paid by Mrs Watts on behalf of the Groom FEC the day after the dinner. The account was paid in full, including the GST. Subsequently, in December, I understand from a discussion that I had with Neville Stewart, a member of the FEC and Queensland state executive, that accounts over $2,000 were to be paid by the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. I understood from the discussion that the arrangements were based on advice received from the Queensland division. My attention has since been drawn to minutes of a meeting of the FEC on 21 November, a copy of which I table. In those minutes it was noted that the chairperson notified the treasurer, Mrs Watts, that C. Galtos and G. Jaeschke, state president and state director, requested that tax invoices for the dinner be forwarded to them. While I attended this meeting, I was not there for all of it, as I arrived late after attending the launch of a retirement village in my electorate. Mrs Dellys Kelly, who attended that FEC meeting, has informed my office today that she has a diary note stating that, on my arrival at that FEC meeting, I apologised for being late.As I have indicated in the statement I issued on Friday, on 18 December I received a telephone call from Mrs Margaret Watts expressing her concern about the process proposed by the Queensland division for the settlement of the account for the fundraising dinner held on 23 November. I informed Mrs Watts that the FEC finances were an organisational matter to be determined by the FEC executive. I did this because I had confidence in the Groom FEC executive. I was aware that a meeting of the Groom FEC executive was to take place the next day. As members may be aware, the next day it was announced that I was to be appointed as the Minister for Small Business. I am still grateful to the Prime Minister for that; it has been very enjoyable, I have to say!As well as attending the meeting of the Groom FEC executive, I had to deal with other matters. For example, I was receiving calls from friends and colleagues as well as from the media. I was also being interviewed by a journalist. While the documents tabled last week show that I attended the FEC executive meeting, I was understandably not in attendance for all of the meeting. There was a range of issues discussed at the meeting, as set out by the meeting agenda and minutes tabled last week. I was not present during the discussion of financial matters. That has been confirmed to me in a number of statutory declarations that I have, and I table those documents.The document tabled last week relating to this meeting confirmed that in the memorandum to members of the Groom FEC executive, signed by Mrs Watts, Mrs Watts outlined a conversation she had with Graham Jaeschke regarding accounts over $2,000. The notes of the accounts dated 19 December also show that Graham Jaeschke had also raised this with the FEC chairman. The notes then went on to outline how this process would apply to the Picnic Point dinner. Additionally, I note that the notes to accounts indicate that, if the FEC executive agreed to the proposal, Mrs Watts was prepared to finalise the arrangement the next day. The minutes also note that there was a discussion in relation to GST and the ABN issues and the meeting undertook to request further advice as soon as possible from the state director `on the policy for claiming GST on campaigning or, if there was not a current policy, how far away is it?'At a subsequent meeting of the FEC, on 23 January, the minutes of the 20 December meeting were amended to specifically note that the concerns raised by Mrs Watts were correctly recorded. Further, it was noted `after much discussion and on the advice of Neville Stewart, Queensland vice-president, that the FEC should accept the direction of the secretariat on this matter'. These documents show that the Groom FEC received verbal advice from the Queensland division that bills over $2,000 were to be forwarded to head office for payment. The minutes of the December meeting - both the original and those amended at the request of Mrs Watts - record discussion in relation to the GST and make it clear that Mrs Watts's concerns were raised and discussed and a decision was reached to abide by the verbal advice received from the Queensland division and that clarification was being sought from the Queensland division on the policy for claiming GST. Subsequent to the December meeting, I took leave over the Christmas period prior to taking up my appointment as Minister for Small Business. As best as I can recall, the next time this issue was raised with me was after the 23 January meeting of the FEC, which I did not attend. I was advised by the chair that at this meeting Mrs Watts had announced her resignation. Mr Speaker, this paragraph is particularly important. The minutes of the January meeting also show that the executive again sought advice from the Queensland division on this issue and also took the precaution of seeking formal written advice from a local accountant. This advice was sought by the FEC executive to ensure that the FEC would meet its tax obligations, not avoid them. This advice was sought at the formal direction of the executive. Additionally, at this meeting the executive resolved to freeze the funds in question - a sum of $826.41 - until the issue was resolved. Following the January meeting and before the February meeting, when the Queensland division realised they had made a mistake with their advice to the Groom FEC they advised the Groom FEC and apologised in person - Graham Jaeschke attended the meeting on 20 February - for the confusion at the FEC meeting held on 20 February.It was then the Queensland division's responsibility to amend its December quarter BAS return to the amount of $75.12 when it lodged its March quarter BAS return, as is the procedure under GST law. The Queensland division also disclosed this discrepancy voluntarily to the ATO. At all times, the Groom FEC acted on the basis that the advice from the Queensland division was correct and, when told of a mistake by the Queensland division, the Groom FEC accepted that advice immediately.I made my statement to this House the other day that I was not aware of anything untoward that had been done in the Groom FEC, based upon my understanding that the Groom FEC had at all times acted in an appropriate manner. I was not aware of the mechanics of the process initially proposed by the Queensland division to settle the account for the dinner. Comments made by Mr David Watts on ABC television yesterday support this. The statement that I made, that I was not aware that anything untoward had been done in the Groom FEC - that is, my FEC - was correct. I was not aware of anything untoward that has been done by the FEC. In fact, I think they have acted on the basis of advice at all times.As I outlined in my statement issued on Friday, at the FEC executive meeting of 20 February an auditor's report for the period 1 July 2000 to 23 January was tabled. This report did refer to the issue. The auditor's report said:As this was entirely a branch function there appears to be no reason why the Queensland Division should be involved.The Groom FEC accounts were subsequently audited for the period 1 July 2000 to 31 March 2001. The auditor's report covering this period does not raise any concerns in regard to the financial operations of the FEC as, by the time of this audit, the matters in relation to the GST had been dealt with. My statement that the books of the FEC had been audited was correct, as is my statement that I am not aware that the auditor had any concerns in regard to the financial operations of the FEC.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the member for Cook for his question and recognise his interest and the interest of other members in the fate of Diana Thomas and Peter Bunch, who are, as the member said in his question, the two Australian aid workers who are currently incarcerated in Afghanistan. I have told the House before that I am very concerned about the fate of these two Australians, and we are doing everything we possibly can to try to get them released. I do welcome confirmation by the International Committee of the Red Cross that its representatives, which included two doctors and a nurse, were yesterday able to visit the Australian aid workers, as well as the other German and American aid workers, in Kabul. The Australian High Commission officials are currently seeking an urgent debriefing from the International Committee of the Red Cross for a detailed account of the visit, and we are very anxious to hear, through the Red Cross, of the health and welfare of the Australians. I am able to confirm, though, that personal care items which were taken by the Australian Consul, Alastar Adams, to Kabul last week have now been passed to Ms Thomas and Mr Bunch.The Australian High Commission in Islamabad has been advised that our consul will be issued today with a visa, again to travel to Afghanistan. The consul hopes to travel to Kabul later today with the German and the American consuls - on, I understand, a United Nations aircraft. Indications have been received from authorities in Afghanistan that it will be possible for the consular representatives, including the Australian consul, to have access to Ms Thomas and Mr Bunch. The government, though, as I said, does remain deeply concerned for the welfare of Diana Thomas and Peter Bunch, and we will continue to do everything we can to secure their release and also, in the meantime, to gain consular access to them. We are working very closely with the Americans and the Germans and also the United Nations.Honourable members may be reassured that my department is retaining very close contact with the Thomas and Bunch families. I know I speak on behalf of all members of this House when I say that those families very much have our sympathy and support. Our consul in Islamabad will today carry messages from the families to Kabul, messages which he hopes to be able to convey personally.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question, and I acknowledge his long-time interest in tax arrangements for helping families and children. When this government was first elected, in 1997 it introduced a family tax initiative which was an increase in the tax-free threshold for families of $1,000 for each child. That gave families with children additional income by way of tax cuts or, if they preferred, through the payments system. In addition to that, we introduced for a single income family an increase of $2,500 in the tax-free threshold, which gave the single income family additional help. When we reintroduced further tax reform on 1 July last year, we introduced additional benefits for families which increased family assistance in this country by $2.4 billion. The family tax initiative doubled the tax-free threshold for children and for single families, and we gave families an opportunity to take that either by way of tax cuts or through the payments system.On the weekend some of the newspapers reported modelling which had been done by NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. NATSEM has not always been a friend of the government. In fact, during the tax debate, as I recall it, work done by NATSEM was relied upon by people who were opposing the government in its policies. So, when you find an institution which has not been particularly friendly to the government which reports information like this, it is especially significant.NATSEM did an analysis which compared the situation of families between 1996, when this government was elected, and 2001 after the introduction of the new tax system. It found that a single income, two-parent family with two children on average weekly earnings gained $88 per week, largely as a result of family assistance. It also found that a sole parent - you will hear the Labor Party claim from time to time that the government has been hard on sole parents - two-child family totally reliant on government assistance gained $59 a week over the last five years. Those families are $59 a week better off. That is very interesting when you actually compare what happened to that same group of families between 1982 and 1995. Remember, under this government, the single income family got an $88 a week increase and the sole parent family got a $59 increase. What happened between 1982 and 1995? NATSEM concluded:The losers during this period were children living in couple families where only one of their parents worked. Single-income families showed a 4 per cent drop over this period.So under 13 years of Labor, the disposable income of single income families declined by four per cent. After five years of coalition government single income, two-parent families are up $88 a week and sole parent families are up $59 a week. This is the side of the House which has always supported families with children.Then you add into that the following: interest rates for families were 10½ per cent when the government was elected and they are 6.8 per cent now. Compare that with the interest rates under Labor. Compare also the abolition of the financial institutions duty, another cut for families, and this government's record of achievement in relation to tax reform has made families better off and redressed some of the policies of the Labor Party which did, and were designed to, make them worse off during the period from 1982 to 1995.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Last week in the House we had the Leader of the Opposition holding up a graph and saying the following:Doesn't this chart, based on official Australian Institute of Health and Welfare figures, show that the proportion of total public hospital expenditure met by the Commonwealth has been declining under you? Doesn't this show that, if you had continued to match the states in funding 45 per cent of public hospital spending - the percentage as at 1996 - our public hospitals would have received another $200 million a year?Since the Leader of the Opposition held up that graph, I have had a chance to look at it. I can give the Leader of the Opposition an answer to his question, and it is an emphatic no. As I suspected, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on this data set is always a couple of years behind because the states are inordinately slow in providing the data on which this analysis is made. In fact, the last year of the official AIHW figures that were held up by the Leader of the Opposition is 1997-98. They are three years old. So, far from showing anything about the government, they in fact show something very substantial about the last health care agreements with the states signed by the Labor government in 1993. They show that when that agreement was first signed the Commonwealth was funding 49 per cent of hospital expenditure. That dropped to 45 per cent over the life of the agreement. Other funds came from private health funds and from other private sources. So the data set that the Leader of the Opposition held up is in fact an extraordinarily good analysis of the failure of policy under the previous Labor government and the two-year extension into the life of this government by which we were bound.One of the things that made it particularly difficult for states under the previous health care agreements signed by the Labor Party was the drop-out in private health insurance. The hospitals were under pressure because of this, as shown by a statement from the then Labor minister for health, the member for Fremantle, on 29 March 1995 in this place when she said:Yes, there is more pressure on public hospitals because of the decline in private health insurance. After all, the health care agreements had been predicated in 1993 on the fact that, if there were a drop of more than two per cent in private health insurance, the agreements would be reviewed and there was the expectation that additional resources would be provided. That, of course, never happened under the previous Labor government. So the states had to pick up the load, and their share over the life of that agreement went from 40 per cent to 47 per cent. If you wish to compare that to the current health care agreements, you cannot use the data that I tabled, because we do not have the ability to take out non-hospital expenditure that appears in the states' budget papers as hospital expenditure, something only the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare can do - thus the `apples and oranges' that I mentioned in the House. But you can look at the relative increase in expenditure at the Commonwealth and state levels. The Commonwealth's increase in expenditure since we signed the new agreement in 1998 is 7.3 per cent a year; the states' increase in expenditure is 3.8 per cent a year.The honourable member for Corangamite also asked me about relative responsibility for health care. We did have a look to see what was on the record and we have been able to come up with a number of comments. The Prime Minister in this House last week of course mentioned the Premier of Queensland, who said the states run the hospitals. But this was not the first time a Labor figure has said it. We can start as far back as Dr Blewett in 1986 when in Hansard he said:... the administration of the public hospitals is primarily the responsibility of the States.Brian Howe, in a radio interview on PM in 1992, said:The states obviously have to administer the hospital system.The member for Fremantle in 1994 said:The states are principally responsible for the state of the hospitals.The fact is everyone other than the Leader of the Opposition seems to understand very clearly where responsibility lies here. This is hardly surprising if you have a look at the Leader of the Opposition's record in government for his own portfolios and the responsibility he took for the failures during that time. He was defence minister when we signed the dud subs contract, a $2.24 billion contract that is now costing us $5.5 billion, and he has refused to take responsibility for it. He was minister for communications between 1990 and 1991, when we had the chance to get some real competition by dividing Telecom and OTC, an option he did not take because the unions did not wish him to do it. He was Minister for Finance for 18 days in 1991, and I can inform honourable members he did not have the chance to mess anything up on that occasion. But he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training between 1991 and 1993, when unemployment hit 11.3 per cent and youth unemployment 34.8 per cent, and it was again someone else's responsibility. And he was Minister for Finance between 1993 and 1996, when we had a $10 billion black hole, which also was not his responsibility. So the answer to the honourable member for Corangamite's question is absolutely clear: when it comes to responsibility, it is anyone's except the Leader of the Opposition's.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. Trying to get some balance back into the health care system has been one of the biggest challenges the Howard government has faced. Getting some balance back is important, because choice in health care, as with choice in education, is one of the fundamental things that Australians value. The 30 per cent rebate has been one of our fundamental successes. That was shown by figures that were released last week by the Private Health Insurance Administrative Council, which I previously mentioned in the House. Those figures show that over the previous 12 months episodes in private hospitals are up 17 per cent and money paid by private health funds is up $792 million, or nearly 17 per cent. That is backed up by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, whose figures from 1999-2000 show that one in every three hospital patients now is a private patient, and that in that year private hospital services went up 8.1 per cent and public hospital services went up 0.3 per cent. So a much greater share of the increased demand for hospitals is now being taken by the private sector.The other thing that the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows, and which has had no publicity, is that there has been much comment about people having insurance and electing to use public hospital treatment. That is, after all, someone's right under the way we run our health care system, and I do not criticise it, but I observe that 10 years ago 45 per cent of people in public hospitals who had private health insurance were opting not to use it. The figure today is 13.5 per cent, which is a very dramatic decrease that gives a consequent increase of revenue into state hospitals.The honourable member also asked if I knew about any alternative policies. It is 344 days since Cathy Freeman won the gold medal for the 400 metres in the Olympics and 334 days since the Leader of the Opposition announced a $2 billion decision by the Labor Party, one that has not had a subsequent press release. On the weekend we had some elaboration as to why the opposition has been so reticent in coming forward about that $2 billion decision. In an article by Paul Kelly in the Weekend Australian, he stated:Labor's shadow health minister Jenny Macklin has had deep worries over the policy consequences of Labor's decision.that being the decision to keep the 30 per cent rebate. It is hardly surprising that the Labor Party attempt to say one thing - not put out a press release, not clarify what their position is - and at the same time maintain deep concerns over the future. The Australian public should similarly have deep concerns. The simple fact is that we saw the elaboration of this in Aston during the by-election. We saw the Labor Party say that they would not abolish the 30 per cent rebate and that they would not means test it. But we have not had a commitment not to reduce it, we have not had a commitment not to grandfather it, and we have not had a commitment not to take it off extras. The fact is that the Labor Party are looking for a way to get out of the 30 per cent rebate, and we have every right to continue to assert that. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. One of the real challenges that we have had is to try and get cancer services into rural areas, because there is some evidence that people in rural areas are getting different treatment from people in city areas. That is a challenge because the best estimates we have are that you need a catchment of about half a million people to provide practical facilities and have a throughput that will enable people who are using those facilities to maintain their skills. Even with that caveat, I have recently been able to approve new facilities at Wagga Wagga in New South Wales and Nambour in Queensland. They are two machine facilities for the treatment of cancer.However, in the end, it is not a long-term solution because, given Australia's enormous geography, no other country has the challenges we have in providing cancer treatment to a population, and particularly an ageing population as in rural Australia. In last year's budget, we were able to fund a joint trial with Victoria where we can look at the provision of cancer services through a single-machine facility, and I am pleased to say that we are going to go ahead in Ballarat, Bendigo and Traralgon to see if a single-machine facility is able to provide the level of service, training and continuing education for the medical profession, the radiologists and physicists who are needed to run these machines.This is a complex area and one that states and territories have been grappling with for some time. It has come up at most Commonwealth-state health ministers' meetings we have had over recent years, in formal or informal discussions. As I have mentioned in the House, it is disappointing that the College of Radiologists, which were funded by the Commonwealth for $100,000 to attempt to come up with a strategic plan to fix this, instead chose to use the money to provide an audit and then attempt to highlight what were the most alarmist issues raised out of this audit, without any balance. Not only did the audit fail to take into account the work being done in the states; its findings were also unsubstantiated and, according to my department, in some cases were based on biased data.As I said in the House last week, one of the problems here is that, even if you had extra machines and facilities, you do not have the trained people to run them. Again, this is largely an issue that has fallen to state and territory level, but the Commonwealth has decided to take some leadership in this area. I have announced that we are going to have a wider review than has been done previously and, rather than just looking at the hardware and at the doctors, we are going to look at the area where there is probably the greatest difficulty and the greatest bottleneck, and that is in the technicians running the machines and the area of nuclear physics.The technicians are often left out of the debate in this regard. They are not particularly well remunerated. Overseas they are doing a greater part of the planning and treatment, and I want to see if that is possible in Australia. I am pleased to say that the New South Wales health minister has agreed to put a person of his choosing on this committee to get some good federal-state linkages, because in the end it is a federal-state issue that is going to have to fix it. This review has extensive terms of reference. I am pleased to be able to say that Professor Peter Baume, a former minister in the Senate, a professor of medicine and the Chancellor of the Australian National University, has agreed to chair it. The inquiry will report back by March next year and will set the scene for how we go forward with this issue. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. Since 1996, we have worked very hard on issues of rural medical education for a very simple reason: I am firmly of the view that the drop-off in country kids going to medical school is one of the big reasons why we have difficulty attracting doctors to rural areas. While this is a long-term solution, it will not work in the absence of short- and medium-term solutions. In the end, if someone had started to act on this 10 years ago, we would not have the challenges that we have today.When we came into government, around eight per cent of the 1996 med school intake was from kids from a rural background. With 45 per cent of those kids going back to country areas, we had perhaps only four or five per cent of that total intake that we could reasonably expect to go back to rural Australia. We have worked hard to get the numbers up, and one of the ways we have done that has been through university departments of rural health and clinical schools, something we flagged initially in the 1996 election policy and which we have expanded since. We have established 10 clinical schools in regional and rural Australia and 10 university departments of rural health.I can give the honourable member an idea of some of the successes of this. Adelaide University Rural Clinical School is based in the electorate of Grey at Whyalla. It recently appointed a deputy director, Dr Andrew Thornette, who will be an associate professor of rural primary care at the new clinical school. The prospect of five years ago attracting someone like this to work in Whyalla was absolutely unthinkable. The new University of New South Wales Rural Clinical School in the Greater Murray area attracted Professor Mohamed Khadra, a senior urologist, in 1999 as the foundation chair of the clinical school. He has been able to continue to work as an urologist at the same time as running the Greater Murray clinical school. This year, this school is taking 12 full-time fourth year medical students who will supplement 58 medical students doing part rotations through rural New South Wales. The university department of rural health at Launceston has just established two more rural health teaching sites at Dover and Flinders Island and it plans a third one on King Island. These sites are in addition to the ones already operating at Scottsdale, Queenstown, St Marys, Smithton and Sorell. These places now have medical students where they could never previously have contemplated attracting a medical student. The Broken Hill university department of rural health has established specific criteria for training Aboriginal health workers who can now stay in their communities and complete a university degree. This university department of rural health has been recognised by the New South Wales Premier awards and the Baxter award for excellence in health care. A centre for remote health in Alice Springs has developed the Out of Alice program, which sends medical students out to remote areas for six months at a time as part of their training. None of this was happening five years ago. All this innovation in medical education is attracting more students from country areas into medical school. It is one of the reasons why nearly a quarter of all our medical students who entered med school this year came from a rural background - a figure we expect will increase next year when country students will actually be overrepresented in medical training. We have not just focused on doctors; we are also trying to get nurses out into rural areas. The member for Eden-Monaro tells me that 25 extra nursing places have recently gone to Bega.I was asked if I knew of any alternative policies on medical education in rural areas; I do not. We checked on the shadow minister, including her press releases, to see whether in 2½ years she had made any comments on this, and we can find nothing. We have no idea what the Labor Party would do were they to be in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Mental health is one of the great hidden problems in society. Some estimates are that up to 20 per cent of Australians in a year will experience a mental health or substance abuse problem. The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020 mental health problems will be the second greatest burden of illness in the Western world, second only to cardiovascular disease.With that said, I am pleased to report to honourable members that I believe that Australia leads the world in its approach to mental illness and its specific initiatives aimed at assisting people with mental illness. Some of these have been under way for a substantial period of time. The National Mental Health Strategy had its genesis in 1992. It was first funded in 1993. I am pleased to be able to say that in 1998 the Howard government committed an additional $300 million to fund the second National Mental Health Strategy. That $300 million goes straight to the state and territory governments and $28 million to national level activities. This has been supporting a substantial shift from institutional care to community care - something that is the envy of most Western nations. The second thing that we have done is fund the Beyond Blue initiative. We committed $17 million to it, which has been matched by state and territory governments. It has been very successful, and I think it will end up changing community attitudes towards mental illness. Beyond Blue has some very simple approaches and some very simple aims. It hopes specifically to raise resilience amongst schoolchildren and to develop greater understanding and awareness of postnatal depression. Also, it has conducted a series of public awareness fora, the most recent last week using Australian Rules football.Also, in this year's budget we committed $120 million to change the way general practice approaches mental illness. Something raised with me time and time again by GPs is that the nature of the Medicare schedule does not allow them to spend enough time with people with mental health problems. So we can offer people chemical treatments for depression, but we cannot offer people cognitive behavioural therapy, which is a non-chemical based treatment. The initiative is going to do three things. It is going to give GPs skills in diagnosing illness and providing basic treatments. It is going to encourage GPs to make links with psychiatrists and psychologists, and for the first time ever in a limited way Medicare is going to fund psychological treatment, as well as psychiatric treatment - that is, we will fund the medical as well as the non-medical. And, thirdly, it is going to give GPs assistance in early diagnosis and intervention.Australia is sufficiently recognised that we have had a number of international people come to have a look at our National Mental Health Strategy and the way we approach mental illness. The most recent was Dr David Satcher, the US Surgeon General, before launching his own Surgeon General's report on mental illness. The only country in the world he chose to visit to look at mental health issues was Australia.The honourable member also asked me if I knew of any alternate approaches to this problem and I would very much like to be able to report that I do. Indeed, on 22 July 1999, the member for Jagajaga in a speech to the Nurses Federation outlined her major areas of policy development, one of which was policy to tackle the special needs of mental health. Two years, one month and five days later, we still do not have any detailed policies from the opposition as to how they would approach mental illness, what they would do differently or indeed what they would do at all if they were in government. Mental health issues have enjoyed bipartisan support in this House. I look forward to being able to give some bipartisan support to the opposition if they are ever able to come up with a policy.</DOC>

 - I am sure the House would be aware of the circumstances whereby the Norwegian vessel Tampa rescued 434 prospective unauthorised arrivals from their disabled vessel north of Christmas Island on Sunday, 26 August. Having rescued the individuals, the freighter was proceeding to the Indonesian port of Merak at the direction of the Indonesian search and rescue authority. We understand that the freighter subsequently turned back to Christmas Island at the insistence of the rescued individuals.The government has requested that the Tampa not enter Australian territorial waters and that it should continue on its original route to Indonesia. That position has been repeated in exchanges between the Australian government and the government of Indonesia. We continue to seek the assistance of the Norwegian and the Indonesian governments to secure an acceptable solution for all concerned.I can confirm to the House that Australian personnel have been flown to Christmas Island by C130 Hercules to provide any humanitarian assistance, such as food, water, medical supplies and safety equipment, that may be required. A doctor on Christmas Island is available to provide medical assistance. And the government is in the process of sourcing a helicopter with winching capacity to transfer any necessary supplies or other assistance from Christmas Island to the Tampa if necessary.I have been informed that the master of the vessel - and this has been the subject of some comment in the media this morning -  has not requested any security assistance from Australia in relation to activity on board the vessel. This vessel is a very large container vessel built in 1984. It has a very substantial capacity. It is partly a roll-on, roll-off vessel. Whilst the conditions on the vessel would obviously not be comfortable, it is a very large vessel and, of course, significantly larger than many of the craft on which unauthorised arrivals have come to Australia.I should also inform the House that the government has decided to deploy HMAS Arunta to the Christmas Island vicinity. I understand it will leave Fremantle later this afternoon or early this evening and be within the Christmas Island area within a few days.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question and for his concern about this difficult issue. My department has been in close contact with both the Norwegian and the Indonesian authorities through the course of yesterday and overnight, in an attempt to try to find a resolution to the problem of the MV Tampa and its passengers. This morning I also personally discussed the issue with the Indonesian ambassador to Australia.My department and I in all of our discussions have made it clear that we are concerned to find an outcome which addresses the humanitarian needs of the rescued passengers; but it is also critical for Australia that such an outcome protect the integrity of our immigration laws and our sovereign right to determine who enters this country. It is important that people understand that Australia has no obligation under international law to accept the rescued persons into Australian territory. I note that the fishing boat from which the 434 persons were rescued in international waters set off from Indonesia and was crewed by Indonesians.After picking up the stranded passengers - and it is very important to understand this fact - the Tampa was en route to the Indonesian port of Merak, where the passengers were to have disembarked and where the captain intended to have them disembark. The fact is that, under a form of duress, the captain of the ship was made to turn the ship around and make it head for Christmas Island. In these circumstances, we do not think it appropriate to succumb to duress. What is more, the entry of the rescued persons into Australia is neither reasonable nor lawful under Australia's immigration laws. In our view, the ship should return those rescued either to their point of departure or to the original intended destination of the ship, as would be the normal practice in these circumstances. Australia is concerned about the welfare of those on board and, as the Prime Minister said in answer to an earlier question, is providing humanitarian assistance to them, including food, water and, of course, medical attention.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. The answer in relation to each of the questions the member asked is of course yes. But the issue that we have to address here is why there are numbers of people who are prepared to engage in quite inappropriate behaviour, to put captains of ships under duress, to put officials of my department and those who are charged with assisting people here in Australia under duress - what is it that drives people to behave in this way? Some would say that it is the desperation that some of these people face, but the fact is that there are very significant differences in outcome, depending upon whether you are in Australia or you are making your claims elsewhere. That is the point that I made yesterday - that if you have people from Afghanistan, or who claim to be Afghani but may in fact be Pakistani, who arrive in Australia without documentation, which we know they have had, and make their claims, they have an 84 per cent chance of being accepted; but if those same groups with documents are being assessed elsewhere, 14 per cent of the assessments by the UNHCR are accepted. That is a significant difference, and it applies not only to Afghani; it applies to Iraqi and Iranian, and that is the fact.Then you couple that with access to income support if people are found to be refugees and you couple it with access to universal health care, and you have people who are in the business of people smuggling who trade on those factors. They now go out and advertise that we have reduced the time that people might remain in detention because we have been anxious to ensure that that period is as short as possible. Australia does accept its international obligations and does so honourably. It exercises them conscientiously, but it does not accept that our refugee and humanitarian program will be managed by people smugglers.I will be introducing today legislation that will ensure that the determination process is in accordance with our international obligations and is the same process that is applied by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It will restore the intention of the refugee convention. It will also address those issues that have evolved from our jurisprudential model - that is, the extent to which the courts have determined that in Australia we will be significantly more generous in the way in which these issues are addressed. It will ensure that there is an onus on those people who come without documents to identify themselves in a meaningful way with verifiable documents, and if they do not do that without just excuse, adverse implications will be able to be drawn. These measures, coupled with some others, will be crucial to ensuring that we reduce Australia's relative attractiveness - not because we are being dishonourable and denying genuine refugees protection, but because people who are not refugees are able to gain it. It will also be dependent upon containing the gratuitous advice as to the way in which the convention is interpreted that arises through the jurisprudential model. The opposition will have an opportunity this week or when we return to vote on the judicial review bill, and I heard the opposition spokesman saying that they are still opposed to it because it is unconstitutional. If it is unconstitutional, let the courts throw it out. But what it would mean is that all the other privative clauses used by Labor governments from time immemorial to sustain the industrial relations system of this country would also be struck down. That is what it would mean. That is the implication. If this matter is to be a contest between this place, another place and the courts as to the way in which the law will be interpreted, let it be at issue. But the fact is that, on all the advice available to me, this bill is not unconstitutional.The further point I would make is that the cost of judicial review is growing exponentially. This year it is in excess of $15 million. There are 200 people in detention awaiting the outcome of cases, despite decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal. Those 200 people remain in detention right now because they are pursuing cases before the courts where they have already been found not to be refugees. Then we have the class actions bill, which the Labor Party is opposing, which involves some 6,000 people who are maintaining themselves here in Australia on the pretext of being lawful because they are pursuing litigation as part of a class action. The fact is that over 600 unsuccessful refugee applicants who have already had their day in court, have already had their chance before the tribunal, are using that system now to maintain themselves here in Australia.What I lament is the opposition that says, `We support 90 per cent of what you're about. We'll cherry pick and say which proposals we'll accept, but we'll knock off the ones we wish to.' The opposition were in this chamber the other day saying, `We support the measures that are designed to protect Australian workers who are managing detention centres from possible risk to their life and safety by being able to undertake searches to ascertain whether people have weapons,' but when that matter got to the Senate - after you had given us a promise of support - you joined with the Democrats and the others to send it off to a committee to delay the handling of the matter and you will not join us in ensuring that it will pass. If you are serious about these matters, there will be support for all of the measures that the government has sought to implement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I can inform him that the Yellow Pages business survey was released today. It showed that confidence levels across Australian small to medium business improved markedly in the last quarter to the highest level since November 1999. Mr Speaker, 61 per cent of small and medium enterprises feel confident about their prospects for the next 12 months. The increase in confidence was reported across most industries, including hospitality, finance, insurance, communication, property and the business services sector. I think all members of the House would say that to see a return of confidence to small business is a good thing and welcome - at least all members on this side of the House will welcome it. No doubt the Labor Party will be unhappy about small business increasing its confidence. But for the small business sector that is good news. It reflects the fact that after coming through the December quarter, which was a negative quarter, with transitional effects to the new taxation system, after coming through the international downturn, a recovery of confidence is being widely reflected in the Australian business community.The Yellow Pages also asks small business today which party it believes is better for handling taxation matters, and I thought the House might be interested in this. Small business was asked which party they thought would provide a fairer tax system, and 16 per cent said Labor; 40 per cent named the coalition - three to one. They were asked who they thought was the best for limiting tax for small business, and 11 per cent said the Labor Party; 42 per cent said the coalition - 42 per cent to 11 per cent. They were asked which party they thought was the best for ensuring that interest rates do not rise: 51 per cent said the coalition and five per cent said the Labor Party. The number that supported the Labor Party was about a third of the Labor Party's maximum interest rate of 17 per cent. They were asked which party was the best for controlling inflation: 61 per cent said that it was the coalition. But this is the one I really liked: which was the best for controlling the deficit -  - They always interject the loudest when they like the news the least. The small business response on which party was the best for controlling the deficit: coalition, 69 per cent; Labor Party, four per cent. I do not know why the Labor Party only had four per cent, because that favourite clipping that I go to bed with every night from the Financial Review includes in it the Labor Party's promise for bigger surpluses. Why is it that only four per cent of small businesses have got the message when, after all, the Labor Party is going to roll back the GST, it is going to spend on the noodle nation, it is going to increase its expenditures on health - and it is going to do all of that with a bigger surplus. As I keep on saying: why didn't we think of that?It is probably six or seven weeks today since the noodle nation was released by the Labor Party. I think in all of that time since its release we have not had in this House one question on the noodle nation. There has not been one question on the noodle nation, which was going to be the centrepiece of the Labor Party's plan for the next election. There have been no questions this week in relation to health, which after last week's caucus meeting was going to be the great counterattack from the Labor Party, no mention of education and no mention of the roll-backwards either. These are policies of the Labor Party which dare not speak their name. It is no surprise that only four per cent of small business believe that Labor can control its deficits. In fact, one would be surprised that it was even as high as four per cent in relation to this survey.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I am aware that, after the release of the exceedingly good Private Health Insurance Administration Council figures, there has been some criticism, particularly coming from the opposition, which is hardly surprising. The opposition seem unimpressed that more revenue is going into the public hospital system from private health insurance companies. In doing so, they really miss the point. That point is that, certainly in the last seven to eight years, public hospitals have lost an incredibly important revenue stream that had always been part of their overall operating budget. This was recognised by all state and territory health ministers and it was recognised by former Labor Party health ministers. Secondly, the health care agreements are worked out in many ways on the figures of the uninsured population. Insured people tend to use private hospitals and, as I said yesterday, the number of people not declaring their insurance status has dropped very dramatically. New South Wales is doing well in this respect, with schemes reported to be in place for public hospitals to actually cover the gap so that it will be more attractive for insured people to use public hospitals. If you actually look at funding going to hospitals on the basis of the uninsured population, which is how it has traditionally been looked at, we get some very interesting figures. I got my department to take these out and I am happy to table them. If you look at constant 1997-1998 dollars, the fact is that in 1993, when Labor signed their last health care agreement, the average dollars per uninsured patient was $426. Over the life of the health care agreement that Labor signed that went to $394 per uninsured patient, a decline to the states of 7½ per cent. Compare that to 1998-1999, the first year of our health care agreement: $425 per person uninsured, to $592 at the end of the health care agreement 2000-2003, an increase of nearly 40 per cent. So there is a very stark contrast here: a 7½ per cent decrease over the life of Labor's health care agreement to the states per uninsured patient; a 39.2 per cent increase over the life of our health care agreement; the sort of increase per uninsured person never previously seen.Arising from comments recently, I have challenged the Labor Party recently to rule out tinkering with the 30 per cent rebate. I have challenged them to rule out grandfathering it, to rule out taking it off ancillaries, to rule out applying it only at the base level premium, and on a number of other things, and pointedly they have refused to do so. Today in the Australian the member for Jagajaga again commented and, after being challenged by the government to rule these things out, all she would say was that Labor would keep the 30 per cent rebate. That is not the point. Keep it in what form? Labor have refused to rule out tinkering with it and have refused to rule out emasculating it. Labor do not like it and, given half a chance, they will destroy the private health rebate, as they did under the Hawke government and under the Whitlam government. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. When we came to government, if you wanted to get a Medicare rebate you had to go to a Medicare office, or, if that was not available, stick your claim in the post and take your luck - that was it. We took the very strong view that we should extend this, and today there are 600 Medicare Easyclaim facilities operating around Australia, along with 226 Medicare offices. The fact is that people now have nearly four times the options that they had five years ago to claim Medicare.There seems to be a more sensible way to do this as well. As part of the memorandum of understanding with general practice that we signed some two years ago, we are exploring claiming Medicare rebates directly from doctors' facilities, or at least lodging the rebates there and having the rebates go back to the individual. We are trialling this currently at Inverell in New South Wales, at Kadina in South Australia and Helensvale in Queensland, and it has been particularly successful. It has 87 per cent community acceptance, which is very high for a new program such as this, and we are hoping to run this right around Australia by the end of the year. This will then mean that it is simple for anyone anywhere with a participating doctor to put in a Medicare claim if they wish in a way that was completely unthinkable five years ago.Electronic health has posed a great challenge for governments right round the world. No government as yet has been perceived to get it right; many governments have got it wrong. Britain in the late 1980s wasted around a billion dollars on trying to get a health information system together that in the end proved useless. A number of countries I visited overseas have had very large government reports, but not much happening on the ground. Australia has taken a much more modest approach, and I believe it will prove to be more successful than most other countries. Australia has the added challenge of having state and territory governments -  there are in fact nine jurisdictions in which we have to operate.The National Health Information Management Advisory Council is just about to release its second report on health online, which is the blueprint for what Commonwealth, states and territories are doing. The Australian health ministers have recently endorsed the next stage of Health Connect. This is a two-year process of research and development prior to a decision on a full roll out of a system. By doing it cooperatively with the states and territories, we have the prospect of avoiding the rail gauge problem of different states and territories doing different things, which is something that has been elusive to us in the past and is an enormous challenge in the future.We have developed public key infrastructure for the Health Insurance Commission, which will allow secure transmission of data, and we have established a Health Electronic Signature Authority, which paves the way for cost-effective and secure transmission of health data over the Internet. In addition, 70 per cent of GPs are now writing computer generated prescriptions - and any honourable member who has recently been to the doctor is likely to have noticed a difference. Four years ago this did not exist. In the United States today, about one per cent of prescriptions are computer generated; we generate 70 per cent.  The Better Medication Management System is looking at creating a secure and comprehensive pharmaceutical health record. This is something that has been elusive in the past. It offers enormous benefits to the community in terms of safety, quality and being able to track different medications provided by different doctors and different pharmacies. It is a completely voluntary system. People choose to opt in if they see benefit to it, and we expect most of the population to do so.</DOC>

 - I have no intention of announcing policy. I welcome the searching question from the member for Calwell, my former tutor. He taught me second year politics at Monash University. I owe him everything I know. I think he considers me to be one of his greatest creations. He gave me a lifetime distrust of left-wing politics in that second year tutorial. The course was called `The Morality of Power' - something that he has exercised ever since. Much as I have a soft spot for my old tutor, and much as the intellectual inspiration which he gave me beats within my heart, I do not always agree with him. And I do not agree with him on this occasion. - I was coming to say that, much as I admire him, I do not always agree with him, and I do not agree with the proposition that he put that recent studies have shown that poorer sections of the community are worse off because of tax reform. I do not believe recent studies have shown that. - Quite the opposite, as the Prime Minister said. A recent study was reported in the Fairfax newspapers on the weekend, by the NATSEM group, which showed that, as a consequence of the government's tax reforms, single income families had improved their position quite considerably.  -  - Somebody throws off at Bettina Arndt from the Labor Party side of the House, but Bettina Arndt is entitled, in my view, to write up the NATSEM results. As I said earlier, NATSEM is certainly not some organisation which is beholden to the government in any way. In fact, as I recall, the Labor Party relied very considerably on NATSEM. As I also recall, NATSEM did the analysis for - most probably even drew - the Labor Party's tax policy at the last federal election. We are all entitled to have a look at what NATSEM did, and in this regard the NATSEM survey which was, yes, written up by Bettina Arndt and was in the Fairfax papers on the weekend, found that single income families had very considerably improved their position under the government's tax changes. A single income family earning $35,000, with one child under five years and a second child who is older, receives additional benefits of $87 a week as a result of tax cuts and increases in family assistance.As that material also found, a single income family that is on a government income support is a big winner. A single income family with a child under five and earning $29,000 receives an additional $59 a week. The truth of the matter is this: if the Labor Party had defeated our tax proposals, single income families today would be much worse off, all Australians would be paying higher income taxes, all companies would be paying higher company taxes, all Australians would also be paying financial institutions duty, and a whole raft of other things.  I was also asked about pensions. The truth of the matter is that the government increased the pension by four per cent and maintains it, in real terms, two per cent above the CPI. That is, two per cent higher, further in front of prices, than it would otherwise have been. That is in addition to the other commitment of the government, and that is that the age pension be legislated to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. That was something which had never been put in legislation before this government came to office. In relation to pensions, there was also the savings bonus of up to $1,000, dollar for dollar, for pensioners; there was the additional $2,000 for the self-funded retiree; there was the announcement in the most recent budget of $300 for age pensioners or part pensioners; there was the announcement in relation to prisoners of war; there was the increase in the Commonwealth seniors health care card; there was the reduction in taxes which are paid by older Australians over 65 years of age; there has been the $2.4 billion increase in family tax assistance, either through the tax system or the payments system; there were reductions in income taxes; and there were reductions in a whole host of other taxes. So, in answer to the honourable member's question, I do not believe that there is such a finding, and the government has made full and adequate compensation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and for her commitment to ensuring that power is exercised responsibly in the Australian community. I am delighted that this dispute at Maintrain is now over, and it is over without any acceptance of the Manusafe scheme - a scheme which is not about protecting existing entitlements but about creating new entitlements; a scheme which if fully implemented would cost some 160,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry alone; and a scheme which is, of course, fully encompassed by the policy of the Australian Labor Party.Let us be very clear about the actions of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union in this dispute - a union which last year gave the Labor Party $680,000; a union which is currently running a half a million dollar marginal seat campaign to support the Leader of the Opposition; and a union which controls the second largest bloc vote inside the Labor Party. First, this union strategically targeted a company in the hope that rail chaos would disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of New South Wales commuters. Second, this union needlessly prolonged a dispute for seven weeks and cost 220 of its members some $5,000 in pay to achieve a result that could have been had on day one. Any union which is involved in an attempt to hold the general community to ransom and which costs its own members thousands and thousands of dollars in a futile dispute deserves to be condemned. Let me quote from a member opposite in responsible mode. The member for Brisbane, the shadow minister for industrial relations, last year said:It is unacceptable that one side in a dispute that thinks it has the muscle or resources to starve out the other, can simply frustrate the process and try and force an outcome irrespective of the merits of their case.That is Labor's theory, but it is not Labor's practice. There was not one word of complaint, let alone condemnation, of this dispute from any member opposite. The New South Wales government completely backed the strike and completely backed the union, even though these workers' jobs were in fact protected by a contract with the New South Wales government. Last night in this House we even had the member for Grayndler actually congratulating Dougie Cameron for `providing leadership in this area'. The reprehensible thing is that for months now the Australian Labor Party has been trying to scare Australian workers that their entitlements are at risk, even though fewer than one-tenth of one per cent of Australian workers will find themselves in the situation of losing a job because of the bankruptcy of their employer. Members opposite have been trying to scare workers at good, solid, decent companies, such as Orange Communications, which is backed by the giant Hutchison Whampoa group, and Maintrain, which is part of the Goninan group - a group which has been in operation for more than a century, which had record profits last year, which has a $1 billion order book and whose chief contracts are with the New South Wales government.It is absolutely disgraceful that members opposite are not interested in workers when they are workers. Members opposite are interested in workers only when they are victims. If members opposite really cared about the workers of Australia, they would not be scaring them about their jobs and their futures; they would be supporting the government's safety net entitlements scheme. But the Australian people are coming to know that Labor means strikes, and strikes cost jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I do not accept the description of what has occurred as a `scam'. That is my first statement. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that he referred to a statement that was released by Mr Crosby, who, might I say, as the senior executive officer of the Liberal Party of Australia has acted throughout the entirety of this with total dispatch and complete transparency. I want to put that point on record. The detailed report that he released yesterday, far from indicating that the alleged scam - which I do not accept - had spread, indicated that, in a total of some hundreds of transactions, a very small number had been found to be in error. The total amount of the shortfall of tax was about $180. - In the case of the Groom Federal Electorate Council, we have had the affairs of this parliament at question time tied up now for three days over a mistaken shortfall of $76. That is the measure of what has been involved. On a scale of one to 10, any alleged misrepresentation -  -  - You talk about a scam -  the misrepresentations by the Leader of the Opposition about health in Western Australia were the scam of the last month.  - No, I have not. I have only just started. - We have a mistaken shortfall, in the case of the Groom FEC, of $76. That pales into insignificance compared with the $4 million a year you get out of Centenary House. If you really want a political -  -  - Mr Speaker, I repeat: I do not accept that what occurred was a scam. It has been explained in some detail by the Minister for Small Business. It has been augmented by the statements made on behalf of the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, both by Mr Lynton Crosby and by Mr Colin Gracie. We have heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition a series of questions which illustrate only one thing: his ignorance of the operation of the new taxation system. A series of questions have been asked. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition not only of the contents of the statements that have been made by the Minister for Small Business and the statements that have been made by Lynton Crosby; I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that, on Sunday, I announced after consultation with Senator Herron, the President of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party, that there would be a full audit by the tax office into the GST compliance by the Queensland division.I take this opportunity to confirm an understanding I had from a response by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday that, strangely, did not appear in Hansard - that is, the Leader of the Opposition's response -  that the Leader of the Opposition is happy to have an audit of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. - He said that yesterday. I hope Hansard have made a note of it. - Have you written to the tax office authorising it yet? Eh? No, we have not done that! No doubt you will get around to it. Or maybe the caucus briefer will do it on your behalf. - I thought he had a point of order. - The short answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question was contained in the first answer that I gave. I did not accept the description of `scam'. If a scam does not exist, there is nothing to close down. But I did take the opportunity of outlining the transparent way in which the Liberal Party organisation has dealt with this matter. I remind the House again that the shortfall as a result of the events that have been canvassed in the minister's statement -  the shortfall in the case of the Groom FEC -  was $76. That amount has been accounted for in a subsequent business activity statement. The shortfall in the entirety of the Queensland division, according to the statement released yesterday by Lynton Crosby, the federal director of the party, is the grand sum of $180. The sum of $180 represents the totality of this alleged scam. That is $180 that has occupied the time of the man who would be Treasurer of this country. In the process, we have had demonstrated to us a pathetic misunderstanding of the operation of the taxation laws. - On top of that, in the interests of not only the reality of transparency but also -  - the appearance of transparency, we have said that we will have a total audit of the affairs of the Queensland division of the party insofar as they relate to the operation of the goods and services tax legislation. - I think that is complete openness; I think that is complete transparency. The preoccupation, particularly of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, with this issue over the past few days is indicative of the policy bankruptcy of an opposition only a matter of several months out from an important general election.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question, and I thank her for her strong support for the workers and job seekers in her electorate and surrounding areas. I can tell the House that since March 1996 unemployment in Queensland has dropped from 8.7 per cent to 8.1 per cent. In March 1996 unemployment in Queensland was about the national average. I am afraid to say that now Queensland has the highest unemployment of any mainland state because of the industrial relations roll-back practised by the Beattie government. The Beattie government's workplace relations legislation allows strike pay, it virtually abolishes Queensland's workplace agreements, it stops award simplification, it abolishes the Queensland Employment Advocate, it removes the exemption from the unfair dismissal provisions for small business and it allows the Queensland Industrial Commission to declare contractors to be employees.Mr Speaker, what would you expect from a government completely under the thumb of the Australian Workers Union, which last year gave the Labor Party no less than $653,000 - a classic case of cash for policy. This is just a foretaste of the kind of industrial relations roll-back that Australia would experience if the Leader of the Opposition were ever to form a government. The Leader of the Opposition would actually go further than Premier Beattie. He would force Australia's one million small businesses to enter compulsory union bargaining, which would mean that, every time there is a knock on the door of small business, it could be the union heavies demanding their right of entry and chorusing, `Have we got a good-faith bargain for you.' The Queensland experience proves that roll-back costs jobs. While the Queensland government is punishing small business, the Howard government is getting on with providing job seekers in Queensland with the world's best employment services. In the electorate of Dickson, for instance, this government has put in place some 44 Work for the Dole projects over last the three years, which have provided viable work experience to nearly 2,000 young Queenslanders. When members opposite were in power, there were just two CES offices in the electorate of Dickson; now Job Network sites are in double figures. But what would the member for Dickson know, because she is the ultimate absentee political landlord. From the deck of the Gold Coast high-rise where she lives -  - Oh, it is not true, is it? She says that it is not true. - I am sorry, Mr Speaker. From the deck of the Gold Coast high-rise -  - I am simply pointing out -  - that, from the deck of a high-rise on the Gold Coast, you can just about see Dickson on a good day! - I have been asked about what the Howard government is doing to help boost employment in Queensland, and we are doing a lot more than the member for Dickson, who does not live in her electorate and who has never lived in her electorate. Last year she even said that she was about to live in the Gold Coast. - Let me simply conclude that, unlike the Queensland Labor government, we are interested in producing more jobs for Queenslanders, and the last thing that Queenslanders need is industrial relations roll-back.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no, I have not seen that report in the Courier Mail. To be perfectly honest, I have been occupied on other things this morning that have prevented me from reading in detail all the newspaper reports about this particular matter. I have attended numerous fundraisers in Queensland and I have got to say that I am always proud to go to a fundraiser in the seat of Leichhardt because if ever a person identifies with his electorate and lives amongst, and works for, his people it is the member for Leichhardt. I am absolutely proud, as indeed I am to go to fundraisers for any of my magnificent colleagues. As to the details of individual fundraisers, I do not know what those arrangements are any more than I suspect you do. - Mr Speaker, I don't think the word `scam' does anything to enhance the dignity of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and I acknowledge his great interest in the expansion of opportunities for young people in the electorate of Herbert to attend university. The government has taken the view that it is very important for the future of Australia that there be growing opportunities for young Australians to lift their level of knowledge and skills, and this has been a quite dramatic contrast with the attitude taken by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the minister. We remember his view that, at that time, the Australian universities were big enough; there were enough places in Australian universities. As he told the Age in February 1992:The desperation to get into higher education is really misplaced.Indeed, the Australian reported in February of that year:Mr Beazley said that Australia had `unquestionably reached a point' where people's expectations about entering university had to change. `You cannot provide universal higher education,' he said.In November of that year, he further emphasised his view that there was no need for further places in Australian universities. He said, `We are approaching the limit of our capacity to continue to expand publicly funded university places.' This is a view that has never been accepted by this government. It has been our view that young Australians with proper qualifications are entitled to attend university and to get university training. Since 1996, the total number of student places has increased, to this year, by 28,000 places. On Friday, I announced the universities where 2,670 extra students will begin their studies next year, with the allocation of an additional 2,000 new places each year in maths, science and information technology, which are vital for Australia's innovation, and a further 670 places each year at campuses in booming regional areas. Those additional new places each year will produce some 20,800 additional places in Australia's universities over the next four years. Regional Australia received more than half the places, enabling almost 1,485 additional places to be made available next year at regional campuses. I am sure that the member for Herbert will be particularly pleased that James Cook University received an additional 100 places for integrated bachelor programs in information technology and e-business and a further 25 places for other courses. Australian universities are now projecting that total university places will reach some 599,000 equivalent full-time places by 2003, which is a 30.5 per cent increase on enrolments since 1995.The fundamental difference has been that we were not prepared to take the view of the Leader of the Opposition that Australian universities were large enough and that there was no further need for additional university places. Our view is that Australia's comparative advantage in the world depends on having a highly skilled and highly qualified work force. Like some latter-day Atlantis, the noodle nation has sunk beneath the waves - it has vanished! - Well, say something about it! - The Leader of the Opposition says, `You wish.' Not a single reference has been made to noodle nation or knowledge nation by the Leader of the Opposition since he launched it. It has just vanished in this House - disappeared beneath the waves. It has evanesced entirely, even though he committed himself and spent every working day trying to implement it. We have not seen a working minute in question time in this House devoted to it. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he has no consistency, he has no reliability, and he will say anything in his efforts to win office. The trouble for him this time around is that the Australian people know him too well.</DOC>

 - The contact on this particular issue with the Indonesian government has not been head of government to head of the government; it has been officials. The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question and I am very happy to indicate that contact has not been at that level. The president at this stage has been travelling in South-East Asia. We have a number of contacts at different levels under way and one of the approaches will involve head of government to head of government.But I should indicate that the broader question, not related to the Tampa, of the refugee flow was raised by me in my discussions with the Indonesian government when I was in Jakarta. I thought the leader's question related specifically to the Tampa. I would point out in relation to the Tampa at other levels in relation to the broader issue I did raise that, and it is not going to be a quick process. The Indonesian government has stretched resources. We are going to continue to engage them in different ways and there will be further head of government to head of government contact. We have had some contact at senior officials level; we have also had, I understand, some contact at a foreign minister to foreign minister level and that will continue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question and her obvious concern and interest in this matter. Like the Prime Minister, I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's comments today but particularly his affirmation that the legal position is clear. I want to address some comments, if I may, to what has sometimes been asserted as the moral position as distinct from the legal position, because Australia has consistently maintained that it stands ready and willing to provide humanitarian assistance in the form of food, water, medical services and supplies, as well as the safety equipment necessary. There is one other matter that I wanted to address today, and that is the suggestions that have been made from time to time that Christmas Island is an appropriate place for people rescued at sea on a vessel of the size of Tampa to be taken. I do not know that it is recognised internationally, particularly from some of the comments I have heard, that Christmas Island does not have a port. It has a wharf and a berth to land small vessels. Captain Philpott, who was the former master of vessels for the British Phosphate Trading Christmas Island operation, had this to say, and I think it was something that ought to have been noted and observed:There are moorings at the island for bulk carriers for loading phosphate. I am familiar with the vessel Tampa, which is the huge container vessel which I believe could exceed the capacity of the moorings, both in tonnage and length. And the other problem is the very high free board of the vessel, which makes it very difficult to disembark to vessels which are not actually alongside a wharf.The captain went on to say that the likelihood of the boat, the Tampa, ripping out the moorings was such that it would leave Christmas Island unviable as a port for a long period of time if that were to occur. If you were cognisant of the issues relating to the 1,500 people whose home is at Christmas Island, that is obviously a matter of very real concern.There has been some other questioning in relation to the efforts that Australia is making to deal at source with the problem of illegal trafficking and movement of individuals. As part of a global approach to combating people-smuggling, Australia has been pursuing a range of strategies. One of the strategies has been to establish regional cooperation models with transit countries dealing with the flow of unauthorised arrivals through their territories. These issues are just as important to those countries as they are to Australia, and the more attractive that Australia is as a source, for the reasons that I outlined yesterday, the more people will inevitably end up not only in Australia but in countries of transit. So it is just as important for them to be cognisant of these issues as it is for us.Under this model, persons detected by local authorities to be travelling illegally to countries like Australia can have their claims for asylum determined there. Persons with refugee claims can apply to the local UNHCR office for protection, and, conversely, those persons found not to be refugees are offered assistance by the International Organisation for Migration to return home. The fact is that Indonesia has already interdicted some 1,500 or so people, whom it presently detains. Amongst those, a number of people have been found to be refugees. As I mentioned, 14 per cent of Afghanis have been found to be refugees, assessed by the UNHCR in Indonesia. Resettlement places are being sought internationally for those people. Already the IOM has been able to return 160 non-refugees who have volunteered for repatriation from Indonesia under these arrangements. But in July Cambodian authorities intercepted 242 people illegally attempting to come to Australia on an unseaworthy boat. The organisers of that failed trip are now in custody and I believe in Cambodia there may have been convictions for people-smuggling against a number of them.The fact is that many of the 242 passengers held false Afghan passports which they would have destroyed before arrival, if they had come to Australia, in order to hide their identities. They said that they would have claimed to be Afghans on arrival in Australia, but so far half of the boat have now admitted, or been determined, to be Pakistani in citizenship and not Afghan, and 124 people have so far volunteered to be, and have been, returned home, mostly to Pakistan, under IOM arrangements.Australia continues to support regional authorities in their efforts to contain this insidious trade. We are expanding the number of countries with whom we are formalising exchange of information about people-smuggling and other aspects of illegal immigration. We are working closely with other government agencies and with joint exercises involving the Australian Federal Police, as well as with my department, as part of a smuggling strike team to combat activities, both domestically and overseas. Another important part of our strategy has been the removal of unauthorised arrivals who have no legal right to remain in Australia. As you may have observed yesterday, I announced that a charter flight took 31 people abroad last weekend. A number of them were people of Palestinian ancestry who had come from Syria, where they already had safe and legal entitlements to continue to reside. We have also been working with international agencies in countries of first asylum and source countries, and we do so particularly through the UNHCR. Australia is committed to reinforcing those efforts and will be very much involved in developing plans with international agencies and the UNHCR to strengthen their efforts in places like Pakistan and Iran, and, when appropriate arrangements have been put together with those agencies, we will be providing additional support that will meaningfully address the issues, particularly in relation to Afghans, by committing up to an additional $14 million to assist in efforts to contain those secondary flows, and to assist in the return of displaced people from refugee camps. If those arrangements can be concluded as planned - and the enormity of this commitment ought to be understood - it will be an effective doubling of the resources made available by Australia to deal with these issues at source. No-one should see Australia as lacking in sensitivity to these issues and as unwilling to play its part in dealing with these issues constructively and positively. If all members note and bring those efforts to people's attention, a lot of the public discussion will be much more sensible and responsible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question, for the interest he shows in these issues and for the great interest he shows in international relations generally. As the Prime Minister has said, over the course of the last 48 hours or so we have had pretty intensive consultations with different levels of the Indonesian government and those consultations are continuing in Jakarta today in relation to MV Tampa. I also hope to be able to speak with the Indonesian foreign minister during this evening. He was overseas until yesterday afternoon. As the Prime Minister said, the President has been making a trip around various countries of South-East Asia. Over a period of time, though, this government has actively sought the cooperation of the Indonesian government on the broader issue of people-smuggling. We entered into a partnership with Indonesia, the International Organisation for Migration, known as the IOM, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees under what is called a regional cooperation arrangement. That regional cooperation arrangement began in April 2000. Under the arrangement, Australia funds the reasonable costs of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the IOM in their work to resolve the situation of third country nationals detained by Indonesian authorities. In that context, Australia has also been working for some time on a bilateral basis with Indonesia to assist both the Indonesian police and their immigration authorities in addressing this question. Australia is seeking to conclude with Indonesia a memorandum of understanding on illegal migration, on top of those measures that we have already entered into with Indonesia. The MOU will commit the two countries to further cooperative activities to prevent irregular people movements as best we can, and obviously as best we can to prevent people-smuggling. My colleague the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs had useful discussions in, I think, June last year on this issue. We will continue those negotiations with the Indonesians over the next few weeks. As the Prime Minister said, it was also one of the major items on the agenda for his discussions with President Megawati a couple of weeks ago. Nobody has any illusions about how difficult this trade is to deal with, and there are many different aspects to it which impact on Indonesian society in one way or another. There is great sensitivity in Indonesia about the number of illegal immigrants from other countries in South-East Asia and other parts of the world. There is no doubt that it is a trade, if you could call it that, that the Indonesians would very much like to control, but it is extremely difficult for the central government in Jakarta to do that. Nevertheless, we have had very positive and cooperative discussions with the Indonesians on this issue. We put in place the regional cooperation arrangement, which came into force in April 2000. We continue to build that aspect of the relationship with Indonesia, and that has been highlighted very much by the discussions we have had in the last couple of days over the issue of the MV Tampa.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is just the faintest whiff of a policy position in there, which is always a surprise, I have to say, from the member for Batman -  -  - It is only the very faintest whiff. We might even say something about that during the day. I might feel a bit tempted to make some observations. The reality is that, one way or another, we have done an extremely good job in addressing the telecommunications needs of rural and regional Australia. The first point that I come to is that we significantly upgraded the universal service obligation, but perhaps more important than that, and greatly to the credit of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, we have introduced something called CSG - customer service guarantee. The ALP never likes talking about that because it is, I suspect, more than anything else the mechanism that is ensuring that rural customers across the nation get the services they need. For the first time, it actually sets out what service standards might be and it raises the spectre of genuine penalties if they are not met. When you couple the processes of the universal service obligation with the CSG and with the social bonus programs such as Networking the Nation and what have you, which have to be seen as part and parcel of the several billion a year that the government has been averaging in expenditures in rural and regional Australia, they amount to a very genuine, far-reaching commitment to rural and regional Australia. Our record stands in very stark contrast to yours. You would have us believe that you had some sort of commitment to rural telecommunications services. You did not have a commitment to it - there wasn't one. There was no CSG and there was no Networking the Nation. The question can only be described as pretty flippant. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. I can inform the House that the June quarter current account deficit was $3½ billion, or 2.1 per cent of GDP. This is the lowest current account deficit as a proportion of GDP for 21 years. The fall in the current account deficit was led by a surplus in trade on goods and services, a surplus of $1.5 billion for the quarter, the largest surplus since the gold sales back in 1997. Abstracting from those gold sales, it is the largest quarterly trade surplus in nominal terms since 1959. The current account deficit was led by a rise in export volumes of 1.1 per cent and a 0.2 per cent decrease in import volumes. I pay tribute to Australia's farmers and rural producers. In the March quarter, the volume of rural exports rose by a full four per cent, and over the year by 0.7 per cent. For the financial year - that is, the whole of the year ended June 2001 - the current account deficit was 2.8 per cent of GDP, the lowest current account deficit in 21 years. As members would know, since the election of Labor in 1983 and Mr Keating's comments about a banana republic in 1986, Australia's current account deficit has been averaging above four per cent. These figures, led by Australia's exports, have -  - I am asked by the Labor Party about foreign debt. I can inform the Labor Party that foreign debt in the June quarter fell -  - It fell by two per cent of GDP, from 48.8 per cent to 46.7 per cent, with the export servicing ratio - this is the proportion of exports which is required to service net foreign debt - falling to 9.2 per cent off a high of 20 per cent back in 1990. So the export story for Australia, notwithstanding a weakening world economy, is a good export story. It has no doubt been helped by a competitive exchange rate, and I have mentioned that on numbers of occasions. But, in addition to that, for the first time ever in Australian history, Australian exporters got the same deal as exporters from other countries got: they could export tax free, because this government changed the taxation system.Labor's system was to tax our exporters and to weight them down with taxes in a way which no other country was doing. With the advent of tax reform, Australian exporters got the same opportunities as exporters from other countries. They have led growth in this particular quarter, notwithstanding a weaker world economy. As a result, Australia's current account is the lowest in 21 years; and in relation to trade in goods and services there is a surplus in the quarter. I pay tribute to the exporters of Australia, particularly our rural producers, for the magnificent performance that they have put in during a weakening world environment.</DOC>

 - Yes, I can explain why the home of St Catherine's of Siena is to close. - It has decided to close -  -  - Yes, it has decided that it wishes to close. - The St Catherine's of Siena home is one of nine homes owned by the trustees of the Roman Catholic Church of Maitland and Newcastle. It has appointed Catholic Care of the Aged as the manager of those nine businesses. It has made a business decision to close St Catherine's because it is an old heritage building, a former convent -  - It is a business decision because it is an old heritage building which Catholic Care of the Aged has apparently decided is no longer financially rewarding in terms of making that management of nine businesses profitable. If I can address the question of subsidy, St Catherine's of Siena has had, since 1995-96, an increase of 54 per cent in funding: it has risen from $1.638 million to $2.7 million. It in addition sought in 1997 -  - It sought an increase of 16 beds, which it told the department would make it more viable. It also received a capital grant at that time in order to do some upgrading of that old heritage building, which I understand is the former convent and really totally unsuitable for an aged care home. Further, if you have a look at the consolidated accounts of Catholic Care of the Aged, you will see that that group received, in this current financial year, $15 million. That is $15 million which has been received to run the homes it manages, plus the community aged care packages. And, if you look at their profit and loss account, you will see that they trade at a profit. But they have made a decision that this particular home is no longer one they wish to operate. They have sought advice from the department, which has made suggestions about the way they might share a kitchen between the high-level care and the low-level care which is on the same site and about whether or not they might seek extra service, but they have declined to follow those recommendations.The fact of the matter is that they have made a business decision to close this home but to keep the 67 beds, because they will be able to keep the 67 beds, receive the same amount of subsidy and not have to service an expensive building. They will also be able to move the residents who are in that home into other homes that they operate. In fact, they will not be permitted, not be prepared, to transfer any of the beds out of the Hunter because those beds are required to be in the Hunter and therefore they may not sell them without permission of the department, and permission would not be given if they were chosen to be sold outside the region.I further add that, within the period from the end of 1998 to 1 November 2001, some 461 places will have come on stream in the Hunter, to improve the legacy that was left behind by the Labor Party, who refused to issue new places whilst they were in office. I think it would be useful for me to table details of the new homes that have in fact been opened. I can say that they do indeed include high-care beds and new homes, as well as extensive renovations to existing homes. I table the document for members who are interested in aged care in Newcastle. I point out that the way the system works in aged care is that the government provides funding to approved providers who, at the time they apply for beds, must prove that they are financially viable. In fact, Catholic Care of the Aged have always managed to do that, but they are entitled to make this business decision - though I would say that the approved provider is the trustees of the Catholic Church itself and in the end it is the trustees who must make the decision to close, although they will probably accept the recommendation of their managers, Catholic Care of the Aged. I might add that Catholic Care of the Aged also manage another two homes on behalf of the Sisters of St Joseph, and they have chosen to remove some of those beds from Lochinvar -  - I mentioned also that Catholic Care of the Aged manages a home at Lochinvar on behalf of the Sisters of St Joseph. They have chosen to move those beds - 20 beds which are operational and 10 which have been given provisional approval - to a new site that they already operate at Swansea, where the 10 beds that have been given a provisional allocation will be able to be brought on stream more quickly. This is a sensible outcome. I understand that the sisters are in discussion with an alternate manager in order that they may have that facility managed by a different entity.I raise that second point for the very sensible reason that there has been movement in the Hunter whereby Catholic Care of the Aged has made a business decision that one out of nine homes should close, that they will continue to operate the other eight homes and that they will continue to receive the same subsidy by absorbing the 67 beds into their existing facilities, without the inappropriate heritage building, which is not a suitable building for an aged care home. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his very real interest in these matters. The government has established a very impressive record in fostering regional development. In fact, when you total it, we have committed some $28½ billion over five years in specific programs supporting regional Australia. There are some 300 of them, believe it or not. When you range across from the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Control, Roads for Recovery, the Regional Solutions Program, the rural transactions centres, More Doctors Better Services, and Agriculture -  Advancing Australia, it is a very impressive list. We have overseen a quiet revolution in the way that we do business with rural and regional communities. We do it in partnership. We do not come along now with a plan out of Canberra and say, `This is what you will wear whether you like it or not because Canberra knows best.' We have an open toolbox approach: we have a range of programs that rural communities can access. It works very well and rural communities appreciate it very much. It is about reconnecting rural and regional Australia, bridging the divide to ensure that they recognise that, at a time of increasing prosperity and opportunity in this country, undergirded by economic reform under this government, rural and regional Australia are not left behind.The Stronger Regions Program announced today is another significant step forward in the journey that we are taking towards a completely revitalised  and strong rural and regional Australia. The centrepiece of it is the $100 million Sustainable Regions Program to help local leaders and local communities meet the challenge of change. To be honest, it is something that I do not think we have always managed as well as we might have. The ALP committed us to trade reform in the early 1990s. It was supported by farm leaders and, certainly, it was supported widely across the range. But, frankly, not enough thought was put into how we would cope and help those communities that were going to wear the brunt of change. Today we have taken a very significant further step to ensure that communities that are experiencing very high unemployment, low levels of household income, a lack of investment and lack of job opportunities in rural, regional and remote Australia and outer metropolitan areas have a more effective mechanism to ensure that their problems are addressed.I also announce that, from November this year, the federal government will pick up the bill for 40 per cent of Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service charges across agricultural industries. This is an area where the ALP could never get it right. They moved from 100 per cent payment by the government to 100 per cent payment by industry, with a system that was out of control and that was loaded with surplus inspectors who were then billed to people who were paying for the services. At one stage, I think, it rose to a total cost, to an industry much smaller than it is today, of about $120 million. Ministers like Kerin and the would-be Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, the member for Hotham, were utterly unable to reform it. We have brought the costs down through reform, and today I have announced that there will be a further reduction of 40 per cent from November this year. I have also indicated that we will be ensuring that national competition policy works to the advantage of rural and regional Australian communities. I was also asked about alternative policies. There has been the whiff of a policy - a couple actually - from the member for Batman. The whiff came in a graph - they do love graphs! We got a graph put out on regional development funding: `The official story', they call it. I suppose members cannot quite see it here but we love these Labor graphs -  it is just a pity that they cannot be more accurate. The whiff of policy is that they want to take us back, presumably, to when they did a lot on regional development. I have just outlined policies from this side of the House for rural and regional Australia which come to between $5 billion and $6 billion a year. Labor has a graph out saying that they were spending - wait for it! - $200 million a year on regional development, and their graph shows that, under those programs, it dropped away to virtually nothing under us, so they claim that we ought to go back to their way of doing things: $200 million a year. In contrast, there is close to $6 billion a year under the way in which the Liberal and National Party governments have approached regional development. The real pity of all this is that what we have had is a clear demonstration that my opposite number, the ALP spokesman for regional development, is still lost in that land where he believes that Canberra knows best: that regional development is all about having some committees and some bureaucrats who will do a little bit of talking but will not actually work in partnership with the great regions of this nation, where seven million Australians live, to ensure that they grasp a strong and secure future. </DOC>

 - The answer is no, I have not seen the report. It was released today and I thought it would have been obvious that I have not had an opportunity to read a report of that kind, given other matters that I have been giving some attention to this morning. I always pay some regard - indeed, a great deal of regard - to what the Salvation Army says. I think it is a wonderful organisation, and I cannot think of a finer organisation in this country. It brings to the care of the needy in the Australian community not only Christian compassion but also a hard-headed assessment of human behaviour. - I guess in all of these things there are some things we agree with from organisations and there are some things we do not agree with. I would be interested to know whether the honourable member for Grayndler agrees with the views of the Salvation Army on heroin trials, for example. I would be very interested to know that. I say very genuinely to the member for Grayndler that I will have a look at the Salvation Army report. If there is anything further I can say on it, I will. As of now I have not seen it for the most obvious of reasons, but I will have a look at it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. It comes on a particularly significant day for agricultural Australia - we had the great news about our wonderful trade performance and the contribution that rural and regional Australia has made to the best trade statistics since 1959. That is a real credit to the tremendous effort that people in the electorate of the honourable member, and indeed others, are making towards developing a very strong export focus for our nation. Earlier today the Deputy Prime Minister delivered his landmark Stronger Regions, A Stronger Australia statement, which is a real blueprint for the future progress and development of people who live in regional Australia. I take the opportunity to congratulate him on a very forthright and visionary statement. There are a number of very significant issues to help particularly those areas of rural and regional Australia that are still doing it tough and that have not yet had an opportunity to share in the broader prosperity and development of our nation. Those things will certainly be welcomed in electorates like my own and, I am sure, the electorate of New England. One of the particularly welcome announcements was the decision to reduce AQIS inspection charges by 40 per cent across the board. This is a magnificent initiative, something that has been demanded by the exporting sector ever since the days when Labor introduced full cost recovery in 1991. This is consistent with this government's efforts in reducing costs and taxes on exporters. We have, after all, taken through the new tax system around $3.5 billion off the costs of our exporters.If we are looking around for any single factor that has contributed to the great trade statistics reported today, it certainly has to be the reform of the tax system. Not only are we taking positive steps in this regard to introduce new measures; we are reversing many of the negative elements of the policy mix that were put in place by Labor - whether it is reforming the waterfront or reforming the costs of AQIS. AQIS costs went up year by year under Labor. As the Deputy Prime Minister remarked, under the direction of the ex-ACTU president who was in charge of quarantine policy at the time the costs simply blew out because no-one was prepared to take on the unions. No-one was prepared to do anything about costs that were just redundant in the whole system.There were actually scores of meat inspectors in towns where there were not even any meatworks. Labor did not have the guts to shift them. The union said, `No, they will stay there and enjoy a life of luxury and ease.' They were not prepared to move people to places where the work was, and so there were something like 800 meat inspectors around the country. Now that number has been halved because we have them where they are doing the work. On top of all that, there is going to be a significant reduction in the costs that will be applied. It will apply not just to the meat industry - although that is the biggest cost of the inspection charges - but also to grain, dairy, live animals, fish, horticulture and organic foods. They will all enjoy lower cost impositions on their exports. That will help our people, who have to work in anything but a level playing field, to achieve a satisfactory export performance for our nation.Mr Speaker, it may not surprise you to know that this announcement has been very warmly welcomed by Australian exporters. Livecorp: `Industry applauds reduction in AQIS charges', and of course that will be across the board. What about the Cattle Council? `Beef producers over the moon on $20 million saving.' What a difference it makes to have a government that cares about exporters, that wants to do something about building a strong rural and regional Australia, that actually helps our exporters rather than hindering them. That can only happen when you have a coalition government.</DOC>

 - I have three points to make. The first is that I have not read the report - for the most obvious of reasons -  but I will.  - I have not even read that extensively today, either. With all due charity to the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Grayndler, I will not accept uncritically their regurgitation of what is in the report without having a look myself. The second point is that I do not accept the Leader of the Opposition's characterisation of behaviour by the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. In conjunction with that, I would point out to him that we are perfectly happy to throw the books of the Queensland division of the Liberal Party open for examination in relation to GST matters. I assume the Leader of the Opposition has already written that letter, or he has arranged for the president of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party to write that letter, to the Commissioner of Taxation. -  - Oh, it hasn't gone yet! I know: I am meant to have read the Salvation Army report this morning, but he has not had time to write to the tax commissioner! As to the rest of it, I will take the question on notice and, when I have read the report written by the Salvation Army - and I repeat that I have the greatest possible regard for the Salvation Army; it is a wonderful organisation - I might have something further to say.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Deputy Prime Minister has already outlined in question time the actions the government is taking broadly, in the Stronger Regions statement and in a number of very specific statements. But I would like to inform honourable members of one specific thing we are doing in the area of health relating to the operation of the Trade Practices Act. The Trade Practices Act has caused concern across all general practitioner groups - from the college of GPs, the College of Rural and Remote Medicine, the Rural Doctors Association, through to the AMA.Different groups have different concerns about the operations, and there would appear to be some genuine concerns. Certainly the issue of rostering in country areas and the issue of practice structure, where one doctor might be incorporated and another doctor not incorporated, would appear to be problems. To be fair to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, they acknowledge this and they have been very supportive of the authorisation process that the government intends to proceed with in looking at these two issues. In spite of that, other concerns have been put up, and it is hard from a position of government to determine the validity of these concerns. They may very well have substance. So the Prime Minister has announced today that the government will be having an inquiry into the operation of the Trade Practices Act, inasmuch as it affects rural and remote communities attracting and retaining doctors. The three people who will be looking at this are Warwick Wilkinson, who is an assistant commissioner with the ACCC and who, in 1999, looked at the national competition review of pharmacy; Diana Gibbs, an economic consultant working in rural Australia; and Dr John Aloizos, currently chairman of the Australian Pharmacy Advisory Committee and past chairman of the Australian Divisions of General Practice. The terms of reference ask them to look at the impact of the Trade Practices Act on the competitiveness, structure, sustainability and regulation of medical practitioners in rural Australia; the economic and social impacts of rural medical practitioners and the communities they serve; changes to market structure, competitiveness and sustainability of regulation of medical practice in recent years; public benefits, if any, from the altering of the application of the Trade Practices Act to rural medical practitioners; measures which could be undertaken to facilitate the flow of benefits or mitigate any transitional costs or negative impacts arising from the application of the Trade Practices Act to rural medical practitioners and residents of rural and remote Australia; and measures to create greater awareness of the Trade Practices Act and the medical profession in the community. This will give a chance for those people who have concerns about the operation of the Trade Practices Act to raise them in an open and public manner. The committee will hold public hearings. We expect to have a report from them within six months, and if that report shows, in its independent and open way, that there are problems over and above those which we have already identified, we are prepared to act on them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. There are a number of things I would like to say in reply to that. The member for Kennedy represents one of those electorates which, along with the electorates represented by the member for Kalgoorlie, the member for O'Connor, the member for Grey, the member for Leichhardt, the member for Maranoa - most of them are over here.An opposition member - The Northern Territory! - I acknowledge the Northern Territory electorate, which is represented by the other side. I do acknowledge that. The electorates that I have mentioned have the characteristics of very considerable size and remoteness from population centres, and it is true that some of the costs in those electorates are higher than costs in metropolitan areas. It is an undeniable fact, and I would not seek to argue against it, but I would also submit that there are some other features of the cost structures around Australia where the reverse is the case. It is undeniably the case that housing costs in a city like Sydney are dramatically higher than they are in any other part of Australia and infinitely higher than they are in rural and regional Australia. It is always important, with these things, to bring a sense of balance and perspective.There are a number of things that I would specifically say in reply to the member for Kennedy. The first thing I think I will do is to send him a copy of the Deputy Prime Minister's speech, made to the National Press Club today. I thought it was an excellent speech.  - One of the things that really hit me in the eye about the Deputy Prime Minister's speech was the statement contained in an earlier part of the speech in which he said that, over the past five years, the government has invested $28.5 billion in more than 300 regional programs. He then set out that record in a companion document. He also announced today a 40 per cent reduction in AQIS charges. I would hope that the member for Kennedy would acknowledge that that will assist many industries in his own electorate. - I think it will. He does agree. That is good; I am pleased to hear it. It is true that 20 years ago, when I was Treasurer, I did have an inquiry carried out into zone rebates. That is true. That inquiry was fairly inconclusive, and it is true that there have been discussions within the government parties. I know that when the member for Kennedy sat with us he was involved in some of those discussions. I was sympathetic to those discussions taking place, but the view was formed as a result of those discussions that many of the complexities, including the aggregate costs surrounding a significant expansion of the zone rebate structure to bring meaningful relief, outweighed the advantages that would accrue as a result of that. The government therefore has taken the view that there are other and better ways of assisting remote communities. One of the ways is to have a good export sector. Another way, may I say, is to have a supercompetitive exchange rate. I cannot think of any single development in the Australian economy that has been of more assistance to electorates like Kennedy, Gwydir, Maranoa and Grey and all of those - the member for Kennedy, I note, nods his head - than this supercompetitive exchange rate.  - The Treasurer quite promptly reminded me of the enormous benefits that have accrued through lower interest rates - and lower inflation, lower taxation and taking the GST off exports. The member for Kennedy is nodding at everything. I think I am making some progress with the member for Kennedy; I really do. I do understand the commitment of the member for Kennedy to rural Australia. We might disagree, and we are adult enough to recognise that we do disagree on some things, but there are a lot of things where the views that we hold on the approaches that ought to be taken are similar.I know that the member for Kennedy supports lower taxation, lower interest rates, lower fuel costs, no taxation on exports and a supercompetitive exchange rate. And I bet he loves the fact that we now have a superefficient waterfront in Australia as a result of the strong action that I have taken. This is not a question without notice; it's almost a policy love-in. I say to the member for Kennedy that I will always remain sensitive and sympathetic to the concerns and needs of the wonderful people of Kennedy. In relation to zone rebates, I think there are better ways, but I would be happy to further discuss the matter with the member for Kennedy if he would like to take advantage of that offer.</DOC>

 - The government acknowledge the very great importance of regional communities having access to air services. No-one could deny that, in relation to the debate around Sydney's future airport needs, we have demonstrated a very real commitment in policy terms and, I think it can be fairly said, in financial terms. Regional airlines carry more than 5.6 million passengers per year. There are essential transport links for the millions of Australians who live outside our capital cities. In particular, it needs to be remembered that emergency services such as the air ambulance and the Royal Flying Doctor Service are an essential part of life in the remote areas of Australia. I said a little while ago that we caught just a whiff - just the merest whiff -  of a policy for rural and regional Australia from the member for Batman. - Actually, you could say three that I am aware of. We hear some talk about an infrastructure council of some sort - to spend I do not know what, because they have made no commitment to our programs let alone to any of their own. In addition to that, we have seen some suggestions that we ought to go back to their regional development policy of spending a mere $200 million a year. But they now have another one. We have said that we will retain Essendon airport in Victoria as an operational airport. It has been privatised, it has been sold off; we have been through that process. The Minister for Finance and Administration has done a tremendous job in identifying an appropriate owner, and all that has been handled well. It was great news for regional Victoria that we would retain it as an operational airport, because it handles 18,000 country movements a year. It also, as part of that, handles 8,000 flights per year by the air ambulance and the police air arm.   - That is a very good question. Astonishingly, we now have a policy from the Labor Party spokesman for regional development. It is one of the few policies that have been announced by that `great friend of the bush', the member for Batman. He has announced that Labor would close Essendon airport. Under Labor's plan, air ambulance services would have to move further away from the city to Melbourne airport. I have here a letter from the Victorian Metropolitan Ambulance Service, and I am happy to table it. It says:I would like to stress that from an air ambulance point of view Essendon airport is ideally located, being on the edge of a freeway and within 10 minutes of major city hospitals. - A bit of personal abuse is always a good substitute for a policy statement. That is really where the ACTU Tammany Hall style practices come into evidence in this place. We have got just the whiff of three opposition policies, and this is one of them. Mr Speaker, let me again give you some background, because I think it is important. We went to a lot of trouble to make sure - and I thank the minister for finance for recognising this in our negotiations - that Essendon airport would be available not just for the convenience but for the safety, the health and the wellbeing of country Victorians. We went to a lot of trouble to ensure that. Along comes their `friend of the bush' with the only policy statement of any substance we have seen for a very long time and it is so city-centric that every regional Victorian ought to be loudly and clearly made aware of it. We have waited months and months for a policy statement from the member for Batman. At last he has revealed part of it, and it is basically this: if you live in regional Australia -  - They always protest loudly when they do not want to hear the punchline, and the punchline is that their policy prescription is: if you live in regional Australia, you are less important than someone who lives in a major city. The coalition roundly rejects that proposition.</DOC>

 - I think that it is worth while just recapitulating the sequence of events which occurred, because with an issue like this some of the facts in the sequence in which events unfolded can be lost sight of. On Sunday, 26 August a Norwegian registered vessel, Tampa, which was travelling from Fremantle to Singapore, responded to a broadcast issued by Australian Search and Rescue alerting of a vessel in distress. The Tampa diverted its course and rescued 434 prospective unauthorised arrivals in international waters from a fishing boat that had set off from Indonesia and was crewed by Indonesians. After picking them up - I stress, at the direction of the Indonesian search and rescue authorities - the MV Tampa then proceeded towards the Indonesian port of Merak where the ship had been granted approval - I repeat: the ship had been granted approval - to dock and for the group to disembark. However, under a form of duress, with some people threatening to jump overboard, the master turned the ship around and headed for Christmas Island. The Tampa stood off Christmas Island outside Australian territorial waters.The current situation is that the Tampa is still lying within Australian territorial waters. It is our view that it should return to international waters. We are in the process of providing all the necessary medical help that is needed. I take the opportunity of again reminding the House that, contrary to the advice received from the ship's master and also from the Norwegian company owning the vessel, the finding of the Australian Defence Force doctor was that there were four people suffering dehydration, some eight to 10 people with sprained ankles, and one person described as having a mild or soft fracture. The doctor said that none of them were in need of medical evacuation. He also indicated that there were adequate medical supplies on board to deal with those situations.Clearly, the requests that we give to the master of the vessel, the behaviour that we will expect of him and the action that the Australian authorities may take to bring about a certain course of action will be consistent with our legal obligations, our legal rights and, also of course, our humanitarian obligations. Beyond that, I do not propose to say anything further in answer to the question. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McEwen for her question and, for the benefit of the House, I provide some information about the present situation in terms of the survivors and the vessel. The situation on Christmas Island and on the MV Tampa is stable. The Australian Defence Force personnel remain on board but the captain is still in command of his ship and keeping it on station about four nautical miles off Flying Fish Cove. A resupply of the vessel occurred late yesterday. It was undertaken by Defence personnel and consisted of humanitarian supplies in the form of food, blankets, nappies and other personal products, and shade cover was also supplied. A further resupply was completed a short time ago consisting of further humanitarian supplies including items known as `comfort packs' which included toothbrushes, soap and the like. We do intend to deliver portaloos to the vessel. There is sufficient water on board with some 207 tonnes. The ship has a desalination facility and the doctor remains on board. There are no reports of significant medical problems, as the Prime Minister outlined in answer to the question he received from the Leader of the Opposition. The only medical treatment that the doctor has reported today was for a broken fingernail and a cut thumb. Another two C130 Hercules shuttles with general stores are scheduled to fly into Christmas Island today and Australia does remain committed to providing humanitarian assistance to all the people on the vessel.</DOC>

 - There are a number of aspects of that question which are hypothetical and I will ignore those. I do not do that in reliance on some point of procedure but rather, given the nature of the issue, I do not think that it is appropriate that I engage in hypothetical responses. Perhaps it might even be appropriate for the Leader of the Opposition not to engage in hypothetical questions. The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question, and I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, in response to your first question, I have already outlined the general intention of the government, and that position remains firm. As to what may occur after that, I can inform the Leader of the Opposition that quite a number of discussions have taken place today, and further discussions will be occurring later in the day. At this stage it is not appropriate for me to canvass the substance of those, but when it is I will hope to be in a position to talk further, initially on a confidential basis, with the Leader of the Opposition and later, if it is appropriate and I have sufficient information, I will inform the House. Obviously, this remains a very complex and difficult situation, but one unalterable fact emerges - that is, we are resolute in defending the sovereignty of this country. We are determined to have a consistent position. We did not seek this difficulty -  -  - One of the things that is emerging from this is the way in which once again the Leader of the Opposition is trying to walk both sides of the street on this issue. One minute the Leader of the Opposition is saying that he supports what the government is doing and the next minute, as he did last night, he is accusing the government of trying to engage in wedge politics. Yesterday at 2 o'clock the government is receiving the full support of the opposition; by half past six in the evening we are engaging in wedge politics. I wonder what happened to the Australian Labor Party between now and then.  -  - I think it is appropriate in the context of that to just place on record with the parliament some of the matters surrounding the legislation that was rejected by the Senate last night. During the course of that debate I put to the Leader of the Opposition, given the reservations that he had expressed about the legislation during the debate, what I thought was the eminently reasonable proposition that the legislation should have a sunset clause of six months; in other words, it would expire on a date in February 2002. That would have allowed adequate time for the public and both sides of politics to determine whether the legislation had the draconian impact claimed by the Leader of the Opposition - a draconian impact alleged by the Leader of the Opposition and predicated on an assumption that an Australian minister would behave with reckless indifference to human life. That was the whole basis of the attack.  - That was the allegation that you made. It was one of the worst allegations that I have heard made by the Leader of the Opposition. It is one thing to criticise a person's politics, but to actually say and infer that a minister of either your party or my party or the National Party would behave in a way that would endanger human life is about as reprehensible a statement as a political leader can make. It is absolutely reprehensible.We made that suggestion and the Leader of the Opposition, after consultation with his colleagues, came back and said to me, `No, that six-month sunset clause is unacceptable.' He did then say to me, recalling his words as best I can, `We would be willing to give you a Tampa specific clause. I could get a group headed up by Michael Costello to sit down and negotiate with the government about the form of that Tampa specific legislation.' I said that we believed that it was appropriate for there to be more abundant legal caution and to reinforce our legal position. I thought it was appropriate that we had the legislation in the form presented by the government. We were prepared to compromise in relation to the sunset clause, but, as he was not willing to accept that, that would appear to be the end of the matter.Recalling that conversation, I am now fascinated to pick up a resolution of the federal parliamentary Labor caucus which deals with the legislation. It says a few critical things about the legislation, essentially repeating what was said in the parliament last night. I will not weary the House with a repetition of that, but the penultimate dot point reads as follows:Noting Australia asserts the legal right to secure the vessel once it entered Australian waters without permission, Labor remains prepared to negotiate with the government on a comprehensive solution which must be based upon a safe destination being found for the vessel and the people on board to sail to, provisioning of the vessel and attending to genuine medical needs - we have no argument, of course, with the provisioning of the vessel and attending to genuine medical needs - and security for the master and the crew if that is requested.We have no particular argument with that last one. But the first one is the additional condition that emerged in our discussions last night about the safe destination being found for the vessel. What in effect that does - and anybody who thinks for a moment will know what that simply means - is to give every country an out except Australia. What fundamentally that is doing is telegraphing to the rest of the world that all you have to do is to say no.If a bill in that form were the only law on which we could rely, there would be no way that the Tampa would ever leave Australian territorial waters. Fortunately, there is other law available and, as I said last night and I say again today, it remains our legal advice that we are in a sound legal position in relation to what is being done. But it is instructive that, if we were left to the Tampa specific bill contemplated by the federal parliamentary Labor caucus, there would be an almost absolute guarantee that the Tampa would never leave Australian territorial waters. That represents a very long journey in the space of less than 24 hours from the principled position that I thought the Leader of the Opposition was taking yesterday afternoon when he supported the government's position.  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. It is a fact that the issues relating to the protection of Australia's borders are very much related to maintaining the integrity of the immigration program and also maintaining the integrity of our capacity to assist in relation to refugees, deal with asylum issues and also cope with what is in fact a very significant international problem.No country can be expected to resolve the problems of the world's refugee crises when you have as many as 23.5 million refugees and people of concern - those who have been identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees - and, beyond that, the very much larger number of people whose claims have been rejected, and the numbers of people who are in fact looking for immigration outcomes. The international protection system ultimately depends upon effective burden sharing and orderly resolution of refugee problems where they emerge. In fact, if you want to see where refugee crises have been effectively addressed and where the numbers have come down - as they have, from something in the order of 29 million four or five years ago, as I recall - it is where people are able to return home in safety and dignity, as they did in Kosovo, East Timor, with our assistance, and Rwanda. And they were the places where you saw the major reductions in the number of refugees.At an international level, Australia continues to be an active member of a number of multilateral organisations that seek solutions to problems created through the unlawful movement of people which undermines the protection regime. We have been encouraging the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to expand the number of countries that are signatories to the refugee convention. We have been working as a signatory country with those who have not yet established effective refugee status determination systems, and to do so with the assistance of the United Nations High Commissioner. I spent some time briefing officials from Mongolia fairly recently to talk about those very questions.The government has of course refocused efforts to ensure that countries of first asylum are provided with the capacity to support refugees within their borders and to prevent onward travel to other countries. We have provided something of the order of $20.8 million over four years to support a large number of displaced Afghanis and Iraqis in Iran and Pakistan to help reduce refugee outflows and to promote repatriation. I announced yesterday that we were intending, on certain conditions, to contribute a doubling of our support to that organisation, and a large part of that funding would be to supplement efforts to repatriate Afghanis out of Pakistan. As I outlined in detail to the House yesterday, we also have a regional cooperation agreement with Indonesia which aims to prevent the onward movement of illegal entrants to Australia. We have expanded the overseas compliance network to a total of 24 offices in high risk immigration locations, as well as initiating and expanding information sharing arrangements with other agencies. We have introduced legislation, which honourable members would be aware of, to substantially strengthen character provisions for the Migration Act to get quick and decisive action to deny entry and remove non-citizens of character concern.We have announced a 10-year strategy to detain those who come to Australia and to ensure that the mandatory detention regime can operate effectively. The government improved Coastwatch, Customs and Navy capabilities to detect, pursue, intercept and search boats carrying unauthorised arrivals, and $124 million was committed to this initiative over four years. Legislation was also introduced to allow the government to prosecute smugglers, to seize or destroy their boats, and crew members are now detained and prosecuted under the Migration Act for bringing people here unlawfully, with penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment and fines of $220,000. Already a number of people have been sentenced to up to seven years under that legislation.We have negotiated bilateral agreements with source and transit countries for cooperation on people smuggling issues and to provide return of unauthorised arrivals. With cooperation through a number of international agencies, Australia's internal bodies such as Quarantine, Federal Police, Coastwatch and the Attorney-General's Department, as well as my own department, are investigating people-smuggling activities both here and abroad with a view to obtaining prosecutions. It was gratifying recently that, in relation to an intended clandestine arrival to Australia, Cambodia still holds, and is prosecuting, two of the major smugglers from Indonesia who were seeking to diversify their activities into that country.I have personally engaged in a significant number of bilateral visits with source and transit countries to ensure cooperation at an international level. Let me say this very clearly: I have worked to try and get Europe to focus on the urgency of the situation in Pakistan and Iran, but not with the same degree of success. When I sought from the European Community details of action plans to deal with the problems in those countries so that we could work with them, those plans were lamentably weak in terms of their capacity and few people seemed to be focused on doing anything about it. And yet Pakistan and Iran are now seeing a reduction in the support from the international community for them to deal with the large numbers of people that they see inside their borders. I have to say that the people who are inside their borders are the people who have no prospect of joining the people smuggler route. They have no money to pay at all. They are not free enough to travel. They are the ones without identification. They have no money to pay somebody to produce fraudulent documentation to help them on their way.The fact is that the crisis that ought to be addressed is one that lamentably the international community, which is quick to offer gratuitous advice about what we should be doing, largely ignores. I find it a great personal tragedy when I see those situations. I find it lamentable when I know that the people who are coming here on boats are those who were free enough to travel. Let me say to the House what I said to the Australian people on radio today, and what I have said before: when the UNHCR was processing people in Indonesia who were claiming to be Afghani, few refugees were found. There are reasons for that. When people are travelling to Indonesia, they do not sail from Pakistan across the Indian Ocean; they fly. And nobody gets off an aircraft without a travel document. It may be fraudulent, but at least it tells you where they have come from and who they claim to be. The people who were found in Cambodia, intent on travelling to Australia as Afghanis, had documents with them, as do those in Indonesia and Malaysia. They had documents with them, and those documents disclosed that more than half of them were either Pakistani or Afghani with residency entitlements in Pakistan. When it came to a question of staying and getting safety and security which was offered to them in Cambodia, they said that they would rather go back to Pakistan and join up with the people smugglers again to see if they could get them to Australia. That is the sort of situation we are dealing with and it brings me, in part, to the legislation that I hope we will get cooperation on from the opposition. I regret very much that there seems to be an intention in another place to thwart that legislation by delaying its passage so that it cannot be dealt with within this parliament. - If that is a serious offer, I will talk to you. Let me go on. This is a problem that is far bigger than Australia. I have looked for alternative responses. I do not mean to be provocative about this, but the views I see are very narrow indeed. The opposition's answer today is a coastguard. - The coastguard would use the border protection legislation passed by this government -  -  - And supported by you, and we welcome that - some of the material you had not cherry picked. - The border protection act gave the government powers to intercept in international waters and it gave officers power to board, search and detain vessels where they suspect that people-smuggling is involved, and we have been doing this - we have been using the powers. But they have not been as effective as we would have liked, because the people-smugglers say, `Thank you very much, but we're still coming anyway.' At other times, passengers have thrown fuel and water overboard and, as others have experienced, threatened self-harm. So it is not as simple as the opposition would want us to believe. The member for Denison, at a doorstop on 23 August, said:I certainly believe that if we intercept vessels that are on their way to Australia before they arrive and land on Australian soil, then many of those vessels will turn. They will turn because the crew will be made aware that if they continue onwards they will be arrested. They will face court, they will face penalties of up to seven years imprisonment and their vessels will be destroyed.As indicated, it is yet to be proven that that legislation will work, notwithstanding the warnings that have been given, but the member for Denison went on to say:Well, I certainly believe that if there is a situation where a master and a crew of a vessel require our assistance to return to Indonesia where they come from, there is no reason why we couldn't provide it. I mean there is no necessity in those instances to say there is no alternative but to proceed to Australia.It seems to me that that is precisely the situation that we are dealing with now. We need the support and the capacities to deal with that issue, and not just that issue but the issue of the large number of people who are watching now how this issue is resolved. I have to tell the House that, notwithstanding the view that I have been prone to exaggeration on these matters, I mentioned 10,000 people on their way to Australia, and we have now had 10,000 people here. I was ridiculed for that. I have said over the last few days that there were 900 people intending to come this week, on the information that we received, and 2,000 in Indonesia. The ABC this morning tells us that, independently with their inquiries, they believe that as many as 5,000 people are in Indonesia. We know that there are people further upstream. The handling of this issue very much determines the way in which Australia will be perceived. The fact is that the information available to us is that the vessels with 900 people on them have delayed their departure to see how this issue is resolved. If these people were to enter Australia now, it would be seen as the sign for all of them to continue coming in the way in which they are. For the people involved, there is a risk, because the information we are receiving suggests that there are two vessels that, if they have not returned to Indonesia, might be overdue. The implications of that are that other lives could already have been lost. </DOC>

 - In answer to that question, I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the point at which I saw fit to contact the Prime Minister of Norway was after I had been notified that, contrary to an earlier advice, the master of the vessel proposed to defy the Australian instruction and enter our territorial seas. Until then - the foreign minister will remember the discussions we had - we thought that the appropriate point of contact, and it had taken place, was between the foreign minister of Australia and the foreign minister of Norway. - The suggestion that it is a comparable situation is not correct. The question asked by the Leader of the Opposition gives me an opportunity to rehearse to the House the contact that has occurred between -  - tell the House, if he is offended by that expression - inform the House of the contacts that have occurred on this specific issue and also the more general issue between Australia and Indonesia. I preface that by saying that it is my expectation to speak to the President of Indonesia later today. I remind the House that, when I visited Indonesia earlier this month, I raised with President Megawati the general issue of illegal migration and cooperation between Australia and Indonesia. This issue was taken up in even more detail in subsequent meetings with the Indonesian coordinating minister for political and security affairs, Mr Yudhoyono, and also the Indonesian foreign minister. Mr Downer, our foreign minister, spoke at length to his Indonesian counterpart last night, when they discussed the issue of bilateral cooperation on illegal migration. Obviously, the Tampa issue was canvassed and agreement was reached for a visit to Indonesia by Australian ministers next week.I might also point out to the House that it had been our hope that a group of officials, led by the secretary of the department of foreign affairs, Dr Ashton Calvert, would have gone to Indonesia yesterday. But the Indonesians made it very clear that that visit at that particular time was not convenient for them. That visit by officials had been intended as a precursor to a visit, possibly this weekend, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the minister for immigration.I should inform the House that, from the very beginning of the Tampa issue, the Indonesians had expressed their unwillingness to take the people back, notwithstanding the views that were put to them. That was a view that had been put in the conversation between our foreign minister and the foreign minister of Indonesia. We believe that the people should go back to Indonesia because that was the country of embarkation and because it was Indonesia to which the vessel was bound at the time the duress was applied. The Indonesians are obviously taking a strongly contrary point of view. We will continue to press another view, but in the meantime the government will continue to explore other options as well. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question and recognise his great interest not only in foreign policy issues in general but in Bougainville. Today is a truly historic day in the history of the South Pacific and is a historic day in many respects for our country as well, because today in Arawa, in Bougainville, a comprehensive settlement agreement is to be signed. This is an historic achievement which marks a very important step forward in the Bougainville peace process and in essence brings to an end a bloody civil war which, in its impact on people's lives, was considerably more damaging than the Northern Ireland conflict has been since 1969. Although this does not have the profile of the Northern Ireland conflict, it is a conflict that has taken place right off the coast of Australia. I am very proud of the role our government has played, along with our friends and colleagues in New Zealand, in helping the government of Papua New Guinea and the people of Bougainville to bring about this settlement.I want to pay a special tribute to the government of Papua New Guinea - not just, by the way, the present government of Mekere Morauta, but its predecessor as well - and, of course, to the Bougainville leaders and, very importantly, the people of Bougainville, especially the women, who have made such untiring efforts to bring lasting peace to that province of Papua New Guinea.Australia was invited to the signing ceremony, along with New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu. I particularly want to acknowledge the role played by the 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel and 260 Australian civilian monitors who so far have served in Bougainville as part of the Peace Monitoring Group. We continue to remain committed to that. We have also provided, by the way, close to $100 million in aid to Bougainville over the past few years. What this aid has done has been to help underwrite and encourage the peace process, because, without that aid, there would not have been a peace dividend; and without that peace dividend I think it would have been very hard to keep the peace process together.Today, because of the need for me to be here to help deal with the issue of the MV Tampa, I will be represented in Bougainville by Senator Alan Ferguson. He will do an excellent job representing Australia. All I can say is that it is a matter of personal regret that I am not able to be there with my colleague from New Zealand, Phil Goff, and celebrate this truly great achievement, in which Australia has played such an important part.Having said all this, I am not underestimating the difficulties that still lie ahead with the peace process. It is going to be necessary to get legislation through the Papua New Guinea parliament with an appropriate majority. It is going to be necessary to implement a weapons disposal plan. None of those things is going to be easy. But today is a day that in this country we can truly celebrate as a day when a civil war in our part of the world has come to an end.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question -  -  - Yes, he is a good member. I can inform him that building approvals for the month of July were released today, and they showed that total dwelling approvals increased in that month by 6.3 per cent, coming after a rise of 3.4 per cent in June and 29.1 per cent in May. Private house approvals rose by 11 per cent in July. Since the extension of the First Home Owners Scheme, private house approvals have increased by over 63 per cent. House building is being supported not only by the government's First Home Owners Scheme but also by the historically low interest rates, which currently are at 6.8 per cent, enabling many young Australians to buy and build a house for the first time.I have also been asked about other economic data, and I can inform the House that the trade figures for goods and services for the month of July were released today. They showed that in the month of July Australia recorded a surplus of over $1,089 million. It was the sixth consecutive surplus in a row and the largest surplus on goods and services, excluding the RBA gold sales in 1997, on record in Australia. That backs up the figures yesterday showing Australia's current account deficit fell to its lowest level in 21 years.Although in the July figures exports moved down somewhat, imports moved down more. But compared with July last year, non-rural exports were up 11.5 per cent and rural exports were up 10.6 per cent. Again, I pay tribute to the farmers of Australia for their wonderful export effort in the last year, supported by a competitive exchange rate and also by the fact that, for the first time in Australian history, exports sailed tax free out of Australia on equal terms to all the other countries of the world because this government had the courage to reform the Australian taxation system. I note in passing that the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, is in Mexico at present at a meeting of the World Trade Organisation, pressing for more market access and better conditions for Australian exporters, and we wish him well.Overnight the second revision of US GDP growth for the June quarter was released, and it was revised down somewhat from the first estimate for the June quarter. It implies that the US economy in the June quarter grew by 0.04 per cent, which is marginal at best and probably a false precision. It indicates that, whilst the US economy did not go negative in the June quarter, it was close to zero, showing no growth at all. The Japanese economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the March quarter. In our region Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines had negative quarters in March, and Singapore and Taiwan had negative quarters in June, confirming that both those economies are in recession - and quite a pronounced recession. So the world economy is undoubtedly weakening. The US economy at the moment is weaker than it has been for at least a decade. A good part of our region is now in recession, and that undoubtedly will affect Australia's growth prospects.I can report to the House that, of the industrialised countries that have reported for the March quarter, Australia was the strongest, showing growth at 1.1 per cent. As the world economy weakens, Australia will rely on its exporters and the competitive impetus that they are giving. The kick back in of the housing cycle will be positive for our economy, but nobody should underestimate the difficulties that the world will be facing over future quarters, nor the commitment that Australian exporters have shown and this government will show to keep the Australian economy growing as it is - one of the fastest growing economies in the industrialised world. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. As it happens, I am aware of some very positive reaction on the part of the people who have done the work of the opposition - they have actually looked at what it was before they spoke, they have actually taken the time to go out and appreciate that what we effectively announced yesterday were some significant extra steps on a very significant journey with rural and regional Australia in partnership between the Liberal and National party government and rural and regional communities across the nation. The package represents a very substantial financial commitment, and it has been indeed widely welcomed. I was particularly pleased, I have to say, to note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry went to the trouble -  -  - Their reaction says it all. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry took the time and the trouble to actually have a look at it, and they said in a press release yesterday that the:... policy framework released today is important to give communities and business certainty in planning for their futures and tools to develop growth opportunities.They noted:It also commits the Government to an action plan to remove impediments to business and foster greater industry development in regional communities. That is a positive contribution. We have had no such thing from the ALP, not a positive word yet on what they would do for the regions - nothing, hardly even a question. But according to the media - and I have not actually paid much attention - the member for Batman yesterday actually came up with his first question to me since March. - It was his first question since March. There is still nothing on policy, but it was his first question since March. Then, of course, the National Farmers Federation has put out a statement entitled `Chopped charges excite exporters'. - It does sound good; that is right. - Chopped charges, yes. They actually made a very interesting comment. They said:NFF and its member organisations have been pushing for a decade - and who was in power a decade ago?for a reduction in these charges in a bid to enable our farmers to better compete in an increasingly distorted and competitive global marketplace. The reduction will directly benefit exporters of meat, grain, horticulture, dairy, fish, organics and live animals. Of course, it would also assist everyone who works in those industries, including a lot of very decent Australian workers across the nation, who would like to see their job prospects enhanced by good policy, in direct contradiction of the sorts of policies that we saw in the regions when the ALP were in government.I do not think it would have been too much to expect the ALP to actually analyse what was said, but they did not do that. I suppose you could not have expected them to have actually welcomed it; that would have been too much to expect. It is probably fair enough, I suppose, given the nature of their approach, that they said it was the wrong way to go - although the press release significantly does not actually disagree with anything we have done; in fact, it barely mentions them. I would have to say that it does not offer any alternative approach either. The press release claimed that they had a policy but did not say what it was.Yesterday I said in this place that I thought we had just the whiff of a policy. I said it was not an appropriate policy; it was a very citycentric policy. They were going to close Essendon airport, and the member for Hawker had expressed certain interest in that. The member for Corangamite, indeed -  - Well, members everywhere from Victoria realised, because they had worked very hard on keeping Essendon airport open, how important that was for rural and regional Victorians. So you can imagine my surprise - at least it was, as I said yesterday, the whiff of a policy; it might have been a wrong policy but it was a whiff of a policy - to get back to the office yesterday and find that I had a letter from the shadow spokesman. Do you know what the letter -  - Yes, he can write; well, there was a letter there. Do you know what the letter asked for? It asked me to urgently agree to a request from a company that wants to fly 727 jet aircraft into Essendon airport. There we go. So the shadow spokesman wrote that letter supporting 727 flights into Essendon on 24 August, but on 26 August he goes to a rally in Melbourne where he promises that he wants to close the airport. We are getting closer to the Labor Party actually taking some policy positions, or what they might call policy positions. As far as I can tell, the shadow spokesman's position is this: Labor wants to expand the number of large jet aircraft flying into an airport that it will close because of airport noise concerns. So I have to say in the end: that is not a policy; that is an oxymoron.</DOC>

 - As the Treasurer rightly noted in his answers both today and yesterday, Australian farmers are doing a wonderful job in boosting Australian exports and improving our national economic performance. Farmers in the honourable member for Barker's electorate are certainly contributing in that regard. They have had a lot of help in that from the change of policy direction that has occurred as a result of having a coalition government in office. Under Labor, farmers had no sympathy, no help and no support. Now they are being assisted to achieve their potential, and that is really reaping rich results for our nation as a whole. As the Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday, if you have strong regions, you have got a strong nation - and strong regions are very much driven by strong and healthy rural and regional performance and a healthy farm sector. That has been particularly apparent over recent times.This government's efforts - in response to the question - include a tax reform package which has delivered enormous benefits to regional areas, including low interest rates. Farmers are paying half the interest bill they did when Labor was in office. Low inflation keeps their costs down and, for the first time in ages, farmers' terms of trade have actually improved. There has been a tremendous boost to exports. The reductions in taxes on transport alone have delivered enormous benefits to regional Australia. Over the last five years, this government has invested more than $28.5 billion in more than 300 regional programs to help rural and regional Australia. There has been real progress made in basic services like health, education and telecommunications. The Stronger Regions statement yesterday announced that there would be another $155 million to assist rural and regional Australia.When Labor talk about regions, that means regions that are two miles from the GPO. When we talk about regions, we are talking about the rural and regional parts of Australia that so richly contribute towards the growth and prosperity of our nation. The Sustainable Regions Program alone - $100 million over four years - will help to underpin and provide particular support for those regions that have not yet had the opportunity to fully share in our nation's growth and prosperity.The question also asked about alternative policies. There are not too many of them around, although I noticed the somewhat vain attempt by the shadow minister for agriculture to announce a dairy policy last Friday. The media described it as `low key' -  and with due cause, because I understand the launch was in somebody's kitchen and there were actually more cows around than people. Nonetheless, there was a whiff of a policy, I am told. After eight months of wandering around the countryside at taxpayers' expense to look at the dairy industry, finally we had the release of the opposition's response -  four months after the promised date, but, nonetheless, finally the plan has been released.I studied it with great interest although, to be honest, it did not take all that long to go through it. What I noticed about the 10-point plan, this great plan for the future of the dairy industry, was that it had as its centrepiece nine new studies - not one but nine extra studies. After eight months travelling around the countryside looking at the dairy industry, what Labor recommended was nine extra studies - 10 if you count the one that they want done by two separate bodies. That is Labor's answer to the dairy industry - 10 more studies. There were other recommendations, three that we implemented months ago - Labor have only just caught up with those and have tried to pretend they were their own policies - leaving only one more, and that was their plan to strip the money away from the Dairy Regional Adjustment Program and give it to environmental programs and training. - An amount of 0.3 per cent of our $2 billion worth of assistance to the dairy industry is directed towards dairy communities -  - to help them adjust to the problems of deregulation brought on when the states decided to deregulate the industry - 0.3 per cent. Labor wants to strip that away and spend it on environment programs and training schemes which we already provide under other programs through this government. When Labor finally gets around to launching the policy in a backyard, kitchen or whatever, the policy is utterly empty. It contains more studies and no new answers. That is what Labor will deliver right through this election campaign. If ever it gets into office, there will be no answers, just studies.</DOC>

If you think that you have scored some devastating political hit on me as a result of that, you are even more foolish than I thought you were.

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I am aware of action being taken by the Labor Party at the moment to refuse funding to needy schools in Australia - and nothing shows more clearly the utter hypocrisy of the last question from the member for Dobell. The Labor Party has announced that it will again refuse to pass legislation which will allow the government to meet its legal obligations to new schools from around Australia. The Labor Party's actions are going to deny some $9,000 to the Nyikina Mangala community school in the Kimberley. The Labor Party has already denied $26,000 in legally entitled payments to the Jubilee Catholic Primary School in the electorate of Forde. The Labor Party has left the Living Faith Lutheran Primary School in the seat of Dickson $8,500 short.The Leader of the Opposition says he is only interested in cutting funding to schools that he calls rich schools, but he is now cutting funding, and has cut funding, to these needy schools serving low income communities. The Leader of the Opposition has once again capitulated to pressure behind him from the Australian education lobby, which wants to stop all funding to non-government schools. It is now stopping funding to Catholic parish schools, Christian schools and other low fee community schools. The pressure is mounting on the Leader of the Opposition. Last night on Sky News channel we heard Mr Rodney Molesworth, President of the Australian Council of State School Organisations, say: There is no such thing as a needy Catholic school anymore in comparison with government schools. All the needy schools are government schools, and they need a massive influx of resources right now.I suppose that is why the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition are now denying funding to Aboriginal community schools, which are the neediest schools in Australia and which are schools in the non-government sector. The Labor Party has rolled over once again to pressure. The Leader of the Opposition has rolled back to the lobbies putting pressure on him, which want him to deny all funding to non-government schools. What is now clear from his actions on this legislation on establishment grants is that every one of the 1.3 million parents of students at Catholic parish schools knows that he has them in his sights. The dogs are barking once again and Kim Beazley is listening. All these parents know that a Labor Party government would mean further cuts to needy schools in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. It is predicated - I think that is the best way to describe it - on allegations of an ad campaign, and I had said in relation to questions asked by the member for Dobell that I do not automatically accept that. I said that I would get some advice and that I would provide further information if that was appropriate. I will tell the Leader of the Opposition what my earned media campaign on education will tell the Australian public.Government members - Earned? - Yes, that is one of those expressions to describe the media you get when you do not buy advertising. In other words, if you make a sensible statement about something, the media see fit to cover it. - The Treasurer says, `Very rarely.' I have to say that the Treasurer is right in the case of some media outlets; but I will not get into that because I am hoping they will all cover this answer, so I do not want to offend any of them. I will tell you one or two things that my media campaign will say. It will say that in the current financial year, 2000-01, Commonwealth increases in funding for government schools will rise significantly more than state government increases for state government schools. This is despite the fact that historically - and this was true under the Hawke government, as it is under the Howard government - the great bulk of the funding burden for government schools was carried by state governments -  they are state government schools; they are owned and operated by the state governments - to the tune of 88 per cent; 12 per cent is carried by the federal government.That was the case when Bob Hawke was Prime Minister, it was the case when Paul Keating was Prime Minister and it remains the case now. For example, in this current financial year federal government funding for government schools in New South Wales has gone up by 5.3 per cent. The increase by the Carr government for its own schools is only 2.5 per cent. In the state of Victoria, where the Commonwealth increase is a very healthy 5.4 per cent, the increase by the Bracks government is a lousy 1.8 per cent. In Queensland it is a little better, I have to say: our increase is five per cent, but the increase by the Queensland government lags behind at 4.1 per cent. My note says this: Western Australia - Commonwealth increase, five per cent; state government increase awaiting WA budget. We do await the WA budget, and I wonder if the predictions made about cutting funding in Western Australia to state government hospitals is in fact prescient in relation to government schools. Let us lay to rest this completely false claim being made by the Labor Party that we have in our funding disadvantaged government schools. The reality is that we have increased faster than most of the states our funding provision for government schools in the various states of Australia, despite the fact that they are not primarily our responsibility. They are primarily the responsibility of state governments. The word `state' implies and carries with it the reality that they are owned, operated and staffed by people employed and paid by the state governments. That has been the history of education. So, in response to all this talk coming from the Labor Party and the education unions that in some way we have disproportionate funding allocations, I simply point out that 78 per cent of all government funding in Australia goes to those pupils educated in government schools, which comprise 70 per cent of the total education population. In other words, 78 per cent of the money goes to 70 per cent of the children, and the remaining 22 per cent goes to the 30 per cent of children who are educated in non-government schools.I am very proud of the funding policies that my government has put in place in relation to schools in Australia. We have enhanced the choice available to low and middle income parents in Australia to exercise their freedom of choice. What Labor is doing is voting against establishment grants; it is voting against funding for schools that need help. The funding bill that Labor is going to knock back is not a bill that is going to give money to the King's School, to Wesley College or to Scotch College. Labor is knocking back a bill that is going to give money to parish Catholic schools that need the assistance.The Leader of the Opposition is reminded of what that teacher union bloke Molesworth says. Mr Molesworth says there is no longer such a thing as a needy Catholic school. The Leader of the Opposition, right on cue, gets his mates in the Senate yesterday to indicate that they are going to knock back the commencement grant legislation. Then he gets up and mumbles as a preamble to a question, `Don't worry, they'll get every penny from us.' The way that `they'll get every penny from us' is for the opposition to vote against a bill that would give all the pennies to them! It is a very interesting piece of tortured logic. After 20 years of comparative quiet on this issue, the Labor Party has reintroduced the politics of envy into school funding in the Australian community. That campaign will fail. There are hundreds of thousands of Australian parents who assert the right to choose what school their children should go to. As somebody who benefited very greatly from a state education system, I am very proud of the fact that we have established in this country the best funding system in the Western world for both government and private schools. In this nation we have established a funding system for independent schools that provides help, incentive, support and encouragement for low and middle income parents to send their children to independent schools. It is a great system, and the Labor Party is trying to undermine it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and for his strong support for small business. I am very pleased to tell the House that this is actually a blue-ribbon day for the small businesses of Australia, thanks to the great policies of the Howard government. Today a new unfair dismissal law takes effect that exposes people who bring dodgy unfair dismissal claims to potential costs orders, exposes ambulance chasing lawyers in this jurisdiction to potential fines and, best of all, establishes for all new employees a standard three-month probationary period during which the unfair dismissal laws will not apply. That has happened today thanks to the good work of this government. But this government is not resting on its laurels. Today it has introduced new legislation into the House to further enhance the ability of small business to employ more Australians and to create more jobs. While this government is helping small business, opposition policy is to allow union officials automatic right of entry into the one million small businesses in Australia, to open up their filing cabinets, to rifle through their documents -  - even though fewer than 10 per cent of small businesses employ any union members. Thanks to the opposition's so-called good faith bargaining policy, reiterated yesterday by the shadow minister, small business has to engage in compulsory meetings with unions, compulsory adherence to union agenda, compulsory responses to union demands and compulsory disclosure to unions of the most intimate financial documents. These union officials to whom the opposition wants to expose small business are not all fine men like Johnno Johnson, MLC, who graced us with his presence yesterday. Take for instance, AMWU organiser Tim Murray, who the other day, outside a car component manufacturer in Adelaide, said:Delegates will put a devious little plot together to stuff up production, causing maximum disruption to the company.These are the people with whom the small businesses of Australia are supposed to engage in compulsory bargaining. - Then, of course, there is Craig Johnson, the head of the Victorian AMWU, whose idea of talking to small business is to smash down the door with a crowbar.This government's strong commitment to small business owes a very great deal to an absolutely outstanding Minister for Small Business. The Minister for Small Business had a remarkable tribute paid to him today in the pages of the Australian. Peter Switzer says of the minister:... this bushy from Queensland is fair dinkum in his consideration of the issues that small business cares about.Peter Switzer goes on to say that the minister is `fair dinkum', that he is `on the money', that his responses are `spot on' and that:... there are stats to prove he has been a plus for the Government since he was given the small biz gig.In the three months to August, thanks to a great minister, small business confidence has reached a two-year high. This is a government that supports small business and the ability of small business to create more jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have indicated that it is the intention of the government to try to reach an understanding with the United States administration to negotiate a free trade agreement. It goes without saying that it is going to be a very difficult undertaking. It also goes without saying that it may not ultimately come to fruition. We might start the negotiation and we may find that the price asked by the United States for the agreement is unacceptable and not consonant with Australia's national interest. There is no way we can find out whether a free trade agreement to the mutual advantage of Australia and the United States is possible unless we begin the process of negotiation. It stands to reason that the worst way to approach something like this is to assume the worst outcome - and because that might happen, you do not even try. Of course, the Australian government is not going to negotiate away with the United States or, indeed, any other country the vital interests of any Australian industry - of course, we are not going to do that. If the Leader of the Opposition is saying to me, `It is all very difficult,' of course he is right on this occasion: it is difficult. But I take the view and the government takes the view that the longer term interests of Australia would be enhanced if we could achieve a free trade agreement with the United States - by far the most powerful economy in the world and a great strategic partner of Australia in other ways. We believe that it would be to the advantage of Australia if we could negotiate a free trade agreement with the Americans. Obviously, it has to be on terms and conditions that are acceptable to both. I do not have any delirious expectations, but if we do not try we have no chance of ever succeeding. Apparently, the policy of the Labor Party is to give up before even trying. This is quite a serious issue, which is of long-term interest to the Australian community. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects about the car industry. I tell you what: I did more for the car industry in Adelaide a few weeks ago than your union mates did. Your union mates were out there undermining the jobs of decent Australians in South Australia. That is what they were doing - and you interject about the car industry. You showed absolutely no interest in the car industry. - Mr Speaker, I promise not to respond to any more interjections. I think that a free trade agreement between Australia and the United States, if it could be negotiated, would significantly underwrite the long-term economic strength of this country. There are complementarities between the Australian economy and the Unites States economy. There are also areas of very significant difficulty. Agriculture is an area of significant difficulty. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to another area that is of difficulty, and of course there are areas of resistance in relation to what many in Australia see as some kind of cultural imperialism by the United States. There is concern amongst the entertainment industry about changes that might possibly disadvantage them. I am aware of all of that. The government are aware of all of that. We do not dismiss those things. We do not pretend that they will be easily resolved or easily negotiated away. But we do contend that we ought to make an attempt to negotiate an understanding with the United States. That will be the proposition that I will put to President Bush when I see him on Monday week in Washington.I think the overwhelming interest of the Australian people will be served if we at least endeavour to see if there is a proper basis on which to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States. I would hope that in that endeavour we have the support and the goodwill of the opposition - not for any political advantage to the government but because it happens to be in Australia's national interest that we negotiate a free trade agreement. I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I state at the outset that the demise of Ansett is deeply regrettable and that none of us are at all happy about the plight of its employees - except that this government is moving seriously to address their concerns in a way that the Leader of the Opposition's team have never sought to do in any way, shape or form. The government have known for quite some time, and we have been quite open about our knowledge of the fact -  - Mr Speaker, is the member for Hotham interested in hearing the answer or not? - He's just interested in playing the politics of the issue in the way that his leader has in recent days.  - He has been out there with a big grin on his face -  - Mr Speaker, we have been quite open in acknowledging for quite some time, since we were approached in June, that this company needed recapitalisation. They had a model for that recapitalisation which they wanted us to support. Their CEO came to see me to lobby very hard for it, and I took this very seriously indeed. As a government we always supported the need for Ansett to be recapitalised. That was never in doubt. We formed a view on a possible viable option. I went to New Zealand to meet with the minister for finance over there, Dr Michael Cullen, and the minister for transport, and we agreed there on a process for handling what was obviously a serious situation. That process was that, under a special negotiator that he had appointed - a fellow by the name of Cameron - they would take forward both proposals, because Dr Cullen agreed with me that both the so-called Qantas option and the so-called Singapore option should be fully evaluated and tested. That was done. They were both taken forward. What I want to say is this: that letter - and I have a copy of it here; you quoted from it selectively - certainly came to us, and it again put very clearly to us the view of Air New Zealand that we should support the so-called Singapore option. Nothing that we did at any stage delayed or stalled the process that was in place by which the New Zealand government was to make a decision on the best option for recapitalising Air New Zealand by the time that they reported their financials, which was to have been on 3 September this year. They sought a week's delay. Why? Because, Mr Speaker -   - You say we knew. We had no access to the financials. As we speak today -  - If the whole world knew, is there anyone in the ALP who can produce ANZ's finances? The fact is that they still do not have audited books out there from this outfit. The process was that the New Zealand government was to negotiate with the company the best way forward and the government was to make a decision in time for the issuing of a public statement in early September. They then postponed that for a week during which time it became obvious that the situation was far worse than anyone could have known: the New Zealand government, the board members themselves, Singapore Airlines, the banks - all of those who might reasonably have been expected to have had an idea.This is not an Australian company and we do not have access to the books. We had access only to the information made available to us and to such other people to whom the board had a responsibility, such as the New Zealand Stock Exchange. We supported the company's recapitalisation. We worked with the New Zealand government to ensure that they were in a position to make a timely decision. Air New Zealand was looking to the New Zealand government to make a decision on investment caps and any capital injection that it might choose to make on that side of the Tasman, not us.</DOC>

 - In recent times I have had two conversations with the New Zealand Prime Minister. I spoke to her briefly last Friday evening to express my regret on behalf of the government at the discourtesy that was displayed towards her at Melbourne airport. I repeat to the House that, no matter how deep and understandable may be the feelings of the Ansett employees and others in the Australian community about the behaviour of Air New Zealand, that is no justification for behaving in such a discourteous fashion towards the Prime Minister of a country with whom Australia has long had a very close and important relationship. It is because I have become concerned about the impact of this issue on the bilateral relationship that I rang the New Zealand Prime Minister this morning. I said to her that it was important that both of us worked to ensure that the issue of Ansett and Air New Zealand did not contaminate our bilateral relationship. I would remind the House that on earlier occasions there have been corporate collapses in Australia which have hurt New Zealanders. I think that it is very important to separate the merits of this issue from the bilateral relationship. Having said that, I made it very plain to her that there was very deep anger in the Australian community, particularly among Ansett employees, regarding the behaviour of Air New Zealand. I reaffirmed to her the position of the Australian government that had been maintained throughout by the Deputy Prime Minister, by the Treasurer and, where appropriate, by me that we could not make any equity injection into Ansett and we could not be engaged in a bailout of Ansett.I did, however, inform the New Zealand Prime Minister that we would be willing to guarantee the payment of the workers' entitlements in the terms outlined by my colleague at a press conference this morning - he, incidentally, having been denied the opportunity of outlining the government's position at a meeting convened by the ACTU. The purpose of the government's actions is to try and provide assistance to the employees of Ansett, not to politicise this dispute. I explained to the New Zealand Prime Minister that we would guarantee all of statutory entitlements, that is, unpaid -  -  - I indicated to the New Zealand Prime Minister and I indicate to the House that it has been the position of the government to guarantee the statutory entitlements, that is, the unpaid salary, anything in lieu of notice that is appropriate, long service leave and unpaid holiday pay. In addition to that, we are also prepared to guarantee the payment of up to eight weeks redundancy, which is the community standard.  I might say rhetorically that that is a great deal more than I understand would have been done under the policy in relation to workers' entitlements for the 1,000 employees of Compass. I do not remember there being any bailout by the Keating government of the Compass employees. In fact, I am reminded in the context of Compass -  -  - I am reminded of a comment made by Brian Gray, the former chief executive of Compass Airlines on 22 December 1991. He said:I went to the government on Wednesday and I asked for some relief. Kerin, Beazley and Collins came in and sat down and before I even opened my mouth, Kerin simply said there could be no cooperation from the Commonwealth government. He said, `Under no circumstances will we help you by any means.'That was the attitude. If you think that that is just relying on the verbatim of the former chief executive of Compass, let me also quote from the former minister himself when the request had been rejected: `It would not have mattered, frankly, if the airline had asked the government for $1 billion or $10,' Senator Collins said. `The facts are that the government is not a bank for private airlines. We would not have provided loan funds or extraordinary special purchase of seats to any airline. We have deregulated the market deliberately to remove the government from commercial involvement in airline operations.'They were the words of the Labor minister. Let me return, because I think it is relevant to do so, to the discussion that I had with the New Zealand Prime Minister. I made it plain to her that we would fund the payment of the workers' entitlements and, as will be revealed over the days ahead by the minister responsible, we will make arrangements so that, as soon as the individual claims of employees of Ansett can be properly assessed, we will begin making payments of those entitlements where there is a legal obligation to do so. We will do it, and it will cost -  - The member for Kingsford-Smith implies that we are fobbing something off. It is going to cost $400 million. It is some fob-off to pick up to the tune of almost $400 million the entitlements of the Ansett employees! That is a far more generous thing done by this government in relation to any group of employees than to any other group of employees of any company, including, might I say, a company that keeps getting referred to me by those opposite because on that occasion - and I know they are referring to National Textiles - the full payment was made possible by the contribution of the New South Wales Labor government, which matched dollar for dollar the contribution of the federal coalition government. So, if those who sit opposite want the situation to be completely duplicated, they should approach Mr Bracks and Mr Carr to make up the additional redundancies. I think that would be an extremely good thing to do.I know that there are many on this side of the House who would like to hear the next part of my report to the House of my discussion with the New Zealand Prime Minister. I not only informed her of my intention and the intention of the government to pick up the statutory entitlements and the redundancies up to a community standard of eight weeks but also said to her that that was being done without prejudice to the right of the Australian government - as it would, standing in the shoes of the employees and becoming the creditor of Ansett Australia - to institute legal proceedings against Air New Zealand in order to secure recoupment, on behalf of the Australian taxpayer, of the amount that we are going to lay out to see that the Ansett workers are not left out in the cold. I have made it very plain that our legal rights are fully reserved. What we have done is entirely without prejudice to the right of the Commonwealth government, as it will stand in the shoes of the former employees of Ansett, having paid their entitlements, to recover the amount. In the meantime, it is the intention of this government for proper reasons of financial prudence to introduce a ticket levy in order to fund - I hope, on an interim basis, because I am hopeful that recovery will be secured from Air New Zealand - the cost of paying the entitlements of the Ansett employees. I agreed that it was in everyone's interests that Air New Zealand remain fully viable. There is nothing to be achieved by trade unions in this country or anywhere else boycotting Air New Zealand. All that will do is imperil the jobs of workers in New Zealand and imperil the viability of an airline at a time when, because of the tragedy in the United States, airline travel is under tremendous pressure and the bottom line in the viability of airlines all around the world is under enormous pressure. This is the last conceivable occasion on which anybody with any jot of responsibility would seek to impose a boycott on an airline.No matter how deep may be the feeling, to impose a boycott on Air New Zealand would be the height of irresponsibility. But it is not the height of irresponsibility for a government to do what we have done in relation to Ansett employees' entitlements. We are the only party to this dispute that has put money on the table. The Australian government is prepared to put $400 million of taxpayers' money on the table. We are prepared to recoup that money through a levy. We will pursue, if we are legally able to do so, Air New Zealand to secure reimbursement. In those circumstances, I would say to the opposition: instead of encouraging the ACTU to deny free speech, you ought to try to cooperate with us in settling the dispute.</DOC>

 - The workers employed by Ansett -  - The employees of Ansett will receive from the Commonwealth government all of their statutory entitlements. They will also receive eight weeks redundancy, which is the community standard.  - I have made it clear from Friday, when this matter was discussed by the cabinet, that we thought it appropriate that all of the statutory entitlements be met and we thought that the community standard of eight weeks was appropriate. We are going to fund that with a levy. In relation to National Textiles, and as the House knows, the contribution made by the federal government in relation to that company was matched dollar for by the New South Wales government.  - I repeat: the payment we made was matched dollar for dollar by the New South Wales government, and no amount of furious interjection alters that fact. The payment was matched dollar for dollar. - It is untrue that it was matched dollar for dollar? - I can respond if I wish. Sometimes they make intelligent interjections. - Mr Speaker, I will tell you what I will say to the opposition: if you can persuade the Victorian government and the New South Wales government to match what we are proposing to do with Ansett, there will be rejoicing in all the land.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge the interest that he and many others have in ensuring that people have access to services during the current quite serious disruptions. On 7 September, I was contacted directly by the CEO of Air New Zealand and by the acting chair to say that they intended - and this was the first I had heard of it - to cast Ansett adrift, to let it go, and that it might not be able to continue operating.I immediately came down here and we had people working around the clock on contingency plans. They were worked up during the first half of last week and were well in hand when the voluntary administrator advised me at mid-afternoon on Thursday last that he would have to ground Ansett. As the administrator put it, the cupboard was bare. There was a big fat zero in the bank account; that is all that was there. He said, `To indemnify the operation for just 48 hours could cost the taxpayers of this country up to $170 million.' The Leader of the Opposition apparently knows more than Qantas, more than Singapore Airlines, more than the administrator, more than even the people who are trying to audit the books at the moment. He is a very clever fellow! He just will not produce any evidence of where the information came from. Laurie Oakes said, `Where do you get this information from?' `Oh,' said the Leader of the Opposition, `we like to protect our sources, like you do, Laurie.' The fact is that the cupboard was bare. The payroll for wages and salaries to be paid that afternoon was not there. It could not be funded. We immediately underwrote the operations of the airline on Thursday night to maximise the number of flights that could be completed, to minimise the disruption to Ansett's customers. At the same time, the administrator applied pressure to Air New Zealand to provide $20 million to cover wages and salary payments. That payment was made yesterday and has gone a long way towards bringing staff up to date with their wages and salaries.The government's package of measures was announced at the earliest possible opportunity immediately after the administrator issued his formal announcement grounding the airline very early on Friday morning. They have been well publicised, but let me recap. Qantas undertook to fly stranded Ansett passengers free of charge on the return leg of their journey. That offer has now been extended for a further seven days. The government established a support program for stranded passengers to cover their reasonable travel costs back home and their short-term accommodation until they could arrange travel. Qantas and Virgin offered deeply discounted fares to Ansett passengers holding tickets that they could not use. We immediately started action to compel Air New Zealand to meet its obligations in regard to the entitlements of Ansett employees. We established a special number for Ansett employees to register immediately for the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme and to provide immediate access to job matching services through Job Network. Qantas established a register for Ansett staff and gave a commitment to former Ansett workers that they would get preferential consideration for new positions. At our first cabinet meeting following this, as has been covered by the Prime Minister, we announced what we would do to meet the needs of workers - in a way that is unparalleled in this country and which makes the rank opportunism and hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition stand out starkly whenever he talks about this issue.With regard to regional issues, Qantas very quickly offered an undertaking to do what they could to provide services to those 34 regional centres around Australia that are totally dependent upon Ansett or Ansett subsidiary services. I thank them and their staff, many of whom are working very long hours at the moment, for the efforts they are making in this regard. They have responded very well.We have also put in place measures, including a one-off grant to assist operators, to maintain services to regional centres. Assistance has already been provided for routes in the Northern Territory and South Australia. As of this morning, Sunshine Express in Queensland has been approved for the Brisbane to Thangool service and Airlink in New South Wales for a service between Dubbo and Broken Hill. Those services will start shortly. So, as we speak, 23 of those 34 centres are now being serviced and another seven are under consideration; for example, in Western Australia now they are all being covered. Some of those outstanding places do have reasonably short drives to airports where there are services operating. None of us would wish this inconvenience on people, but I thank them for their patience and understanding. I indicate that we will do all in our power to keep services going until there are new entrants in the field and replacement services to regional centres right across the nation.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asks about all companies associated with Ansett. I do not know whether he asks that in a strictly corporate law sense or whether he asks it in an everyday language sense, because a lot of companies are associated with a large company in an everyday language sense. I will check the cabinet record, but my understanding of the decision that we took last Friday was that it covered the employees of Ansett and of wholly owned subsidiaries.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for McPherson for her question. I welcome this opportunity to tell the Ansett workers what the government is doing to help - a chance that I was not given just an hour ago at a meeting addressed by members opposite. I can very much understand why Ansett workers feel very angry indeed because they have been badly let down by their management. The idea that senior management in Ansett should be paying themselves huge bonuses at the time that they were flying their airline into the ground borders on the obscene.This government believes that Ansett and Air New Zealand have a heavy legal and moral responsibility to workers. We believe that Air New Zealand should pay those entitlements, and we believe that entitlements should be paid in full by the employer. If Air New Zealand cannot pay and will not pay, this government will stand behind those workers. This government will guarantee 100 per cent of statutory entitlements. We will pay all annual leave, all long service leave, all unpaid wages, up to five weeks pay in lieu of notice and up to eight weeks redundancy. We will pay 100 per cent of annual leave; we will pay 100 per cent of long service leave; we will pay 100 per cent of unpaid wages; and we will pay 100 per cent of the community standard where redundancy is concerned.This government will stand behind Ansett workers to the extent of close to $400 million. This is absolutely unprecedented in Australia's history, and it ought to be noted by the House that no Labor government is contributing a cent to protect the entitlements of Ansett workers. Governments cannot bail out airlines, they cannot and should not try to run airlines, but this government will stand shoulder to shoulder with Ansett employees in their hour of need in a way no other government ever has.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition's claim is absurd. Any suggestion that I or any Australian had access to the books of Air New Zealand is absurd.  - I have the very letter that you are referring to here and I will read to you the last sentence:However, an early re-capitalisation of the Group with assistance from SIA remains the preferred position adopted unanimously by the Group's Directors.It was a strong plea for support for their model for getting out of trouble, which we did not stand in the way of at any time.It may be that the Leader of the Opposition does not particularly want to hear my position on this because he has politically opportunistic reasons for trying to hang me out to dry. Perhaps he is interested in hearing what the New Zealand Prime Minister had to say about this. Prime Minister Clark is of the same political persuasion as the Leader of the Opposition. I would have thought this point was obvious: if any government had access to the full books, it would have been the government that Air New Zealand was trying to negotiate their package with. That would have been the government, would it not, that would have had full and open access? Here is what Prime Minister Clark had to say two days ago: Yeah, hang on. In the last few weeks, what I can say to you is that no-one, including Air New Zealand, had the slightest idea of how gross their recapitalisation problems were until the government negotiator went in there ... and Singapore Airlines starting doing due diligence.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. This House has already expressed the deepest sympathy and support for all of the Australians tragically affected by the recent terrorist attacks that took place in New York and Washington.My department has received some 35,000 calls and has returned calls to the 8,000 people who chose to register their details. On the basis of these painstaking efforts, I can offer the House some comfort - albeit very limited comfort - and that is that, of the 69 Australians who remained unaccounted for yesterday, I can now confirm that 17 of them are safe and sound. As the situation in New York City stabilises, a number of Australians there have been able to re-establish contact with their families back home and allay concerns for their welfare. The Consulate General in New York has also been able to settle a number of cases, obviously very much to the relief of family members back here in Australia.It is, though, to my deep regret that our work has established that, in addition to the three deaths confirmed earlier, there may be at least 20 Australians for whom the worst must be assumed. These people were most certainly in the World Trade Centre at the time of the attacks, most in the top floors of the building, and have not been heard from since. We are still seeking to resolve 32 cases in which families initially reported very serious concerns. In some of these cases we have been unable to contact original informants. While my officials are conducting thorough investigative work on these cases, I urge all Australians who reported information to us but have not heard back to make themselves available for contact by my officials.My department is working hard and, if I may say so, with great compassion to support the families of the victims and others affected by the crisis. The government has arranged for identification forms required by the New York Police Department to be return couriered to families of victims. Officers are in touch with family members travelling to the United States in order to meet them when they arrive. The Consul General in New York, Ken Allen, who I think has done a simply outstanding job - and after all he has only been there for a very few weeks - is opening his home to those traumatised by the crisis, and professional counselling is available to help ease the burden of grief for loved ones. We will continue to work around the clock in an effort to identify Australians involved in this simply appalling catastrophe and to provide support to those families who are still awaiting news.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition's questions appear to be predicated on the belief that we are somehow trying to deny that we knew that Ansett needed recapitalisation. We have not denied that. We have never denied that. From the time that they came to see us we acknowledged that they needed recapitalisation. And that is what they told us on 27 June when Toomey and others came to see me; they said that Ansett operating losses were serious, they had around $1 billion in reserves - that is what they told us - and that they needed to recapitalise, but they wanted to do it calmly and without being rushed. Against that background, as I said earlier, the government considered its position. I went to New Zealand, we set up a process - or Michael Cullen set up a process - for taking forward consideration of the options in a way to make a timely decision by the time that Air New Zealand went public with their figures this year on its future.This was a concerning letter. But you presume that it was in our power in Australia to take decisions here. It was not. This was a matter between Air New Zealand and the New Zealand government. We were fully cooperating with them in exploring all avenues to find a solution, but the decisions were theirs. No-one denies that. Air New Zealand does not deny that. Ansett does not deny that. The New Zealand government does not deny that. So the simple fact of the matter is - and I was in regular contact with Dr Michael Cullen - that they were moving quickly with their negotiator to establish the needs of Air New Zealand and to secure its future.I will tell you something. I have met a few finance ministers in my time. You would not be surprised, Mr Speaker, if I were to say that our current finance minister is a very good one. I can think of a couple of past finance ministers that know all about deficits and all about how to run shows into the ground. But I am going to say this, just to show that I am bipartisan occasionally: the New Zealand Minister of Finance - I think the Treasurer would agree - is a capable and convincing individual. And I make this point out of this: he repeatedly said to me, `The last thing we can afford to do is to allow this group to fall over.' And I tell you I believed him. If anyone had an incentive to keep their national carrier in the air it was them. And of course we supported them in that. We supported them in seeking to keep that outfit flying.I will make a couple of other points about that letter. Of course it indicated they had a serious position. There is the idea that they had thrown open their books. I just repeat: nobody can throw open the books - they are still being audited. No-one really knows what the true position is yet. That is the reality of it. The Leader of the Opposition cannot deny that; that is a simple matter of fact. Let me just plainly indicate that what this letter said was that the two businesses are `deeply enmeshed'; they are tied together by the debt levels entered into to acquire the Ansett business. No reasonable person in my position would ever have contemplated that Air New Zealand was going to separate Ansett out and dump it. I could never, ever have been in a situation where, as this very letter confirms, they would disentangle themselves -  - I just say to you that at no stage did I or the government take any action other than to seek -  - the fullest cooperation with New Zealand as they sought to find a future for this airline.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. The government has and will continue to consider closely ways in which to support the United States at this time. Members are of course aware that we have invoked the ANZUS Treaty. In accordance with that treaty, the government will continue to closely consult with the United States in relation to any response, militarily or otherwise, that may be deemed appropriate.I can advise the House that the ADF has already commenced the provision of support to the United States in various areas. It is public knowledge, for example, that we have extended the deployment of HMAS Anzac in the Persian Gulf; and 160, or thereabouts, Australian crew will continue therefore to make that contribution. We did also over the weekend, in response to a request, make available a C130J Hercules plane, and that was used for the transport of emergency personnel from Atlanta to New York.In addition to those things, RAAF personnel currently on exchange with US forces have been involved in flying combat air patrols over the continental United States. We have a number of Australians from the ADF serving in exchange and liaison positions with the United States at any one time. Those personnel have been authorised to deploy with US forces in the context of the units in which they have been assigned. That, of course, includes deployments both inside the United States and abroad. Of a total of 295 ADF personnel serving in the US, there are 82 ADF exchange personnel and 40 ADF liaison officers currently deployed with US forces. Approximately 28 of these are currently available for deployment.The ADF personnel deployed with US units perform a wide variety of duties in combat and combat support functions. Examples typically include pilots and weapons systems officers attached to fighter bomber, tactical airlift and maritime surveillance units; Army personnel attached to infantry, aviation and special forces units; and seamen, officers, pilots and warfare officers attached to US naval vessels. We are also assisting the United States through intelligence efforts and cooperation, although members will appreciate that, in accordance with convention, I am not in a position to provide further details. These are all important contributions that are being made today by Australian Defence Force personnel. We can be proud of the quality of our people and confident and reassured in the important and professional contribution that they are making in the fight against terrorism.</DOC>

 - I have no detailed information from them to table from that point in time. It does not exist. I am sorry to have to tell you that. As to what we knew about daily operating losses, there were wildly fluctuating reports. You have to remember that it was only 12 days ago that a steady-as-she-goes statement was made to the New Zealand Stock Exchange that said, `Everything is on track; our recapitalisation plan is still on the table.' I was getting reports saying that their yields were starting to improve because they were building their passenger numbers up again.In terms of what happened last week, we were getting indications about modest daily operating losses, perhaps in tune with that $18 million a week. The problem is that, as soon as the voluntary administrator was in place and got enough of a look at the financial realities to be able to tell us whether we had a chance of indemnifying him for a little while - whether $50 million or $60 million might have given us a week or whatever - we got the information that we would be looking at $120 million to $170 million just to indemnify it for two days, such was the nature of the massive outstanding accounts and such was the nature of the daily operating losses that we had not been informed of. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. Last night the New York Stock Exchange reopened for the first time since the tragic terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last week. The New York Stock Exchange Dow Jones index fell by 685 points, which was the largest points fall in its history. In percentage terms it was down 7.1 per cent, which was significantly less than the October 1987 crash. The Australian Stock Exchange recovered somewhat this morning. It was down about 7.7 per cent on its position before the terrorist attacks in New York. Overnight the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.5 per cent. Also cutting interest rates was the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank and a number of other central banks which made statements overnight that they were cutting interest rates to ensure liquidity in the wake of the terrorist attacks and also to support weakened growth. Prior to the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the US economy had practically ground to a halt. The growth in the second quarter of the US was just 0.04 per cent, which is basically no growth at all. It is a false precision to actually record growth of those sorts of amounts. Since the House has met, the Japanese have reported for their second quarter a negative quarter of 0.8 per cent. In the second quarter, Germany had no growth at all, France and the UK were at 0.3 per cent and Italy had a negative quarter. In our region many of the economies are now in recession. Singapore is in quite substantial recession, as is Taiwan. We can observe in this region that the economic position is as serious as it has been in the last decade - matched only by the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The attacks on the financial system in New York could not have come at a worse time, because the US economy had not grown in the second quarter and was expected to be weaker in the third. To the degree that the disruption has occurred, it will affect US confidence. The effects on the stock markets were particularly felt, as one might imagine, in relation to the airline industry and the insurance industry. But secondary or wider effects will flow through confidence measures. We must remember that the US economy is a vast economy - something like $US10 trillion and 250 million people. So the direct economic effects will not be a large proportion of that, but the secondary effects through business or consumer confidence could be more significant.Here in Australia last Wednesday - of course, overshadowed by the terrorist attacks - we got the results for the second quarter. The Australian economy grew at 0.9 per cent, which was stronger than any of the G7 countries and, again, one of the strongest growth rates in the industrialised world. Since then the labour force figures have been released for August. They showed that total employment increased by 77,000 jobs in August, that the unemployment rate fell and that, since March 1996, around 882,000 jobs have been created in Australia. The domestic economy was strong in Australia in the second quarter. Household consumption was strong and dwelling investment is showing forward indicators - that is, it is showing that it will pick up in this quarter and next quarter and, particularly in the next quarter, it will start contributing to employment growth again. Whilst the Australian domestic economy has strengthened, as one would hope, at a time of severe world slowdown, the risks to the Australian economy come from the world situation. The downturn of the United States, Japan and Europe is synchronised - a synchronised downturn the degree to which we have not seen for at least a decade. In those circumstances, economic policy must be directed at keeping the domestic economy strong and supporting the domestic economy to offset the international weakness. We should not underestimate the challenges that now lie in front of us. The economic challenges will be quite severe. They were severe anyway and have been worsened by the terrorist attacks in New York. I can assure the Australian public that the government will be supporting strong continued domestic growth. It will be underpinned by the low interest rate regime which is at historical lows here in Australia. It will be underpinned by a gathering strength in the housing sector and also by Australia's exporters, who have shown fabulous resilience in the face of a world downturn. In some of the most difficult conditions, they have actually increased export volumes. That, too, will be supported by the tax changes which have taken taxes off exports and allowed our exporters to compete on an equal footing with exporters from around the world. These challenges should not be underestimated. Australia will not be immune from the world developments. So far we have held stronger growth than any of the G7 major industrialised countries or of the developed world. Economic policy will be directed towards strengthening the Australian economy in these circumstances.</DOC>

 - Does the Leader of the Opposition claim that those are the books? Are they the books? They withdrew the financials, and they did not give me the piece of paper. This is a serious matter; we did not dismiss the concerns they raised. We did not say that we were walking away from this or that we would not help. But can I just remind the House that this was no longer an Australian owned company - that is point 1. Point 2: they did not actually request of us that the Australian government - do what? Pump in money? Send a gunboat to New Zealand? What is it that the Leader of the Opposition feels we should have done at that point in time that we did not do? As I explained to that meeting, Mr Toomey explained the situation as he saw it. He said in the Financial Review the next day, 28 June 2001:We've certainly explained to them the capital needs, and the Government's primary concern will obviously be the ongoing viability of Ansett ...That is right: it was. He went on to say that the airline was `not necessarily looking for a quick answer'. He said:It's a hugely important issue for us. To try to rush it through is not in our interest. Frankly, we don't want to push things and get the wrong answer. In the Courier-Mail on 27 June 2001, deflecting speculation that trouble prone Air New Zealand was running out of cash, Mr Toomey said that the airline had `a billion dollars in the bank'. In those circumstances, all our public utterances indicated that we clearly understood that Ansett needed to be recapitalised. The process for that recapitalisation was one of negotiation between Air New Zealand and the government in New Zealand. They wanted a lift in the foreign investment cap in that country from 25 per cent to 49 per cent, and they wanted our support for it. I went to New Zealand after the government had considered the matter. We put what we thought was worth considering on the table, at the same time as that proposal, and they were considered in parallel by Mr Cameron, the government's negotiator over there. If there was one thing that we absolutely agreed on, it was that Ansett needed to be recapitalised and it needed to be a strong airline into the future. There was never any dispute about that. It was always taken as read that the New Zealand government would seek to secure a strong future for Air New Zealand and that they were working towards that objective. The idea that we were not sympathetic is absolutely wrong. We knew they needed recapitalisation. The suggestion that we did nothing is not right. Inasmuch as it was our job and our responsibility to facilitate New Zealand reaching a timely decision, we did so. Really, in the end, attempts to paint us as somehow being responsible for this or standing in the way of a solution will be very easily rebutted by Dr Cullen.  - If the member for Batman thinks that document constitutes a financial statement, he has even less awareness with his union background about how business operates and how jobs are created than I thought he did.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. I can tell the honourable member that, following the full Federal Court decision of yesterday to allow the Commonwealth appeal and to set aside the decisions previously made by Mr Justice North, the asylum seekers, and those on board who may, of course, be there for other reasons, will be transferred to Nauru or subject to an offer and consent to New Zealand for consideration of any claims that they may make. The reports I have seen in the media that suggest that passengers on the HMAS Manoora are refusing to disembark from the vessel I think are a little exaggerated. It is certainly the case that some have said to the International Organisation for Migration - and they are from the second vessel, the Aceng - that they do not wish to disembark. But the fact is that the persons on board should disembark if they wish to be able to have any claims that they want to make considered.We will be in a position to stage disembarkation in a safe and orderly movement from tomorrow, and those transfer arrangements will be guided by those on the ground in Nauru, including the ADF and the International Organisation for Migration. In the case of people opting to have their claims considered in New Zealand, of course there are difficulties in terms of the availability of commercial aircraft for that transfer. It may impact upon the way in which the 150 that New Zealand said it would take will be moved to New Zealand, but my expectation is that persons will be disembarked within a few days, with initial transfers from tomorrow. They will be required to disembark in order for their claims to be considered, and the only options for consideration of claims are Nauru and New Zealand.  There are a small group on the Aceng who have said that they insist that they be sent to Australia. That is suggestive of two things. The first is that if they require to be somewhere safe and secure, they would achieve that outcome by being on Nauru. If the issue is safety and security - and that is the issue that ought to be looked at in terms of any claims for refugee status - they obtain it by going to Nauru. The second thing is that the insistence that they come to Australia is indicative that, having paid up to $US16,000 - it is said - to board the Aceng, they have an expectation of a migration outcome. In other words, their only option is Australia. It is their concern about what people smugglers have led them to believe that brings them to that view. The government's position is firm on this. The only option is for people to disembark from the Manoora if they are going to have claims considered, and we will ensure that that happens. We will be counselling them that that is the only option, we will be using the IOM for that purpose, and I would expect that they will see that that is the only way in which their claims can be dealt with.I would like to take this opportunity to thank the ADF and the International Organisation for Migration for the work that they have already undertaken, and I thank the UNHCR for their cooperation in ensuring that these matters are dealt with on Nauru.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It was, as he said, mere speculation, and hardly worth consideration. The fact is that it had no relevance or currency. The government's position was quite plain, always known and always declared: that Ansett needed recapitalisation and we were facilitating the New Zealand government as they sought the best way to do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for that question, because it does enable me to expand on issues that I have been commenting on elsewhere in the course of the last few weeks. The government has been most active in relation to the range of measures that ought to be pursued to discourage people-smuggling. These have included working with other members of the international community to minimise outflows from countries of origin, and we are working with other countries to disrupt people-smuggling operations and to intercept the clients of people smugglers en route to their destinations.Last week I circulated a paper which is a comprehensive statement on all of the initiatives that we have undertaken. I will table that paper, because it would take a considerable amount of time to canvass all of the issues in it. To give honourable members an idea, it deals with prevention strategy; targeted aid funding; information campaigns; technical cooperation, capacity building and information exchange with other governments; and international cooperation to enhance the integrity of the global protection system. In the area of disruption, it deals with Australia's resources that we have placed overseas, particularly in relation to compliance and liaison officers; technical cooperation and capacity building that have been undertaken in countries which people transit; intelligence gathering and exchange; and regional cooperation aimed at interception of irregular movements. Of course, it includes the reception arrangements that we have in operation here in Australia, including detention arrangements and processing, legislative measures we have taken, and negotiations on return. I table that paper for the information of honourable members.  The further measures that we are undertaking are to ensure that people who are being trafficked do not get better outcomes if they come to Australia than if they are processed, as they can be, through the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The measures that we will be implementing include the excision of Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef, the Cartier Islands and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands from the migration zone for the purpose of the acceptance of unauthorised arrivals. - The effect of that will be to exclude them. It will not impact adversely upon the citizens of Cocos or the citizens of Christmas Island. - I make that point very clearly. - The stricter visa regime that will also be included in the bill, that deals with the other measures that we will be implementing, ensures that those people from countries of first asylum, who are processed in an orderly way, will get permanent protection. Those who are processed from places like Indonesia will receive a temporary protection visa, with access at a later point in time to permanent entry. Those who are processed from Christmas Island or from Nauru will only ever - unless the minister lifts the bar - be eligible for a temporary protection permit. The point we are making is that, if people want to get outcomes where their protection claims are properly recognised, they should do it in the country of first asylum or they should do it in Indonesia. They should certainly not seek to do it in one of Australia's external territories.We are also going to increase the consequences of people being involved in smuggling activities. Even though we increased the penalties for being involved in smuggling five or more individuals to a maximum of 20 years penal servitude, for first offenders the courts have generally imposed penalties of only two years, and with remissions that has been less than one year. With the earnings that people can make while they are in jail, and with the medical attention and dental treatment that they receive there, people often go back in a considerably advanced position. That has been of concern to us. We will be legislating to provide for adult people smugglers minimum sentences of five years, with a non-parole period of three years, and eight years for those who have committed a second offence, with a non-parole period of five years.These measures are consistent with our international obligations. These measures have been looked at very carefully in terms of our work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We are not walking away from ensuring that people who need protection get it. We are ensuring that those people do not get a better outcome, if they are smuggled into Australia, than they would get in dealing with the organisation best equipped to deal with their claims. Nobody should oppose measures that will effectively address people smuggling. If further measures are required to deal with it, I would hope that we continue to get ongoing cooperation.</DOC>

 - That was in the context of the statement that they had just made to the New Zealand Stock Exchange. It would have been grossly irresponsible for me to have sought to undermine confidence, to have attacked the prospects for that company and the people that it employs and to have further weakened its position -  - when the formal advice given by the board - which I have here - indicated that they were -  - trading more effectively, that their rescue plan was still on the table and that they were seeking to finalise their strategic plan before taking it to Dr Cullen for the final decision of that government.</DOC>

 - The Howard government already has in place a comprehensive and well tested national antiterrorist plan. This plan is our blueprint for protecting Australia from politically motivated violence, and it has allowed us to respond quickly to the situation in the United States. Indeed, I would like to thank the many men and women in the portfolio agencies involved during the last week - in particular, my own - for their outstanding efforts in facilitating a rapid and effective response in Australia. It has been the combined efforts of men and women involved in protective security and coordination policy, the intelligence community and our law enforcement agencies that have put into practice our well tested procedures under the national antiterrorist plan.The terrorist attacks in the US have shocked the world. At the moment, there is nothing to suggest that there is any risk in Australia as a result of the attacks in the United States. However, we have taken the precaution of putting Australia on a heightened security alert. This is standard practice under the national antiterrorist plan. Australia has in place a legal regime to deal with the various types of international terrorism. We are a party to nine of the 11 antiterrorism conventions currently in force, covering things such as hijacking, acts of violence against aircraft and hostage taking. We are in the process of becoming a party to the other two conventions, and we have supported the ratification of the statute of the International Criminal Court. The Prime Minister has firmly committed Australia to standing with the United States and other partners in the response to the cowardly attacks in the United States. The Minister for Defence has already in question time outlined some response. I can say that the security and intelligence agencies are continuing their extensive cooperation that has been in place with overseas agencies for some years now.We have also introduced additional aviation security measures at our major domestic and international airports in response to the attacks. We have a proactive and ongoing aviation security awareness program. Indeed, following a request from a protective security coordination centre within my department, state and territory police have been conducting security assessments of the chartered airline industry. The Howard government has a close working relationship between law enforcement and the intelligence community on matters such as terrorism, drug trafficking, people-smuggling and arms smuggling, as was evident at the Olympics, and it is again evident in the firm approach to people-smuggling. The government is also in the process of reviewing the level and nature of support provided to law enforcement agencies by Commonwealth intelligence agencies. The government established the National Security Committee of cabinet as long ago as 1996 with a true all-of-government focus. Australia has a highly effective national coastal surveillance system, Coastwatch, with a fleet of vessels, planes and experienced personnel that patrol the Australian coastline 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. Last year the Coastwatch surveillance network detected and intercepted nearly 99 per cent of illegal immigrants before they reached Australia. Australia will continue to coordinate its activities between the security and intelligence agencies within Australia and with overseas agencies, and any further response to the attacks in the United States will be considered by the government as necessary.</DOC>

 - As I recall that meeting, they certainly had pieces of paper that they were using to give us advice. Again, I think they may have even had one of those things that they flip over, which I did not regard - coming to what was Dr Farmer's claim today that the airline presented me with a set of financials - as a set of financial figures. It was an overview. -  - That is right. I am seeking to be transparent and open in this process. My understanding is that they indicated that they were not prepared to give me more detailed information and actually withdrew the paper that had that. I was not given, and did not take receipt of, any paper out of that meeting. As for my advisers, I have sought preliminary advice from my office as to whether any of those personnel did. They have indicated to me that they did not but that they are double checking, and I will report to the House if there is further information. Again, let me make the essential point out of this. The essential point is that I was not given detailed information. What sort of a CEO would, in the context of telling me that they had operating -  - Would anyone believe it remotely reasonable to put the proposition that, at the same time as they had a piece of paper saying they were about to fall over and that it was absolutely chronic and that Australia should do whatever, they would also advise us that they had $1 billion in cash reserves and could continue to trade for a very long time, that there was no immediate crisis but that they were looking forward to their long-term recapitalisation? The reality in all of this - that of course those opposite do not want to face - is that there was no clear picture seen, on the part of the board of this company, of their true position. There still is not today. There is no audited set of books. I do not know how many times we have to repeat that, nor do I know how many times we have to clearly indicate that it was not lost on us as a government that the company needed recapitalisation. That was not lost on us. We sought to facilitate those people who had to make the decisions, to ensure that that recapitalisation took place. It is certainly true that we vigorously pursued an alternative proposal, which was developed in parallel as part of the New Zealand processes. But that in no way stalled, diminished or in any way reduced the opportunities for Air New Zealand to recapitalise and negotiate that with the New Zealand government. I do not know how much more clearly I can seek to emphasise that. - The statement from the member for Batman is quite simply contemptible. It is just absurd and contemptible; it really is. Such has been his interest in this matter that, until this point in time, he has not sought to ask me or any member of the government a single question about the process.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Boothby for his question. The events in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania last week have obviously caused terrible suffering and shock, and no amount of money can adequately compensate for the real impact of loss of life. As New York returns to work, both financial markets and individual businesses are rapidly trying to assess the financial impact of the horrendous events. The Commonwealth government is actively monitoring these assessments. At this stage, I am advised that it is simply too early to tell what ultimate impact the United States events will have on business and, in particular, on the global insurance industry and the industry in Australia. However, individual insurance companies will be affected either directly or indirectly because of their global risk profiles. For example, when the hailstorms hit Sydney in April 1999, Australian based insurers paid a very heavy price, but they also relied heavily on existing reinsurance contracts and support provided by insurance companies in the United States and around the world. For the events in the United States, the payout risk is mainly borne by US based insurers. However, other insurers around the world will also have to contribute. Yesterday QBE Insurance formally announced that the New York terrorist attacks would result in a substantial cut in its profit for this financial year. This is due to the fact that QBE was involved in personal injury and aviation cover and reinsurance protections in place in the United States and through Lloyd's and European company operations. QBE has advised the market and APRA, the prudential regulator, that its underlying businesses and its balance sheet remain strong and that, even with these provisions, it meets our new general insurance prudential standards by a factor of 1.32 times.I am advised that, for other reinsurers in Australia and other insurance companies in Australia, their exposure is held in many cases by parent companies offshore. However, I have asked the prudential regulator, APRA, to examine the possible implications of the New York events for the Australian insurance market and to keep me informed of developments. Moreover, I have asked APRA to liaise with the relevant authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom to closely monitor and, if necessary, respond to unfolding events. In addition, APRA, ASIC and the Australian Stock Exchange are meeting regularly to monitor current issues and to ensure that the market is fully informed in accordance with the law.Obviously, insurance is not just about events that have occurred; it is also about the risk of future events. The government is obviously closely monitoring how the Australian insurance industry and, indeed, the broader financial services industry are coping with changing world events. Like everyone else, the Australian financial services industry - especially like New York overnight - is getting back to business in a very calm and rational manner. It is assessing the full impacts of the devastating losses.</DOC>

 - I learned of this proposal from Qantas last night. - I learned of this proposal last night, and within an hour of learning of it I told both the chairman and the managing director of Qantas that it was unacceptable to the government that foreign aircraft and crews should be brought in while there were Australian aircraft and Australian crews ready and willing. I say immediately to the Leader of the Opposition that, having learned of it, I actually did something about it on behalf of the Australian people. I did more: I had a lengthy discussion with the chairman and the managing director of Qantas. In the course of that discussion, the chief executive of Qantas indicated to me that there were three things that were having an effect on a speedy conclusion of the wet leasing arrangements that Qantas wanted to negotiate with the liquidator. The first of those related to airline insurance, which has obviously been complicated by the tragic events in the United States. I indicated to the chief executive of Qantas that, subject to establishing that the exposure to the Commonwealth and therefore the taxpayer would not be unacceptably high, the government itself might be willing to assist on an interim basis in relation to insurance. At the present time, officers of my department and of the Department of Transport and Regional Services are investigating internationally the arrangements which are being made by the British government and the United States government in relation to insurance arrangements concerning their airlines. Clearly, I cannot expose, and the government will not expose, the Australian taxpayer to an unacceptable risk, but that matter is continuing to be investigated. The second matter that was raised with me by the chief executive of Qantas is that one of the difficulties being encountered by the administrator was that some of the union interests were indicating that the Ansett crews were not willing to accept Qantas working conditions. -  - I can only repeat what I was told by the managing director of Qantas.  -  - I was informed by the managing director of Qantas that that was the second difficulty. The third difficulty related to the question of arrangements being made between the administrator and the lessors of the aircraft. I was informed just before question time commenced that the administrator and Qantas were working to resolve these difficulties as speedily as possible. It is my hope that, if they can be resolved, it will be possible for those wet lease arrangements to be put into effect within the shortest possible time.We do not want additional foreign aircraft and crews brought into this country while there are aircraft and crews ready and willing to operate. I have made that very clear to Qantas, although Qantas felt that the time delay involved in the wet leasing arrangements being concluded with the administrator meant that bringing in the foreign aircraft was a better short-term solution. I am disturbed at the delay in these wet leasing arrangements, and I would ask the administrator, the unions, Qantas and everybody involved, if they are serious about finding a solution rather than scoring political points, to actually cooperate and find a solution. We are prepared to cooperate, provided there is not an unacceptable insurance exposure. I make that clear. I am not prepared to expose the Australian taxpayer to an unacceptable risk in relation to insurance. We are in the process of finding out what the British and the United States governments are doing, but so far, far from the Leader of the Opposition's suggestion that we are in some way indifferent to foreign aircraft being brought in while there are Australian aircraft and Australian crews available to work, the opposite is the case, and I have made that perfectly clear to Qantas.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question and for the concern he shows for the welfare of Australians who might be travelling, or who are intending to travel. Clearly, at this extraordinarily difficult time in the international community, it is especially important that my department and I inform Australian travellers of the potential risks to them wherever they may be thinking of going or wherever they are. In order to make sure that we have the best available information, not only are we drawing on the resources of our own embassies, high commissions and consulates around the world, we are also working very closely with our traditional consular partner countries, the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. In the light of the events in the United States on 11 September, the government urges all Australians contemplating travel to the Middle East or to South-West and Central Asia to review their travel plans. If they do decide to proceed with travel, they should be extremely careful in doing so. Travellers should avoid any large public gatherings or demonstrations and keep themselves well informed of developments that might in one way or another affect their safety. Anybody who is thinking of travelling to Afghanistan or Pakistan at this time should immediately postpone their travel. Moreover, notwithstanding encouraging developments between Israel and the Palestinians in recent days, people travelling more broadly in the Middle East should be aware that tensions in that region remain very high following the attacks on the United States.Last week we advised all Australians in Afghanistan to depart the country, and I am pleased to report that all those known to us were able to do so as part of a United Nations evacuation operation. However, I remind the House that we have two Australians, Peter Bunch and Diana Thomas, who remain in prison in Afghanistan along with colleagues from the United States and Germany. We remain very concerned about their welfare. They are subject to a trial in the Taliban supreme court. As I understand it, that trial is not complete. We are doing everything we can to keep in touch with them through a locally engaged consular agent employed in Kabul by the American, German and Australian governments. Obviously, in our case, we are focusing very much on the welfare of those two Australians. We have received assurance that both those Australians continue to be treated well.In answer to the honourable member's question, let me say that yesterday I instructed my department to urge all Australians in Pakistan to consider leaving the country. The high commission in Pakistan is circulating this advice to the Australian community through its system of consular wardens.In conclusion, I thank the honourable member for his question and I remind all Australians that this is a very tense and very difficult time internationally, and to be especially careful if they are in, or considering visiting, anywhere in South-West Asia or in the Middle East.</DOC>

 - I have waited three years for this: a question on tourism from the ALP. -  - Since I have been the minister for tourism, we have seen an incredible time in the tourism industry. We have seen record growth. Last year we saw an excellent year for international tourism. - In one week we have had an airline crash into the World Trade Centre, killing nearly 5,000 people and affecting people's confidence in flying, and we have seen a domestic airline put in the hands of an administrator. - This is a challenge, and the only thing that the ALP can do is run around like Henny Penny saying, `The sky is falling in.' That was my quote. The ALP has nothing to contribute to this debate, except to say, `The sky is falling in. It is a catastrophe; it is cataclysmic, it is devastation.' - The tourism industry in Australia is strong; we have strong entrepreneurial people. We came through the Asian crisis, and why? Because this government delivers good economic fundamentals. We just delivered to the Australian people $12 billion worth of tax cuts. We have record low interest rates, which is putting cash in the hip-pockets of Australians. Where are they going to travel? They are going to travel in Australia, except the ALP wants them to stay at home: `There will no flights; you can't afford it; stay home.' In fact, it indulges in a bit of Kiwi bashing, as well - our one bright hope; our leading market. We receive 700,000 tourists a year from New Zealand, and you do not want them to come. That New Zealand market is more important now than ever, and we certainly want them coming here on Air New Zealand or on any airline we can get. Let's get them here; let's get that tourist dollar spent here in Australia. This is not a laughing matter, but it is a laughing matter for the ALP. - They sit there and laugh. That is their only response. This government in the meantime gets aircraft back in the sky. We have capacity back; we are servicing scheduled routes. Things are happening, and we can come through this with a bit of bipartisan support, with a bit of talking things up. The fundamentals are there. We just need a lot of confidence out there. We need to be saying that Australia is a safe place, that it is a great place to invest and that it is a great time to take a holiday.Opposition members - More!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair and place on the record my appreciation of the very strong representative work that he does on behalf of the Defence establishments within his electorate. He is a very strong advocate for Defence in this place, and that is very important for the people within his constituency. Obviously the Australian Defence Force has been looking at its various commitments in the times ahead. I am asked what impact any examination of commitments has brought about. I can advise the House that late yesterday I had advice from the Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie. That advice was in regard to both the Royal Australian Air Force's 80th anniversary Amberley air show and the centenary naval review.I advise the House that, on the advice of the CDF, the government has decided to cancel both of those events. The Amberley air show was to be held at RAAF Amberley in Ipswich, Queensland, from Friday. The centenary naval review was to be held on and around Sydney Harbour from Tuesday, 2 October to Monday, 8 October. Obviously substantial support for the RAAF air show was to be provided by the US military; in fact, their provision of support was to be a centrepiece of that air show. The government has advice that that military support is no longer available, and that is a principal reason for the Amberley cancellation. In respect of the centenary naval review, that decision has been taken by the CDF. That advice has been provided by him in the light of the RAN's involvement in existing operations and the potential for other operations in the future. Needless to say, we do have major naval commitments in the north of Australia to assist other federal agencies with the government's initiatives for intercepting illegal immigrants. I should advise the House that, in making these decisions, there has been no change in the government's publicly stated assessment of the security situation in Australia. It is also important to say that these decisions in respect of Amberley are not related in any way to CHOGM, which as members will know will proceed.I do say to the member who asked the question that the we are obviously disappointed that we are not able to proceed, and we appreciate that this will have an effect on those wishing to go to both. I think many members of the House were particularly looking forward to the naval review, which was to be a great event. We are disappointed that the events will not be proceeding, and we appreciate the impact that that may have on local businesses that were looking forward to those great occasions. When all is said and done, and when all the circumstances are taken into account, we believe that it is right and proper to give precedence to operational requirements over ceremonial matters. I have taken the advice of the CDF. That decision about those two events is obviously effective immediately.</DOC>

 - The Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services have been working overtime to get solutions to the private enterprise collapse of one company in the tourism industry. We are looking at cabotage rights for foreign carriers, we are looking at wet leasing in order to get flights happening, we are looking at Qantas and Virgin ramping up their availability of flights, and we are looking at direct financial assistance to operators to get back the capacity that was there with Ansett. We have been working bloody hard at this, and nothing has stopped our resolve to get that capacity back there. All we hear from the opposition are pretty lame contributions to the debate. There is no bipartisanship on what is a national issue - no bipartisan stance on it at all - but simply Henny Penny.</DOC>

 - Let me say that, in relation to the issues that the honourable member has raised, it is important that we send a very clear signal to those people who are involved in trafficking unlawful entrants to Australia. The fact is that they are criminals. They are trading in human beings and it is important to send a very clear red light to those who are involved in that activity. It is important that our message is clear and unambiguous. Let me make that very clear: it is important that it is unambiguous. I say that because we know the people smugglers are very conscientiously following debates here. When there was a single judge decision in relation to the Tampa, it was portrayed as a green light to them and the people they were seeking to traffic to Australia.We have implemented a range of measures. I tabled a paper yesterday that outlined fully the way in which the government is working with other countries to minimise the outflows from other areas in which people might leave. We have been organising to assist very strongly the UNHCR in bringing together countries, hopefully as early as October but certainly not as late as next year or the year after, to focus on some of the problems that are being faced in areas like Afghanistan. We are working with countries en route to disrupt the smugglers' operations and to intercept their clients while they might be travelling towards Australia. It is important to see those efforts that we have been taking internationally together with the domestic matters that we will be debating at another time. But it is important that the message that we send is not ambiguous. Part of the problem is that ambiguity does arise for a number of reasons. It arises when people see legislation that might deal with particular issues opposed, and even when they see it later supported. -  - Let me make it very clear that we welcome the belated support from Labor to a bipartisan approach on this matter. But, at the moment, what is being said is that it is being supported because `we think it is now weaker'. That is the message. - I will just go on to say that there have been mixed messages in relation to this matter, and it comes from the approach that was taken in relation to judicial review, not a matter that is being debated in this House. The fact is that, in relation to the measures that we introduced three years ago, there has been continuous opposition, but at this point when it becomes important they say, `We are now prepared to look at the judicial review bill, with amendments.' We will debate that issue in another place because the amendments, of course, would again undermine the purpose of that legislation. But what I am most concerned about are some comments that were made today in the Financial Review. The Financial Review quotes one senior Labor frontbencher on this issue as saying:People had got to the point where we were cheesed off with being wedged - and we'll fix it when we are in government.What does that mean? It means that there will never be a difference of view on immigration issues. - No. What it means is that `we will fix that when we are government'. What the Labor Party have to make very clear is that they do not mean what I read it to mean - that is, that they intend, if they were in government, to undermine the messages and the measures that we have put in place. That is what they are seeking to say: `Just wait, when we get into government we will be unwinding these measures.' That is the message that is involved. That is what is being said when you go out briefing the press in that way.</DOC>

 - All I can take from that question is that somehow the ALP opposes the payments to the Ansett workers.  -  - This government has secured entitlements for workers in situations such as what has happened with Ansett - which is a lot more than was done in the 13 years under Labor. How many companies did we see go to the wall in the late eighties and early nineties, and how many of them were paid their entitlements? We have been working strong and hard -  - We have 70 to 80 leaders from the tourism industry at our annual summit here in Canberra, and they have heard from many ministers on this side. We are engaged in debate and we are setting up a working party to start quantifying -  - This working party will be working with me on a daily basis over the next few weeks and will report directly to the Prime Minister. And I know one thing: that working party will not be coming to the government and saying, `We want higher interest rates,' they will not be saying, `We want inflation,' and they will not be saying, `We want a government budget that is so badly blown out' - as it was in 1996 - `that we have horrific bank interest rates.' We are at a time when we need good, solid, steady governance and guidance through an issue. May I remind the opposition that, at the moment, the Australian Tourist Commission is at record levels of funding when the states around the country - for all their rhetoric about how much money they will put on the table - have cut funding to tourism marketing by $10 million.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. I can report to the House that, after closing for four days, the New York Stock Exchange has now reopened for two full days of trading. After an initial fall - the largest points fall in one day's trading - the US equities markets appear to have stabilised, with the New York Stock Exchange remaining firm in its second day of trading overnight. Notwithstanding that, it is at its lowest level for some years.  The Australian stock market had anticipated falls on Wall Street. It staged a recovery after Wall Street trading and has stabilised over the course of today to around seven per cent below the level it was when the tragic terrorist events took place in New York. In addition to interest rate cuts by central banks which took place two nights ago, overnight interest rates were cut by the Bank of England and by banks in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Korea and Denmark. All of those central banks have acknowledged that this is in part to restore confidence to financial markets as a consequence of the terrorist attacks and the dislocation in New York. As I said yesterday to the House, the world economy is in a very weak state. We have a synchronised downturn in the three centres of world growth: the United States, Japan and Europe. Interest rates in Australia have not been adjusted in response to the events in New York. At its recent board meeting, the Reserve Bank had already eased policy by 25 points. As I indicated yesterday, indicators in Australia have been stronger than in the United States, Europe and Japan. Our second quarter showed a growth of 0.9 per cent, the United States showed essentially no growth in its second quarter, Japan had a contraction of 0.8 per cent, Germany showed no growth, and Canada showed no growth. In our region, Singapore has shown in the last two quarters contractions of 2.8 per cent in each of those quarters - a very significant contraction; and it is similar in Taiwan and those South-East Asian economies which are exposed principally to US exports, particularly in the ICT area.Strength in the Australian domestic economy has given us some insulation against the world downturn. I acknowledge that the member for Mallee's electorate is principally an export electorate, and I can pay tribute to Australia's exporters who, notwithstanding the global downturn, have kept Australian exports strong. This has no doubt been aided by a flexible exchange rate and the competitive state of the Australian dollar. But it has most certainly been aided by taking taxes off exports - something that could only be done as a consequence of tax reform. If we had not had tax reform, if Labor's tax policy were still in place, Labor would be taxing all of the exporters of Australia in the current downturn. One can think how exposed we would have been.Can I also say, because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition gets rather voluble on these sorts of issues: where would Australia be if our budget were still haemorrhaging with $10 billion deficits at a time like now? Yet the drive by this government to put the budget back into surplus was opposed every step of the way by the Australian Labor Party, which not only created the budget problem in Australia but fought to prevent its correction.I would not say that the world economy is out of the woods. We have no experience of a terrorist attack of this dimension and no experience to turn to to look at the outcome it will have in relation to the world economy. The world economy was already weak before this occurred. I can say that the steps that have been taken to strengthen the Australian economy are steps which will put us in much better stead than otherwise would have been the case: a sound budget position; a strengthened debt position, where we have now repaid $60 billion of Labor's debt; low interest rates; an inflation targeting policy; and a new taxation system which has given Australia's exporters a go in world markets and has given them the strength that they need to be able to compete on an equal basis with foreigners who have had that advantage for a very long period of time.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Calwell, if my memory serves me correctly, the motion that we passed did not specifically refer to a target group. But clearly there is a lot of evidence of the harbouring of Osama bin Laden by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. There are certainly very strong indications to that effect, and there is a pretty well documented association of bin Laden with terrorist activities, even apart from the latest and most atrocious of terrorist activities for 100 years and certainly within the living experience of anybody in this building today.The honourable member makes a number of assertions which I do not automatically accept. It is true that some people who seek to come to Australia illegally are Afghani. It is also true that many of them are not Afghani. There is some evidence available already that many people on the Tampa were not Afghani. In fact, there is evidence available that a significant number of them were citizens of Pakistan. In any event, what the government is seeking to establish in relation to immigration in this country is a uniform and fair assessment procedure. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has pointed out on many occasions, the reality is that the procedures that have thus far applied in Australia have resulted in an infinitely greater number of people being adjudged as entitled to refugee status than is the situation when the principles applied by the UNHCR are adopted. We seek to have a fair and balanced process whereby all of those who are entitled to be considered for the refugee places made available by Australia are judged according to the same standard and not judged according to a softer standard if you can get to Australia illegally but judged by a different standard if you have to go through the UNHCR. That seems to me, and I am pleased to note that at last it also seems to the Labor Party -  -  - Maybe until after the election. It seems to be an approach that the Labor Party themselves, for the time being -  at least perhaps for this week - regard as being appropriate. We have sought to have a fair and relatively uniform and balanced approach in relation to refugees.I also take this opportunity to say to the honourable member that this country, on my understanding, on a per capita basis takes more refugees than any country in the world except Canada. Let me say that again: more refugees on a per capita basis than any country in the world except Canada. We are one of eight or nine countries that are willing to take refugees. We have a very long and proud record of taking refugees. I can only say to the honourable member that his interest in this matter is understood -  - I do understand the concern of the honourable member in this matter. He has had a longstanding interest in these issues, and I respect the strength of feelings that he genuinely holds on these issues. I do not seek in any way to denigrate him; rather I seek to point out that what we want to do is to apply equally a set of procedures in assessment of people who want refugee status in this country. We do not want a situation where people who come here illegally can be treated more leniently than people who wait their turn. In essence, that is the principle that we have sought to uphold, and we certainly want to apply that as fairly and as humanely as possible to genuine refugees from Afghanistan and genuine refugees from other places.The other point I would make is that the honourable member for Calwell should understand that there is evidence that some people who seek to come here illegally have previously applied for refugee status and their applications have been rejected. That is the reason that they seek to come here illegally. I ask the honourable member to accept that not everybody who seeks to be an illegal immigrant to this country is automatically somebody who can qualify for refugee status. We want to have a fair, balanced and evenly applied assessment procedure, and the legislation - which I am pleased that at long last the Labor Party has indicated that it is going to accept for the time being - will in fact enable that to be facilitated. </DOC>

 - I will check exactly what I said on that date, but I will go to the second part of the Leader of the Opposition's question. As I recollect it, in the case of National Textiles the federal government put in $2 million for workers' entitlements and the New South Wales government put in $2 million. As a consequence of that, you had the result to which the Leader of the Opposition referred. If any of the state governments of Australia believe that the rest of the redundancy money that individual Ansett employees are entitled to under their industrial arrangements should also be paid, I invite them to put the money on the table to pay them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. I am very pleased to have a chance to reiterate that this government is standing shoulder to shoulder with Ansett workers in their hour of need. The government's view is that those workers are owed 100 per cent of their entitlements by Ansett-Air New Zealand. Ansett-Air New Zealand should pay those workers every last cent that they are owed. But, if Ansett-Air New Zealand cannot pay or will not pay, this government guarantees their entitlements. It guarantees 100 per cent of statutory and community standard entitlements. We will pay 100 per cent of unpaid wages, 100 per cent of annual leave, 100 per cent of long service leave, 100 per cent of pay in lieu of notice and 100 per cent of redundancy up to the community standard. On the administrator's estimates, this means that the federal government is standing behind Ansett employees to the tune of nearly $400 million. We are standing behind Ansett employees to the tune, on average, of more than $20,000 for every single employee. The government will extend, broadly speaking, the same protections to all employees who lose entitlements as a result of insolvency.I have been asked about alternative policies. On this subject, as so often on others, the opposition has more angles than Pythagoras, and none of them are acute. Last Thursday the Leader of the Opposition said:We would rather see the workers paid out of the sale proceeds from Sydney airport.The day before no less a person than the member for Batman said:We should put off the sale of Sydney airport. At the very least, there is a serious disagreement inside Labor's house of lords. Last Friday in Martin Place the Leader of the Opposition said:There is a solution. The solution is this: John Howard and this Federal Government agrees to underwrite the administrator - To make the point more vivid, he repeated it. He said:We say this: John Howard you put in place a piece of legislation or an administrative decision which for the next few weeks underwrites the operation of this airline - Just yesterday the Leader of the Opposition said:Nobody has argued that they should prop up or underwrite Ansett.Nobody has argued that except the Leader of the Opposition, the self-proclaimed nobody of the Australian parliament! On Monday, the Leader of the Opposition, blustering away on Radio 2UE, said of the Ansett collapse: This would never have happened under us.Tell that to the workers of Compass! There he was saying:This would never have happened under us.Mike Carlton said:Oh, come on. How would you stop the airline going broke?Listen to this from the Leader of the Opposition:Because we would have intervened and we would have been sitting down at a roundtable jawboning a solution.The Leader of the Opposition has been doing too much jawboning and not enough backboning. We know he has got a jawbone, but he has not got a backbone. That is precisely the problem with the Leader of the Opposition. - </DOC>

 - I do not know the details of that gentleman, but let us, for the purposes of the question, accept what the member for Brisbane is saying. I accept it for the purposes of the question. I would imagine - and I will stand corrected on this on further examination - that a significant part of the amount is made up of an above community standard redundancy. - He said, `What community standard?' I would have thought that the industrial relations spokesman for the opposition, somebody who himself has been a unionist -   -   - If the member for Brisbane wants me to simply take it on notice -  - I will make some investigation about the details of this particular gentleman's claims. But can I just go back to the kernel of what the minister for employment said: we are guaranteeing all unpaid annual leave, we are guaranteeing all unpaid salary, all salary in lieu of notice and all long service leave, and we are also guaranteeing redundancies of up to eight weeks, which is the community standard. I recognise that there will be some redundancies that will not be met under that arrangement. I recognise that, and I recognised that from the very day - last Friday - when I announced the willingness of the government to assist the Ansett workers.We take the view that if federal taxpayers' money is being put up that is a reasonable approach to take, having in mind our responsibilities to taxpayers. I would remind the member for Brisbane that, in relation to the other company he quoted, the payment made by the federal government was matched by the state government. That is the constant that the member for Brisbane and the Leader of the Opposition completely ignore. I would say again that, if members of the Australian Labor Party believe that the additional redundancies of the Ansett workers should be met by the taxpayers of Australia, I would encourage them to talk to the Premier of New South Wales and I would encourage them to talk particularly to the Premier of Victoria, because Ansett is a company which has been centred in Melbourne, and it is my understanding that, when certain approvals were given some time ago in relation to the foreign ownership exchanges in Ansett, one of the conditions of those approvals was that the company should remain centred in Australia and, effectively, therefore centred in Melbourne. So, if anybody from Victoria on the other side in this House is complaining about the inadequacy of what the government is doing -   - then I would invite them to have something to say to the Premier of Victoria and to the Premier of New South Wales and, indeed, to all of the other premiers of Australia who may think the scheme is inadequate. I also remind the member for Brisbane that, once payments have been made by the Commonwealth government, we will stand in the shoes of the individual employees and we will seek recovery from Air New Zealand. Of course, everything that we propose to do is without prejudice to the right of individual employees to recover directly from Air New Zealand the difference between what they may claim to be entitled to in relation to their full entitlements and what we have paid. Nothing will stop them from doing that, or us from standing in their shoes and doing that. When you take everything into account, what we are doing is putting $400 million on the table. I might add that the industrial friends of the member for Brisbane would not even allow my minister to tell the Ansett workers that yesterday. They would not even allow it. They are so interested in the Ansett workers -  - Take the leader of the ACTU, who will probably have preselection for a safe Labor seat in the election after next, to join the other former presidents of the ACTU: do you know what she said? She said, `Of course the minister can't speak; this is a political rally.' That is what she had to say. It was a political rally. They did not care about the Ansett workers. They were not interested. The only two people I know of who went to that gathering trying to bring some good news to the workers were the workers' friend, the Minister for Employment Services, and the friend of the tourism industry, the member for Cook. Where is he? - He is meeting with the tourism industry. I simply say to the member for Brisbane -  - I say in conclusion to the honourable member for Brisbane that, in all of the circumstances, what the federal government has done is to provide a very generous, decent, fair response to the plight of the Ansett workers and that it would be a very good idea if some state Labor governments emulated the example of the New South Wales Labor government in the National Textiles case and matched the payment made by the federal government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce, who is very concerned about the welfare of consumers in her electorate, as are a number of other members who, in all cases, have put politics aside to work out the best way to help consumers who may have purchased Ansett airline tickets with their credit cards. Obviously, consumers who have purchased tickets with their credit cards and have not been able to get a flight are legally protected. I have been in contact with the banking Ombudsman, Mr Colin Neave, and I have spoken with the chief executives of the National Australia Bank, Westpac, ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank. All the parties concerned have undertaken to be as helpful as they legally can to those affected by the collapse of Ansett. In short, consumers are entitled to a full refund after one of the following events has occurred: firstly, the time of the pre-paid flight has passed and Ansett has failed to deliver the service; or, secondly, the administrator of Ansett admits that Ansett cannot legally deliver a flight and therefore it will not be able to perform its end of the contract. Under those circumstances, consumers will receive a charge-back - that is, a full refund - to their credit card for the purchase price of their ticket. The difficulty for consumers who are expecting a full refund at the moment and have forward bookings for flights is that, in legal terms, Ansett is still alive. That means there is still a legal possibility that anyone who has bought an airline ticket for a future flight may still receive the service from Ansett. This creates certain obligations. Consumers and their banks have an obligation to pay for something they have already purchased and, in return, Ansett has an obligation to deliver the flight. However, when and if Ansett goes into liquidation and the liquidator is unwilling to provide a refund, the situation changes, and the banks have to give full credit to consumers who have purchased airline tickets with their credit cards.As the situation now stands, if Ansett customers have bought airline tickets with a credit card and the travel date has passed and they did not receive a flight from Ansett, they should contact their bank or their credit card provider and make sure that they are being refunded in full. Consumers obviously must be aware of the terms and conditions of their credit cards. But, if consumers have any concerns about the use of their credit card in the purchase of Ansett airline tickets, they should contact either their credit card provider or the banking industry Ombudsman, who has set up a hotline - and that is 1800 337444. In the meantime, the government will work with the banks and, obviously, with the banking Ombudsman to ensure that anyone who has purchased an Ansett airline ticket, has not received a flight and has used their credit card is appropriately protected.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Swan, my recollection of what I said yesterday is that it was confined to wholly owned subsidiaries of Ansett. The company you mention is not in that category and therefore the employees of that company, if that company goes into liquidation, will not get the benefit of the Ansett scheme. They will of course get the benefit of the government's scheme, which is 1,000 per cent more generous than the Labor scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question and acknowledge his background in small business. Many people on this side of the House do have a very strong background in small business and certainly have a great deal of interest in the operation of this government's initiative to protect the reservists' jobs when they go on deployment as well as to support the employers who release those employee reservists to go away on deployment or for training.Yesterday marked a milestone in that defence reserve policy when here in this parliament we were able to acknowledge the first recipient of a payment under the defence reserve support payment. Yesterday here in the parliament, the Director of South Eastern Trucks and Ag from Warragul in Victoria, Phillip Reeves, was present to share in this very important and, I believe, historic moment. South Eastern Trucks and Ag is the first company in Australia to benefit from the Commonwealth government's employer support payment. It acknowledges that, during deployment and training of a reservist, there may be hardships faced by an employer. It is important that we acknowledge that through this payment.Corporal John Bailey, an employee of South Eastern Trucks and Ag for 28 years, has been deployed to East Timor. He is the supervisor of the Force Logistics Squadron in Dili. During the ceremony yesterday we were able to view a video of Corporal Bailey at work with the Force Logistics Squadron in Dili. I think we all feel a great sense of pride in Defence Force personnel whether they are reservists on full-time deployment or full-time Defence Force personnel. Corporal Bailey knows that, as a result of this legislation which is an initiative of this government, his job will be protected and when he comes home after deployment in East Timor he will return to South Eastern Trucks and Ag. Phillip Reeves, the director of the company, and his company see the great benefit in being able to release the reservist for deployment and that the skills that they take from the civilian workplace into defence deployment are something they value. They feel that they are also making a contribution to the Defence Force of Australia and, in this case, to the operations in East Timor.We also had here yesterday Corporal Bailey's very proud family - his wife, Jenny, and son, Matthew. They watched with obvious pride as the video of Corporal Bailey working in East Timor was shown. I take this opportunity to thank the Defence Force families whether they are families of reservists, such as Jenny Bailey and the family of Corporal Bailey, or the many families of full-time service personnel who wait many long days and months for their loved ones to come back. The government acknowledges the great role that our reservists play in the capability of our Defence Force in Australia today. They represent some 42 per cent of the total force today. This allows the Defence Force, from time to time, to meet surge capacity with skills that are not always available in large numbers in the permanent force. I think we all have a great sense of pride in the operations of the Defence Force in East Timor and Bougainville and in operation gold during the Olympic Games last year.  Under this historic legislation, for the very first time in this country or any country around the world when our Defence Force reservists are deployed or have additional training to be deployed they know their jobs will be protected and their employers will receive a compensation payment for up to 78 weeks of continuous service in the Australian Defence Force. In the first couple of months of operation of this scheme, I am happy to advise the parliament that this government has paid out some $500,000. It demonstrates that the scheme is working well, produces real benefits and confirms the partnership between the government, the Australian Defence Force and reservists alike right across this country. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. The short answer to the question is: it depends on how certain planned rallies tomorrow are conducted. It depends entirely on how they are conducted.  -  - Along with other members, I have listened to and I have read the transcripts of certain interviews given this morning by the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, regarding some rallies it is planned to hold tomorrow. I would be the last person in this House to contest in any way the right of the ACTU to organise rallies, of a political or other kind. I note in relation to the Ansett situation that most of the rallies the ACTU has organised have been highly political; they have not been designed to provide Ansett employees with valuable information. I would encourage employees of the Ansett group to look in all the major newspapers today to obtain the information that the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business was denied the opportunity of giving to workers attending a rally at Parliament House two days ago.I have a very simple request to make of the ACTU: by all means organise a rally -  that is your right; it is the right of any Australian to do that - but please do it in a way that does not interfere in any way with the operations of Qantas or in any way with the operations of the airlines. The last thing this country wants at the moment is any activity which in any way interferes with people seeking to travel on Australian airlines. I would hope with the request that I have made to the ACTU that the Leader of the Opposition would join me in making that same request of the ACTU.Our position is very plain: we do not want the travelling public of Australia to suffer any further inconvenience. I say that as the leader of a government which has brought onto the table a guarantee of $400 million in entitlements of the Ansett group employees. We have brought to that particular part of this very difficult issue good faith and $400 million of guaranteed support; and, as the public advertisements indicate today in the newspapers, having guaranteed and underwritten the entitlements of the Ansett workers, we are prepared to take action - standing in their shoes, as we then would - against Air New Zealand to recover the moneys that we have outlaid on behalf of the Australian taxpayers. But I repeat: the last thing the Australian public wants at the moment is any kind of industrial activity that further inconveniences the Australian public. And I ask the Leader of the Opposition to unconditionally join me in issuing that request to the ACTU. </DOC>

 - I do not deny the right of any company, any private citizen or anyone to put material before a member of the government, a member of the back bench or a member of the opposition - anyone in this place - which plays to the case that they might want to present to us and might want us to support. - It is not true that we followed their brief. It is not true that we were sucked into some position that they wanted us to follow. The government formed a strong view and we made it very plain that we did want the alternative recapitalisation proposal for Ansett - and we always strongly supported as a first objective the recapitalisation of Ansett, and we have always said that; there was never any deviation from that position - fully explored. So it was that on 1 August I went to New Zealand and I met with Dr Michael Cullen. I found that he too felt that it was worthy of full exploration and full evaluation. We set up a process for that to happen, which was essentially New Zealand driven, but we, through our working group, two senior officials from my department, tracked that closely. There were daily teleconference calls right through the whole process. - And so it was that, with the help of the New Zealand government's negotiator, Mr Cameron, both proposals were taken forward in parallel. I can confirm to the House again, repeatedly, this simple view that in no way did the proposal that we put on the table stall the process or the decision making process. What slowed it was that the New Zealand government, as Dr Michael Cullen will confirm, could not get accurate financials and a finalisation on a strategic plan from Air New Zealand.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for asking me a question about relations with Indonesia. It is 92 days since the shadow spokesman has asked me any question at all, let alone a question about Indonesia. We are honoured to have here on the floor of the House of Representatives the Chairman of the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly, my friend Dr Amien Rais. He is enormously welcome here. He is a leading figure in Indonesia, he has been a great champion of democracy in that country, and he holds one of the leading positions in its democratic institutions. Indonesia has been through some political upheaval in recent times. Dr Rais has been one of many who have ensured that the transition of power has worked smoothly and in a constructive and democratic way. Dr Rais, Mr Speaker, as you know, is leading a parliamentary delegation here in Australia, and the delegation are sitting in the gallery. They too are enormously welcome. Everyone in this House knows that, as a result of the events in East Timor in 1999, our bilateral relationship with Indonesia went through a period of considerable strain. There is no point in ignoring or pretending that that was not the case; it was. But it is also true that our two governments recognise the great importance of each other to the future of the region and that as neighbours we should have a constructive and useful relationship built on the principles of mutual benefit and mutual respect. The nature of the relationship in recent times shows we have been able to build out of the troubled period following the events of 1999. The House will be impressed to know that we have about 18,000 Indonesian students here in Australia, and those students are very welcome in our country. Our bilateral trade in goods and services with Indonesia grew by 25 per cent in the last financial year to the largest value of trade between our two countries in history. Never has trade between Australia and Indonesia been as great as it is today, despite the difficult regional and international economic environment that we are operating in.The Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia recently, when he was the first foreign leader to meet President Megawati and her cabinet in Jakarta, was, as the House knows, a most successful visit. The subsequent visit by the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and me on 6 and 7 September was an opportunity to take the relationship further forward. There has been some focus in the media on the discussions we had about people trafficking, and they were very useful discussions. I think that that aspect of the relationship is beginning to grow quite well now. But it is also worth reminding the House that that was not the sole purpose of that visit. We also had most useful discussions with the leading economic ministers. While we were there, we met Dr Rais and other leaders in Indonesia so that, on both sides of the sea, we could understand the breadth of the relationship. This is not a relationship which is about just one or two issues; it is about a whole range of issues.In our view, it is also very important that Australia and Indonesia cooperate not just bilaterally but on multilateral issues as well. Given the tumultuous events internationally of the last 12 or so days, it is very heartening that Australia and Indonesia are amongst the countries which have very strongly condemned those terrorist attacks on the United States. I know that our countries will work together in the years ahead, not only to build trade links, people-to-people links and political links, but also to counter some of the new and very dangerous aspects of the international environment, terrorism and transboundary movements of one kind or another, be they drugs or illegal people trafficking. Those sorts of issues are going to be increasingly important, and I know that our relationship will flourish in addressing those problems.</DOC>

 - As I have said repeatedly, the government believed that the Qantas proposal deserved full evaluation and close examination. Dr Michael Cullen, the finance minister in New Zealand, believed the same thing. There is no suggestion -  there can be no suggestion - that what we did slowed up the process. It needs to be clearly remembered that right through this process until 6 September, Singapore Airlines, a shareholder in Air New Zealand and with three people at the board, had on the table their recapitalisation plan - their model for taking forward the future of Air New Zealand. They plainly believed that it was the best way forward. They obviously believed that it would secure the future of the airline.  As I have said, we indicated that we had a view that the alternative should have been closely looked at. However, the fact of the matter is that from around mid-August Dr Michael Cullen was indicating to me that, because there was no trigger for the Singapore Airlines direct investment in Ansett proposal, the New Zealand government was proceeding post haste within the time frame that we had all agreed was appropriate; that is, a decision by early September, when the group was to report publicly on its financial position - it needed certainty by then. The New Zealand government was moving to make a decision by then. We had accepted by then that, in all probability, it had to be their preferred model. There was no indication from the people who should have known best - the people around the board table, the shareholders and indeed the banks themselves - that the proposed recapitalisation model was regarded as inadequate. There was no stalling. The New Zealand minister will confirm that. What happened was that, very late in August, they started to run into difficulties agreeing amongst themselves on the recapitalisation plan. At the same time, only on 6 September, the world learned that Singapore Airlines had withdrawn its offer and that the recapitalisation plan was therefore not going to proceed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. The member for Corangamite is recognised on both sides of this House for his avid support of our government's position in the promotion of open markets and trade liberalisation across the world, but most importantly within our region, in our pursuit of multilateral agreements, regional agreements and bilateral measures.On Saturday night and Sunday I was in Hanoi, where I met with my counterparts in the Association of South-East Asian Nations to discuss the proposal for a closer economic partnership between Australia, New Zealand and ASEAN's 10 member countries. Those countries include Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma. We have made very real progress and agreed on a framework for a closer trade and economic partnership between our countries within the region. The agreement reached in Hanoi is a result of six years of work on trade facilitation and economic cooperation within our region. This is a significant step forward, providing for the first time a formal and structured approach to promoting trade, investment and regional economic integration.ASEAN is a very significant and important marketplace for Australia. The closer economic partnership encompasses economies representing a population of over 540 million people, with a combined GDP of over $A1 trillion. ASEAN accounts for 14 per cent of our total goods and services trade. Last year's exports hit a record high of $15.1 billion, with two-way trade between Australia and the ASEAN countries at $33 billion, an increase of over 35 per cent. The signing of the closer economic partnership agreement will take place at next year's meeting in Brunei between Australia, New Zealand and the 10 ASEAN countries.In announcing this, it is important that we note - as you have, Mr Speaker - the presence in the chamber today of the Indonesian delegation representing the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly and their chairman, Dr Amien Rais. We welcome Dr Rais and his delegation to our parliament. Indonesia has played a critical role in the establishment of the agreement reached in Hanoi on Sunday. Indonesia is a key member of ASEAN and through their commitment to the relationship with Australia they have certainly played a pivotal role in forging ahead with this historic agreement. Last Saturday night I had a very successful first time meeting with the new Indonesian Minister of Trade and Industry, Minister Rini Soewandi, at which we reaffirmed our commitment to working closely together within the Cairns Group, the WTO, APEC and the AFTA-CER relationship, as well as at the all important bilateral level. Australia's trading relationship with Indonesia continues to flourish, with two-way trade in goods and services growing by 25 per cent last year, now standing at $7.8 billion - the largest two-way trade figure ever between the two nations. It needs to be recorded that this has come as a result of a lot of hard work that has been done by both the Australian side and the Indonesian side in recent years to ensure the health of our bilateral relationship.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. Obviously, Australia faces the question of terrorism, both amongst its neighbours and around the world, and will be making a contribution on the military and foreign affairs front to combat terrorism wherever it arises. But, in relation to economic issues, I report to the House that overnight the New York Stock Exchange fell further. It is now approximately 8.8 per cent below the level that it was prior to the terrorist attacks in New York. During today, most of the Asian stock exchanges have fallen, including some falls on the Australian stock exchanges. The good news is that oil prices seem to have stabilised overnight and have actually returned to levels lower than what they were prior to the terrorist attacks. Whilst that will be good news for economies and the petrol price, it does no doubt reflect to some degree an assessment that world growth will be slower and demand for oil lower. As a consequence, the price of oil has come off.I have already informed the House that the US economy had stopped growing prior to these terrorist attacks. There will be immediate damage to American airlines and insurance, and second round effects in relation to consumer and business confidence. Here in Australia we had a strong growth quarter in June of 0.9 per cent, stronger than the United States, Japan and Europe. Our interest rates are as low as they have been in the last 30 years and, with accommodative interest rates, there is no reason for consumers to interrupt their buying patterns. I make that point very carefully: there is no reason for consumers to interrupt their expenditure patterns. There is nothing that has changed in an underlying sense. Monetary policy is still very accommodative and there continues to be robust growth in the housing industry.I am also asked what effect this is likely to have on Australia's budget position. Plainly, new pressures are now coming to bear on our budget position which were not anticipated in May. Of the three pressures that are coming, the first is the number of unauthorised boat arrivals. The measures that the government has had to take, including additional patrolling in the waters off the territorial sea, will lead to larger expenditures than was the case as expected at the time of the budget.  -  - The suggestion that Australia should spend $2 billion building a coastguard is laughable. It is the kind of laughable proposition that the now Leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Finance - and he was not much of a minister for finance - had the logic to reject when he was in government. To have suggested that a coastguard would in some way compensate for the patrol of Australian naval vessels off the territorial sea is laughable. It is a laughable proposition. - No, you're truly hilarious. The Leader of the Opposition says, `The US is truly hilarious.' No; as it turns out, you are. That is the proposition. The second point in relation to expenditures is that obviously Australia's contribution to the allied military response to terrorism will bring with it costs. Until Australia's contribution is known it will not be possible to actually quantify that in budgetary terms. The third budget pressure is in regard to the government's commitment to ensure that Ansett employees' entitlements are protected. The government anticipates that up to $400 million may be required in order to justify those entitlements. The government will be putting in place a $10 ticket levy to guarantee the Ansett employees' payments. We welcome the fact that the Labor Party has indicated it will be supporting that levy. -   - The Leader of the Opposition just interjected, `Yes, we will support it.' So we welcome the fact that the opposition has just committed itself to the support of the $10 levy. - We take it therefore that the policy in relation to the ticket levy is a bipartisan one and will not be attacked; therefore -  - The Leader of the Opposition said he will be supporting it but now quibbles with the fact that it is bipartisan. He either supports it or he does not. He either flips or he flops. We would like to know whether it is the flip or the flop, quite frankly. And we would like to know whether the flip or the flop can hold his position for a week on this occasion. He could not hold his position for a week on border protection. Can he hold his position for a week in relation to a $10 levy? He has indicated to this House he will be supporting it. That being the case, we welcome the fact that this is now a bipartisan position in support of the Ansett employees. He has said quite clearly - it will be on the Hansard record -  that he is supporting it, and whilst he continues to support it we welcome his bipartisan position. It is important, of course, in relation to protecting those Ansett employees that we do underwrite those entitlements. This is the government that has a scheme to meet them. It will go through with that levy and, if the Labor Party can support that levy as the Leader of the Opposition has indicated, we will welcome it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because a great deal has been said about the appropriate form of words I as the federal minister for tourism should or should not have used to describe the collapse of Ansett. I admit that in a radio interview yesterday I used some words to describe how I hoped that the Ansett collapse would be remembered in the broad -  -  - Those words could have been better chosen, and I admit that. But ever since the collapse of Ansett -  -  - Ever since the Ansett collapse and the tragic events in the United States, I as the tourism minister and this government have been coming to terms with the scale and consequences of last week, and there are some very troubling stories coming out such as the drying up of cash flow and the effect on businesses normally very heavily dependent on air traffic. Some of these businesses are facing some incredible challenges, especially coming out of a winter trading period where business has been slow when they were expecting a brighter September holiday period leading into a bumper Christmas. My colleague the Deputy Prime Minister has been working exceptionally hard at getting capacity back into the skies, and he is in the best position to update - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. I did inform the House earlier this week of some of the measures the government had taken to support the United States at this difficult time, including the invocation of ANZUS, the deployment of Anzac in the Persian Gulf and the exchange of personnel in units in the US. We have taken some additional measures. As a result of a request from US Central Command, we have extended the deployment of Anzac for a few more days through to 3 October. That will assist the US in maintaining the multinational interception force presence in the Gulf without interruption while newly arrived US warships complete their familiarisation training. The government will also consider options in due course to provide a follow-on vessel to replace HMAS Anzac based on US requirements.The government has also now agreed to the deployment of ADF exchange personnel currently attached to UK forces as part of coalition NATO counter-terrorist response operations. The UK and NATO have both given support to the conduct of US-led counter-terrorist operations. ADF personnel are currently deployed on a range of exchange positions within the UK's forces. We have approximately 44 ADF personnel deployed on long-term exchanges and they perform a variety of duties, combat and combat support related activities, including service on UK naval vessels, aircrew and support personnel with operational RAF squadrons and Army personnel deployed in a range of different combat functions within the British Army. We also have a further 112 ADF personnel currently attached to UK units as part of Exercise Long Look 2001, which is an annual short-term triservice exchange.I had previously informed the House that RAAF personnel on exchange with US forces had been involved in flying combat air patrols over continental United States. I had a brief this morning to say that is not true, that is not right. I can update the House that we did have two pilots tasked and available for that, but at relatively short notice there were changes to operational requirements. That does underline the fact that the exchange personnel we have are allocated to their units, whether with the US or with the UK, and they are under the operational command of those units.Naturally enough, the information that we have about their activities is likely to be spasmodic, as the information as to those activities from an operational point of view will be subject to operational security requirements within their commands, either within the US or the UK. We are obviously very interested in and keen to know the activities of any Australians, wherever they might be serving, but the information that is available to us is sometimes limited or sketchy, as has happened in this particular case. Obviously we will attempt to keep the House and families as best advised as we can. But I think it is important for the House to know that we have Australians in a number of units, both in the UK and the US. They could be deployed overseas and they would do so within those command units.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and acknowledge the very real importance of the aviation industry to her electorate, given that the regional centre of Wagga has a significant number of people employed in the aviation industry, and the very real interest she has in ensuring that the industry gets back on its feet as quickly as possible. The government is in almost hourly contact with the Ansett administrator, seeking to do everything we can to facilitate the restoration of flights everywhere. In view of the other very serious issue now confronting aviation here and internationally, we are also in consultation with Qantas and others in relation to indemnity insurance. That is going to be something that governments everywhere are going to have to grapple with, in common with the airline industries. Indeed, right across the world the sector faces extraordinary difficulties and, as always, we will seek to work with the industry in a constructive way. Of course, we are also working with the Ansett administrator to pay employees' entitlements as they fall due - a $400 million commitment, and a very important one. I do not think it would be unreasonable to ask the union movement in this country to actually acknowledge that this is being done - to acknowledge that it was never envisaged as something that the ALP might have done when they were in power. Their attempts to ensure that workers do not have access to this information is a very real problem. - I will not be drawn into that debate with the Leader of the Opposition, who again wants to say that it is the government's fault that Air New Zealand has driven an Australian company into the ground. I want to come to the issue of regional air services. They continue to be restored. Qantas announced yesterday that it was adding Mount Isa to its network, with 12 non-stop flights a week. A service from Sydney to Parkes and Broken Hill was restored yesterday and a service to Merimbula and Moruya on the New South Wales South Coast is under way today.I am indebted to the ADF. They have a lot on their plate at the moment. For very good reasons in the national interest, they are operating at a very high level of activity and their resources are significantly deployed in a number of areas, as we all know. There are 300 Aboriginal children from the Broome region who would have been stranded in the boarding schools they attend in Perth and surrounding areas. The RAAF has put in place arrangements to return those children to their homes in the Broome region during the school holidays, which will be very widely welcomed.In a further welcome development, the administrator of Hazelton Airlines has been approached by potential buyers for that airline. I have instructed my portfolio agencies to fast-track in every way possible any requests that might be made, regulatory or otherwise. If they want access to our rapid regional route recovery program, we will certainly make that available. In the true spirit of bipartisanship, I am delighted to say that I have just been informed that the New South Wales government has provided a loan which should enable the resumption tomorrow of some Hazelton services in New South Wales. I welcome that. That is a good thing. There has been a little bit of flak out of the New South Wales Labor government recently suggesting that we have not been committed to regional aviation services in New South Wales. In fact, recently the New South Wales government cut $50,000 - that was all - out of taxes and charges that they impose on regional air services in New South Wales -  $50,000 across the board, not in one area -  and claimed that as a great victory. It is worth remembering that this government has reduced Labor's 17c a litre excise on avgas to 2c a litre. That is a huge tax reduction on regional aviation. And what we have done in terms of the slots at Sydney airport also demonstrates a very real commitment to regional aviation in New South Wales. I am delighted to note that today's Queensland Country Life carries the banner headline `Anderson gets bush flying' - very welcome recognition. We have actually been working around the clock since we learnt of the very serious situation we would be facing, whereas all the ALP has done is jawbone. They have not provided leadership anywhere. We await just a little bit of leadership on one issue: will the Leader of the Opposition talk to the ACTU and say, `We're concerned about tourism; we're concerned about jobs; we're concerned about people being able to move around for their business and personal plans over the next little while, and we think that now is not a very sensible time to risk interruption to our aviation services'? We seek just that little bit of leadership. All we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition to this point in time is jawboning.   - That is all we have seen. - Mr Speaker -  - Mr Speaker, I just want to make the point that that is one positive, concrete action - in the face of the total absence in this debate of useful contributions and useful and workable ideas and the empty rhetoric - that the leader of the ALP might be able to actually take in this situation.In conclusion, I would like to make the point that, in all of this, workers and the ACTU ought to recall that it was not simply that when the ALP were in power for 13 years they did nothing about workers' entitlements; it was that they adopted a very ruthless hands-off, `we don't care' attitude when workers lost their jobs. The evidence for this was in the Compass collapse of 1990. The Leader of the Opposition said something in here the other day that I thought was very illustrative. He said, `Oh, there were only a thousand employees affected' - only a thousand; that is all there were, so they did not matter. In other words, might is right - if there are a thousand employees it does not matter. I think that is an abhorrent principle. It is also worth recalling that, at that time, Paul Keating had just come to power and the government were insisting that they would not do anything -  - I just want to read from the transcript. I want to record what Bob Collins, the Minister for Transport at that time, said in relation to taxpayers helping out private companies that fell over. He said:I don't think the taxpayers would be too delighted with us if we'd handed $30 million of their money, because that is what we were asked for, over to Brian Grey last week or bought $18 million worth of prepaid seats on his airlines. I think they would be extremely unhappy with us.That was the Labor Party's attitude then when they had to make responsible decisions considering their responsibilities to the taxpayer and to the community. It stands in stark contrast to the empty but opportunistic rhetoric which we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition in the last 10 days.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Such issues of patient transport would normally be the responsibility of the other eight health ministers around Australia and six state -  - It is not something which is in the province of the Commonwealth. However, if any of the states put propositions to me, I would look at them sympathetically.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his interest in the welfare of more than five million Australians who participate in frequent flyer schemes and similar reward programs. Mr Speaker, as I have previously advised the House, nothing in relation to these schemes is free. At the end of the day, consumers pay for frequent flyer points either in higher prices for goods purchased or through higher credit card fees. For many Australians, their accrued frequent flyer points are a very valuable and important asset. With Ansett being placed into administration, many consumers are asking whether their accrued points retain value. Each consumer should contact their credit card provider or their bank for more details because the contractual obligations vary.From time to time in this place we do have a shot at the banks, and often it is with good justification; however, when a financial institution does the right thing, it should also be acknowledged. In this case, around 600,000 Australians are part of Westpac's Global Rewards scheme with Ansett. They have faced some confusion following Ansett being placed into administration. However, Westpac have responded quickly to unfolding events by confirming that they stand behind the Westpac Visa rewards scheme, which will continue to operate even though it is still unclear whether the points will be -  - The Visa reward scheme will continue to operate, even though it is still unclear whether the points will be redeemable with Ansett. However, those 600,000 Australians can continue to accrue points and they may be redeemed in other ways. It is also important to note that, in this case, Westpac has cut the interest rate on the affected cards by two per cent, until a new reward program is announced. In addition it has delayed the payment of the annual fee on affected reward cards until a new program is announced. So this is a good and responsible approach by a particular bank. We would like to see other banks and other credit card providers respond accordingly.The ACCC is investigating the frequent flyer programs across Australia. In July the ACCC extended its investigation to also look at the overall promotion of frequent flyer and reward schemes and, in particular, bottleneck destinations and the availability of seats for frequent flyers. Obviously, given the events of the last two weeks, the ACCC has advised me that it will need to reassess its investigation. However, I can assure the House that the government and industry will continue to work very hard together to ensure that, as far as possible, consumers are supported while the problems at Ansett are addressed. </DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question, because it is a very general question and it does allow me to say a number of things about Australia's economic performance.  - The Australian economy, by any measure, has been performing above the level of the performance of other comparable economies for a very long time. - The Australian economy's growth trajectory, until the tragic events of last week, was better than had been predicted at the time the budget was brought down. We have heard a lot from the opposition about jobs over the past few days. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that, in the time the government has been in office, we have generated almost 900,000 new jobs. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that, by the end of this financial year, on current projections we will have paid back $58 billion of the $96 billion of government debt you left us. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that we now enjoy the lowest levels of interest rates that are of ongoing benefit to business as well as to home owners that we have had for a period of more than 30 years. - The Leader of the Opposition talks about the impact of the GST. Has the Leader of the Opposition forgotten that, in relation to our current account deficit and our trade performance over the last year, we have achieved near record levels. In fact, our current account deficit for the past quarter is, I understand, the best current account performance for 20 years, since 1981. That is due to a number of factors, and one of those factors is that we have removed indirect taxes completely from the cost of exports. If you look at the performance of the Australian economy up until the tragic events of last week, it is the best performance of the Australian economy since the late 1960s. One of the many reasons why the Australian economy has performed so well is that this country for the last 5½ years has had a government that has had the courage to introduce necessary economic reforms, despite a pattern of almost guerilla opposition from the Australian Labor Party. At every turn, the Labor Party have endeavoured to frustrate the reform agenda of this government. I cast my mind back to the time when the former Labor government were in office. On those occasions when they acted in the national interest - such as in relation to financial deregulation or the reduction of tariffs or, dare I remind the Leader of the Opposition, the privatisation of government enterprises, which he would not have been able to achieve without the support of the then opposition; remember the 12½ per cent broad based consumption tax that you championed in 1986? - the fact is that the Labor Party faced an opposition that was prepared to act in the national interest.  - He talks about the Pasminco workers. I will come to the Pasminco workers in just a moment. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, when you were in government and you put up an idea that was in the national economic interest, we supported it. In the time that we have been in government, whenever we have put up a proposition that has been in the national economic interest of Australia, the Labor Party, for their own short-term cheap political interests, have opposed it. Labor opposed industrial relations reform, they opposed the government's reforms in relation to Telstra, they opposed taxation reform, they opposed Work for the Dole, they opposed for a long time the proposals the government had in relation to illegal immigration and now they are threatening, even though they support it at the moment, that if they happen to win the election they will change the law. That is the measure of the hypocrisy and the neglect of the national interest of the Leader of the Opposition. By way of interjection, I was asked about the workers at Pasminco. Presumably that is a reference to the entitlements of those workers. - It is about their jobs and their entitlements. In relation to their employment position, the latest advice I have is that the company is continuing to operate. In fact, over lunch I happened to see an interview with the receiver. He indicated that all the operations of the company were going on. I also inform the House that last night the chairman of the company, Mr Mark Rayner, rang me prior to the statement being issued about the receivership to inform me that it was going into receivership. The first question I asked him was about the security of employment and, potentially, entitlements. He assured me that there were adequate provisions within the finances of the company to cover any entitlements. If that is the case, that is an approach and a degree of commercial prudence and responsibility that I would commend to all Australian companies. That is the view also expressed by the receiver.I also refer to a letter written by the chief executive officer on 12 September to my colleague Senator Nick Minchin, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. The letter said:It is difficult to envisage any circumstances in which employee entitlements are at risk even in the unlikely event of insolvency.In other words, let me say immediately that, on the basis of the information I have been given - I repeat: that is the basis of my statement - and on the basis of the claims made publicly by the receiver and in this letter by the managing director of the company, any attempt by the Labor Party to run a fear campaign in relation to the entitlements or the security of employment of the employees of Pasminco is one that could be completely rejected. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that, although he finds the reality of it very difficult to accept - despite all of the attempts made by the Labor Party over the last five years to stop this economy expanding, to stop this government reforming the economy, to stop this government doing the things for the Australian economy that are in the national interest - this nation, economically, has performed extremely well. This country has performed better than anybody expected. This country has outperformed most other countries.Our future is bound to be affected by the events of last week. As both the Treasurer and I have said repeatedly over the past few days, in the light of what occurred last week and the consequences of it which are now being played out on financial markets, in world airlines and in so many other areas, there are certainly clouds over the future economic growth of all nations. The comforting thing for Australia is that, because of what the government has done over the last 5½ years, we are better prepared to deal with those problems than any other nation. We are better prepared than any other nation.I know that right through the front ranks of the Labor Party, starting with the Leader of the Opposition and the deputy leader, it is a reality they do not like to face. But whatever lies ahead of this country economically, one thing can be asserted with total confidence: because of what we have done -   - this nation is better prepared than any to deal with anything that the future may throw at us. - </DOC>

 - The government's swift response to the Ansett crisis has been to guarantee the statutory and community standard entitlements of Ansett workers. It is the government's view that Ansett-Air New Zealand should pay those workers every last cent that they are owed. But, if they cannot, the government guarantees 100 per cent of unpaid wages, 100 per cent of annual leave, 100 per cent of long service leave, 100 per cent of pay in lieu of notice and 100 per cent of the community standard redundancy, which is eight weeks. - The government has also improved the general entitlements scheme. All employees will receive entitlements and protections at the same level as Ansett workers, except that payout levels will be capped at a salary rate of $75,000 a year. This new and improved general entitlements scheme will ensure that 90 per cent of employees or more get 100 per cent of their entitlements in the event of their employer's insolvency.I have been asked about alternative policy. Let us just look at some of the alternative policy from the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to saving airlines in trouble. When he was a minister and Compass went belly up, with the loss of 1,000 jobs - and those workers got no protection of entitlements whatsoever - Brian Gray, the head of Compass, said:I went to the government on Wednesday and I asked for some relief. Kerin, Beazley and Collins came in and sat down and before I even opened my mouth, Kerin simply said there could be no cooperation from the Commonwealth government. He said, `Under no circumstances will we help you by any means.'In those days, when the Leader of the Opposition had responsibility, he was against bailing out airlines. - Last Friday he went to Martin Place and said:We - that is, the ALP - say this: John Howard you put in place a piece of legislation or an administrative decision which for the next few weeks underwrites the operation of this airline ...Last Friday he thought that you should bail out airlines, and then yesterday he came into the House and said:I have been misrepresented by the Minister ... who claimed ... I had suggested that the government should underwrite Ansett Airlines. I have never suggested that at any stage. This is not a skit from Clarke and Dawe. These are the official statements of the would-be Prime Minister of this country. The basic problem is that this bloke cannot handle pressure. Let us listen to what he told his biographer as to the reason why he could not face reading the newspapers of a morning. This is the Leader of the Opposition to his biographer: ... if you think you're under attack you do not want to leave yourself psychologically damaged, as it's already hard enough to face the day.This is what he thinks - ... particularly when you get into leadership positions, you're just reeling from the punches all the time ...This is the Leader of the Opposition's problem. He is all talk and no ticker; he is all jawbone and no backbone. The Australian people will always take the view: no ticker, no start.</DOC>

 - I am sure that everyone in this House would agree that we want an as strong as possible entry of new, commercial players in Australia's aviation market out of the present very unfortunate process. There are a few points that need to be made. Firstly, it is a false hope offered by the ACTU and their spokespeople in this place, I believe, to try to pretend that Ansett, as it was, can go back into the skies. I am sorry to have to say that, but the reality is that, even as we speak, the administrator is still unable to ascertain the full extent of the financial position that the group was left in. Indeed, it strikes me as more than a little unusual that the ACTU, whose great commercial experience runs to petrol stations and department stores, can pretend that you can put an airline back into the skies, when Air New Zealand could not do it, when Singapore Airlines could not do it, when Qantas could not do it and when two administrators have said that its position is so serious that they are still seeking to get to the bottom of it. I cannot quite work out the Leader of the Opposition's position. One moment he wants us to underwrite it and then he does not want us to underwrite it. The next minute he wants us to put in public money and then he does not want us to put in public money. The lack of leadership here is quite mind-boggling. According to AAP, under the heading `Beazley calls for money to get Ansett', at 1.38 this afternoon the Leader of the Opposition went out there and said that the ALP had called for a $200 million government cash injection to help get failed airline Ansett back off the ground. Now, with this retrospective leadership, those opposite are back into putting taxpayers' money into Ansett. - He said that, in the face of likely debts of $2 billion, $200 million can get Ansett, as it was, back in the sky. That is the ACTU's peddling of false hopes. The fact of the matter is that we have worked very closely to do everything we can on a wide range of fronts, and the administrator is working very hard to ensure the strongest possible new aviation entrants into the Australian trunk routes and beyond. Whether or not one will wear the badge of Ansett, we do not know. The suggestion that $200 million can somehow do what nothing else has been able to do is absurd. I think the only other point that needs to be established quite clearly is this: as the Minister for Finance and Administration would acknowledge, the sale of Sydney airport would be a debt reduction measure and the funds, as such, would not be available for an exercise of the sort that the Leader of the Opposition has proposed this afternoon.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I can inform the House that, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States, global aviation insurers took action late last week to significantly lift premiums on insurance policies offered to carriers and also to reduce to unacceptably low levels the amount of cover that would be available for third party damage. As a result of those decisions, every airline in the world faced a situation that, under the new aviation insurance arrangements, there would be cover in relation to third party damage, both death and bodily injury, and also property damage of $US50 million in total in any one year.It would be quite apparent to the House that that was, in today's world, an unacceptably low level of cover. We were approached by Qantas on Friday - and, of course, what I am about to say is of equal applicability to any other carrier in Australia; that is something of which they are aware and I will make that apparent in a moment -  and the indication was that, unless some arrangement could be made at least on a temporary basis for the government to provide an indemnity, we faced the prospect that all major airline operations domestically in Australia and emanating from Australia by Qantas could in fact have ceased. As a result of those approaches, the government decided over the weekend and I announced on Saturday afternoon that we would provide third party war, including terrorism and hijacking, indemnity cover beyond that provided under the new aviation insurance arrangements. The commitment of the government is third party cover for surface damage of up to $US5 billion. It will be rolled over on a monthly basis, and it is available for all Australian aviation carriers that approach the government and have aircraft with 15 or more seats. In the event that there are similar war insurance problems with smaller aircraft, the government will consider providing indemnities to these Australian airline carriers as well.I can inform the House that already Qantas, Virgin Blue and the Ansett administrator have approached the government to take up the government's offer and that indemnity contracts for these carriers will be completed by 9 a.m. tomorrow, 25 September. The International Air Transport Association has written to all national governments seeking governments' commitments to directly indemnify national carriers for third party property and casualty liability claims. As a result of the action that we have taken, we have responded to that request of the International Air Transport Association, and we have shored up our code share arrangements with foreign carriers. In the absence of that announcement there had been warnings of UK and US based airlines ceasing services to Australia. Informal advice we have received, initially from the United States, is that this prospect has now significantly receded as a result of the action that has been taken by the government. It is an unusual indemnity for the government to provide but we are in unusual circumstances. I stress that it is an indemnity equally available to any airline other than Qantas. It has already been the subject of an application by the Ansett administrator; therefore, if there were to be at some time in the future a form of the former Ansett airline in the air, they would be covered as equally as would Qantas. Virgin Blue has already made a similar application. While I am on my feet, can I say that the government remains hopeful that the discussions that have now been going on very intensely between the Ansett administrator and Qantas for the wet leasing of a number of airbuses can be satisfactorily concluded. I make no secret of the fact that I spent some time over the weekend urging the parties to resolve their differences. This is a situation where, in the national interest, there has to be some give and take on both sides - both on the side of the administrator and on the side of Ansett - because, in the end, our responsibility as a government is to the travelling public.I know that in the course of this debate remarks have been made about the contribution the government has made. I would remind the House that we have already guaranteed up to $400 million of workers' entitlements for the Ansett employees. In the circumstances I have just outlined we have picked up a contingent liability of up to $A10 billion in relation to third party property damage. We will continue to monitor the discussions between Qantas and the administrator. Although capacity utilisation is very high, and the indications are that on the trunk routes the arrangements put in place since the Ansett grounding have gone a long way towards meeting the market, and there have not been quite as many gaps in availability of seats as was predicted at the time, it is nonetheless the case that we have an overriding responsibility to do what we can to help the Australian public secure seats when they want them. That puts an obligation on Qantas. It puts an obligation on the Ansett administrator. It is a case where, in the national interest, the differences they might have over matters which in the long run are not of enduring significance should be the subject of compromise in the interests of the travelling public. I ask both of the parties to redouble their efforts to reach an agreement. The victor out of that will be the travelling Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question and recognise the intense interest she has shown in the tragedy of 11 September and the ensuing events over the last nearly two weeks. The number of Australians confirmed dead still remains at three, and it now appears that no more than 20 Australians were in the World Trade Centre at the time of the attacks and were unable to escape before the building collapsed.We are, nevertheless, continuing our efforts to account for a further 10 Australians who were the subject of calls to my department immediately after the attacks and whom we have still not been able to track down. From that, people should not automatically conclude the worst, because we had those numbers up to around 90 at one stage and progressively people have been contacted.The government is determined to support the families of the victims at this intensely difficult time. I have made special arrangements in this unprecedented situation to cover the costs of travel to New York for two members of each family of those Australians believed to have died in the attacks. Our Consul General in New York, Ken Allen, and his team continue to help Australians who have been traumatised by the crisis, and he is currently assisting some families already in New York with both accommodation arrangements and counselling.The honourable member also asked about the steps the government has taken in response to the terrorist attacks. Firstly, maybe fortuitously but with a good deal of foresight about the importance of intelligence, the government increased the budget of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service by 23 per cent in this year's budget. Secondly, I have directed the establishment of an antiterrorism task force in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide advice on the international aspects of the government's response to the attacks. This task force will act as the main point of liaison and coordination with foreign governments on antiterrorism issues. I have also directed that a comprehensive review of security arrangements at all Australian diplomatic and consulates overseas be undertaken and asked that all emergency consular contingency plans be revised in the light of the changed international circumstances following the attacks on America. Now that these reviews have been completed - and they were completed just at the end of last week - I believe that we are better placed to assist Australian citizens in emergencies. All information and advice provided to Australian travellers has been revised through our consular advice notification system, and I would ask all Australians who are planning to travel overseas - and many have contacted both my office and, for that matter, contacted me at home - to please consult that travel advice before confirming their travel plans. The international situation is an unfolding situation and it is very important that Australians keep in touch with the consular advice which is available on the web site, through my department or through our embassies and consulates overseas.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Plainly it would have been infinitely preferable if the parent group's management of Ansett had not left it in such a diabolical financial position. No-one takes any joy in this; no-one -  except those who would seem to want to gloat over what they might see as the political opportunities in it - would see this as anything other than a very unfortunate happening. There is a very important point that I want to make out of this. If there is one thing I do not believe in, it is offering false hope to those who are facing a serious situation. That is precisely what the ACTU, and particularly Sharan Burrow, is doing. That is what they are up to.Plainly we want the administrator to enjoy every possible opportunity to ensure the strongest possible new entrants into the aviation market in this country. That is what we want. The Leader of the Opposition is again taking positions in retrospect: one moment he is for injecting money, the next he is against and now he has a very vague proposal to put $150 million to $200 million into an outfit whose true financial position is still unknown - the administrator says it is just like peeling back layers of an onion. It keeps getting worse. Given that situation, I do not know how the Leader of the Opposition proposes to simply write off a couple of billion dollars worth of debt. Where is that money owed to secured creditors and others going to come from, if suddenly, magically, this airline can rise from the ashes? We all wish it could happen, but in the end we all have to deal with realities. The realities are that the administrator is charged with a difficult and very important task on behalf of Ansett workers and the travelling public of this country, and the solutions that you put up, which vary by the day, are non-solutions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for the question because it gives me an opportunity on behalf of the government to utterly condemn what appears to be an act of arson and of mindless destruction of a mosque in Queensland. There have been other reported incidents of attacks on mosques not only in Queensland but elsewhere, of attacks on members of the Islamic community, including the pelting of buses with rocks and bottles, and of assaults on Australians. Such behaviour is totally unacceptable. There is no reason for it. If it is in any way linked with the tragedy that has occurred in the United States, it is a linkage in people's mind that is not appropriate and should not be made. Those tragic events in the United States of America have taken the lives of not only Australians but also, as I understand it, as many as 1,700 Muslims. Insofar as I am aware, no suggestion has been made in any of the reports that I have seen that any linkages with Australians or with Australia have been made with what has happened in the United States.In that context, there is no place in Australia for vilification of any Australians because of those tragic events. All Australians, whether they are Muslim, Christian, Jewish or otherwise, are entitled to express their religious views and their places of worship are entitled to respect. You cannot expect a tolerant view of your own personal views to be given if you cannot give others that same entitlement. One of the strengths of our society has been that we have brought together many people of different cultures and different religions from all over the world, and we have been able to demonstrate that people can live together successfully. The Prime Minister has expressed his own views in relation to this matter, making it clear that such behaviour is abhorrent to him and to the government. I know that the member for Moreton has visited the mosque, as have many representatives of the community, including representatives from the Catholic, Mormon and Uniting churches, and they have offered their support to the Muslim community in Queensland. I know from the honourable member for Moreton that those expressions of support have been very welcome to the Islamic community in his electorate.On Friday I visited the mosque at Preston. I went there because I was otherwise in Melbourne, and I met with Sheikh Fehmi and members of the community and expressed these same views to them. I intend to continue to visit Islamic communities around Australia. I will visit the Brisbane community early next week, and I will convey to them the government's concern and support for them. I know that the Prime Minister is very much involved in this; he spoke on the phone to Sheikh Fehmi. We will certainly ensure that the very strongly held views that we have here in Australia of respect for diversity and of the strength of the community are well understood and known, and we will continue to give support to those members of our community who experience any form of vilification.</DOC>

 - I inform the House that any airline customer who has paid for a ticket and not received a service is entitled to a refund in respect of the full price, including the GST, because the GST is included in the price. So, if you get a refund of the ticket, you get a refund of the GST, which is included in the price. -  - I also inform the House that businesses which do not receive a service are entitled to reverse the transaction. A reversal of the transaction means that no GST on a service which has not been performed is payable and an input tax credit cannot be claimed, so you have the capacity for a reversal. I am afraid to inform the Labor Party that, regrettably, their attempts to be opportunistic in relation to Ansett have failed on this occasion.In relation to these matters, the normal rules of taxation would apply, in much the same way as they did in relation to wholesale sales tax. I do not recall the Australian Labor Party having specific provisions in wholesale sales tax acts which said that, in the event that wholesale sales tax had been paid on a good and there was not performance, you could come to the tax commissioner and get it back. I do not recall the Australian Labor Party putting such provisions in their acts. I do not recall that being the case.But the thing you always know about the Australian Labor Party is this: if there is an opportunity for a cheap opportunistic point, not only will the Labor Party try and take it but the old member for Hotham will be in the forefront. We do not regard this as a serious question in relation to taxation: yet more attempts to try and profit from a management failure in relation to Ansett Airlines where the Australian Labor Party -  - More attempts by the Australian Labor Party to try and profit out of the misfortune of the Ansett employees -  simply that. Is this a serious question about taxation? Was there a provision in the wholesale sales tax acts for reversals? No, of course there was not; it was never considered in all of the 70 years of wholesale sales tax. Is there a genuine concern about Ansett? No, of course there is not. Is there a genuine concern about taxation policy? No, of course there is not. A cheap, opportunistic opposition, led by a member who is not qualified in relation to taxation matters, is trying to make political capital - and it ought to be treated by the employees with the disdain that it deserves. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I think that question is best answered by stating that to have a ready and capable defence force requires a sustained commitment of resources, time and effort over a period of time. In respect of the Australian Defence Force, the government has in recent years invested that time and effort to build on this and to ensure high levels of readiness and capability generally within the Defence Force. When the government was first elected back in 1996, for example, we quarantined Defence from expenditure cuts across government. We initiated a major reform program for Defence, with one of its objectives being to improve the teeth-to-tail ratio of Australia's Defence Force. When we were elected in 1996 the teeth-to-tail ratio - namely, that balance of forces between combat and combat support and administration - was 42 per cent. Today the teeth-to-tail ratio is 62 per cent - well on the way to the target of 65 per cent which the government has set.In the 12 months or so leading up to December last year, the government went further and built on its earlier reforms by a process of consultation and careful consideration to a long-term plan for Defence which culminated in the release of the Defence white paper last year. That document provides for the future for Defence by way of resources, continuation of the reform program and a range of other matters which are set out in that white paper. One of the important elements of the white paper was the recognition that we ought to structure our Defence Force to give the government of the day as many options as was reasonable within the limits of financial resources and the like, so that the government of the day could respond to a myriad of possibilities and scenarios in the future. In doing so, there were some important decisions taken in the white paper which I think are worthy of some comment.Firstly, the budget for special forces has been increased in the white paper from $360 million in the current year to $442 million over the decade - a substantial increase in real terms. It was also recognised by Defence that we needed to have some greater emphasis and resources in the intelligence area. I should say in commenting on this that, of course, Defence is not the only agency involved in intelligence, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to a significant increase in intelligence within his portfolio in the resources allocated. In terms of Defence, though, we have in the white paper an increase there from $451 million, increasing to $565 million over the decade, with enhanced signals intelligence and imagery collection capabilities, improved intelligence processing and dissemination systems, and deeper levels of cooperation with the United States intelligence agencies in some key areas.It is also appropriate to refute some comments in the Australian Financial Review today, which claimed that a senior member of the ADF had said words to the effect that there was a lack of suitable equipment and an inappropriate defence strategy. As some indication of the credibility of that report, the person who wrote the article did not actually attend the seminar where the words were claimed to have been said. At no stage did Defence officials suggest a lack of suitable equipment and an inappropriate defence strategy. The officer concerned did comment that, in instances where industry fails to deliver projects according to contracted schedule, it may limit Defence's ability to offer options to government. He did not offer examples and did not make any statements regarding Australia's ability or otherwise to provide particular military support to the US. I can say categorically that Australia is able to offer a wide range of aerospace capabilities, including combat capabilities, should these be needed. The fact is that we have an efficient Defence Force -  - We have the very best of people in the Australian Defence Force -  - We have people who have worked hard to maintain the very highest levels of professional skills within our military. And I have no doubt that, as they are requested to undertake specific matters put to them by the government of the day, they will be in a position to respond.</DOC>

 - I also pass on my best wishes for the member for Lilley's health. Centrelink certainly has been very active over the last few weeks since the collapse of Ansett. There have been a number of seminars and facilities that we have put in place, particularly working with the workers and with the ACTU to ensure that payments can be made as fast as possible to many of the workers who have been retrenched and subsequently are out of employment. As at the end of last week we had about 2,700 inquiries to the Centrelink call network regarding individuals among the 16,000 Ansett employees who had come to us with an intention to claim. A lot of those intentions to claim were put in by the ACTU when it lodged a generic claim. It is important for the House to recognise that when an individual applies for a Centrelink payment, whether it is a Newstart payment or a change in adjustment to family allowance or to child-care benefit, it is assessed on an individual basis. There are liquid asset waiting periods and a means test that they also have to apply. Certainly, as far as the intent to claim is concerned, even though they have not had a separation certificate, if they can demonstrate - all those employees have so demonstrated - that they are without employment, they are eligible. If there are individual cases, I will be very happy to look at them if the member would pass them to me.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. Financial markets have now operated in the United States for a full week since the terrorist atrocity in New York on 11 September. The Dow Jones index continued to fall on Friday another 1.7 per cent and it is now some 14.3 per cent below its close on the day before the terrorist attacks. This is the worst week since 1933, since the Great Depression, when there was a 15.6 per cent drop over five days ending on 21 July. The Australian All Ordinaries index at the end of the week was down 9.4 per cent and it has fallen by about one per cent or so today. That is a fall of about 10 per cent since the terrorist atrocities - a little less than the Dow Jones but still a very significant fall. The FTSE in the United Kingdom is down 11.9 per cent since prior to the terrorist atrocities, the DAX in Germany is down 18.9 per cent, the French Bourse is down about 16.7 per cent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong is down about 13.8 per cent. The falls in world equity markets have wiped trillions of dollars off the value of stocks and off the savings of individuals and of their pension and superannuation funds. In particular, the falls in relation to insurance stocks and airline stocks have been very significant. The second-round effects could be quite significant as well. If the second-round effects were to work their way into consumer confidence and business confidence, one would expect that they would have far broader application in the world economies affected.Prior to the terrorist attacks in New York commencing on 11 September, the significant centres of world growth were already in negative or zero territory. In the United States there had been no growth in the second quarter of 2001, in Japan there had been negative growth and in most of Europe there had been no growth. One would have to imagine that the events since the terrorist attacks in New York have at least weakened the United States economy, with the capacity to drag that into a contraction in the third quarter. Obviously, a contraction in the United States and in the world economy is going to take growth from Australia, notwithstanding the fact that we were one of the strongest performing economies in the industrial world in the first and second quarters of 2001. This represents a very significant challenge to us. The developments from the terrorist attacks in an already weak world environment mean that we are facing some of the biggest challenges that we have seen to world and national economic growth.The government intends to pursue its strong fiscal policy, which has now seen debt reduced by about $60 billion of the $80 billion that Labor racked up in its last five budgets. We intend to maintain the strong budget position that has enabled us to get the Australian Commonwealth debt into one of the best positions in the world. We intend to continue with our targeting of structural reform in the Australian economy. Now more important than ever are the tax reforms that have made Australian exports more competitive in the world and the income tax cuts that are delivering money back into the pockets of Australian consumers. The government intends to proceed with its low interest rate policy, which has enabled home buyers to enjoy much more disposable income than would have been the case had interest rates remained at the 10½ per cent they were at when this government was elected. I stress again that the importance of good economic policy has been heightened by these events. Now, more than ever, we need strong economic management here in Australia and now, more than ever, we need to -  - The Leader of the Opposition interjects and complains about backflips. This was the Leader of the Opposition that was going to underwrite Ansett and then he was not going to underwrite Ansett, and today he is going to put $200 million into Ansett. The government was informed that it would require $170 million to keep Ansett going for 48 hours. He has pledged $200 million which, according to that analysis, would get Ansett going for the next two days. When he was minister for finance he was in the business of privatising airlines and now that he is Leader of the Opposition he is in the business of nationalising them again - Qantas into privatisation; Ansett into nationalisation. There is not a skerrick of economic responsibility in any of these positions. It is pure, straight opportunism from a dying leader clenching with his fingernails as the issues go down. The flip and the flop: the flip this way on Ansett, the flop the other way.  - Many more flops than flips, if I may say so, in relation to the Leader of the Opposition. And if the case had been known -  -  - Can I say that the Australian economy is poised in a much better position than it would have been had we continued with $8 billion deficits, as was the Leader of the Opposition.  - The interjections get more and more bizarre in the shadow half-world that the Leader of the Opposition now inhabits. When he was minister for finance, he presided over a $13 billion deficit and a $10 billion deficit. When this government drove the budget into surplus, he opposed it every step of the way. If he had had his way, we would not have repaid the $60 billion of the $80 billion that the Labor Party ran up in its last five budgets. He now sits in here in some shadow land and says it has been recreated. These are outcomes. These are actual recorded outcomes of what the budget position was. In relation to economic policy, Australia goes now into uncharted waters, but we go stronger because we have had a balanced budget; because we paid back $60 billion of Labor Party debt; because we have reformed our industrial relations system and our taxation system; and because we overcame the opportunistic opposition of this Leader of the Opposition. Now, more than ever, Australia requires strong economic management. Now, more than ever, it is important to have in place a set of managers who will keep that policy directed to better outcomes for Australians in these uncertain times that we live in.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Jagajaga for her question. Until I think 1993 or 1994, to my recollection there had been no Commonwealth involvement in relation to dental care and the former government said that it would introduce a program on a temporary basis. It did that, and we allowed that program to work its way through. - We didn't axe the program; we allowed it to run out, which was exactly the intention of the former government, because it was made perfectly clear when the program was introduced that it was normally a responsibility of the states. It is true that more resources could be put into this area, and I would say very simply to the member for Jagajaga and to others, particularly Labor members from the state of Queensland, that in 2003-04 Queensland will be the first state to be better off as a result of the new taxation arrangements. I would say to all of the states of Australia that one of the purposes of taxation reform was to redress the long-term fiscal imbalance. It was designed to give to the states of Australia the financial wherewithal to discharge their responsibilities. If the member for Jagajaga were a backbench member of a Labor government which had maintained the wholesale sales tax and had not introduced taxation reform, I could understand her directing a question like that to the frontbench of her government. But when it is directed to a government that has accepted its responsibilities to give the states of Australia more money to discharge their obligations, I would simply say to the member for Jagajaga: if she believes that more resources should be put in the way of dental care, she should take it up with Mr Bracks, Mr Carr, Mr Beattie, Mr Olsen, Dr Gallop and Mr Bacon - because all of the states, as a result of the financial changes involved in the introduction of the new taxation system, are going to be infinitely stronger in order to discharge their responsibilities. What the GST has done is to provide the greatest guarantee, in the 27 years that I have been in politics, for state governments to look after their responsibilities. I really do thank the member for Jagajaga for asking me this question, because it enables me to point out the inherently contradictory nature of the Leader of the Opposition's position. On the one hand, his mantra is `health and education' and yet on the other hand he is against the very device that will enable this country to put more money into health and education, and that is the GST. This is another side of the flip and the flop. On the one hand he says `spend more' but on the other hand he says, `Don't give yourself the tax system that will give you the resources to spend more.' Health and education are primarily responsibilities of state governments; therefore the federal government that gives to the state governments the financial capacity to spend more money on health and education is the federal government that really has the long-term health and education needs of this country at heart. The Leader of the Opposition may say he is interested in more money for health and education; in reality he is against it, because he is opposed to the very taxation system that would enable this nation to do precisely that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is worth recounting to the House the very extensive steps that the government has put in place -  as it has worked very long hours and continues to work long hours - to form comprehensive responses to the collapse of Ansett. They include: a commitment to assisting the return to home base of Ansett aircraft on the day that the airline ceased operations; financial assistance to the many thousands of travellers stranded by the cessation of Ansett services; assistance with fares and accommodation; the immediate establishment of a special employee entitlements scheme to meet entitlements for wages, annual and long service leave, pay in lieu of notice and redundancy pay to the community standard of eight weeks; the establishment of the rapid route recovery program for regional areas; a month's complete relaxation of cabotage restrictions to enable international carriers to operate on the domestic market to assist in meeting demand; financial support for the re-establishment of the operations of Skywest -  which has been widely welcomed and is making a big difference in Western Australia, the biggest state in the Commonwealth - and the provision, as the Prime Minister outlined, of third party war risk indemnity to enable Australian airlines, including Ansett and its subsidiaries, should they start to move again, to continue flying in the light of significantly reduced insurance coverage available on world insurance markets. These have constituted a very significant response.  As would be expected, major trunk routes are operating at or near 100 per cent capacity, as operators work to cover the shortfall. Qantas have advised that, over the weekend, they operated an extra 29 flights over and above normal scheduling and that they have upgraded aircraft size on a significant number of routes. In fact, they have now returned to their home bases, for nothing, something like 40,000 people who were stranded, and around 35,000 have been carried forward on discount tickets. I understand too that Qantas continue to work on strategies to enable them to bring aircraft back from international routes to boost capacity on the domestic trunk routes.  - Virgin Blue advise that they are operating at virtually full capacity and that they are looking to alternatives to increase capacity. They are no longer looking at wet leasing aircraft from the Ansett administrator. In relation to regional air services, we are continuing to do everything in our power, in consultation with the administrator, to put at least basic services back in place. In the first round of operation under the routes recovery program, around $600,000 helped to restore services on eight regional routes. As I mentioned, Skywest in Western Australia resumed operations last week with the assistance of the federal government. In New South Wales, Aeropelican has resumed its previous services between Sydney and the Central Coast and, last week, Hazelton announced that it was putting two aircraft back into service. I can now confirm that the government has agreed to lend Hazelton $3 million over the next six months to secure the operation of that airline and to bring back more regional services under its arrangements. We have asked that airline to give priority to restoring services on routes that do not currently have adequate capacity.I know that we also welcome the announcement that a consortium headed by IT company Internova has purchased the travel agency Traveland from the Ansett administrator. That is good news; it provides employment security for 750 people employed by the former Ansett subsidiary. One would have thought, of course, that even the ACTU would have recognised that that was valuable. But I was surprised to note that Sharan Burrow, when she mentioned it, seemed almost disappointed. She said:Any of the bits, like Traveland, that may well be sold will only be sold if it allows it to remain a viable business and there is no other option.Which seems an extraordinary position to adopt. - It has to be said that one member of the union movement deserves to be commended for not being fooled by the ACTU leadership in this. The secretary of the South Australian Transport Workers Union, Alex Gallacher, at an ACTU rally in Adelaide on Friday, had this to say about the government's underwriting of entitlements and about the Prime Minister:Let's call a spade a spade. If it underpins, you know, our position and improves it then, fair enough, he's done the right thing.So I do not know that Mr Gallacher has improved his chances of advancement in the trade union movement, but he has done the right thing: he has come clean. He has done what they would not do here last week when there were people who wanted to explain what the government was doing for workers: he actually not only acknowledged that we were taking real steps to put in place arrangements for workers' entitlements but also wanted people to know about it. We commend him for it. That stands.I was asked about alternative approaches. Yes, we heard at half past one today that the Leader of the Opposition has done another flip-flop and has a new approach. He said that $150 million to $200 million would get Ansett flying again, which is very clever of him if that is his view. But it is conditional. It is said that this would work if Ansett were `freed of its existing debt'. What the Leader of the Opposition must immediately do if he is not to be simply charged with promoting the false, misleading hope of the ACTU is explain what is apparently obvious to him but to no-one else: firstly, how much this outfit does actually owe; we know it is around $2 billion but we do not know exactly. Secondly, and most importantly, he must indicate what his magic formula is for discharging that debt. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. I am very pleased that this government is standing shoulder to shoulder with Australian workers in these uncertain times and in their hour of need. It is the government's view that companies should pay workers 100 per cent of their entitlements. Companies should pay workers every last dollar of what they are owed. If they do not, this government will guarantee 100 per cent of unpaid wages; 100 per cent of annual leave; 100 per cent of long service leave; 100 per cent of pay in lieu of notice; and 100 per cent of redundancy pay, up to the community standard of eight weeks. The general entitlements scheme mirrors the protection offered to Ansett workers, except that payment rates will be set at a salary level of $75,000 a year.I have been asked about alternative policies. Let us consider what the Leader of the Opposition has done over the years to protect airline workers. The first ministerial job that the Leader of the Opposition had was actually Minister for Aviation. This is what he told his biographer about his time as Minister for Aviation. He said:I was a young Minister. I really didn't know fully what I was doing.That was the Leader of the Opposition on himself: `I really didn't know fully what I was doing.' The question is: has anything changed? Listen to the Leader of the Opposition talking last week at a doorstop. He said:Look, can you imagine Bob Hawke or Paul Keating walking away from this? Can you imagine a Labor Government just washing its hands of this sort of affair?What a convenient case of political amnesia. What about Compass, which went belly up without any help from the then Labor government? The workers lost their entitlements twice, without any help from the then Labor government. When you actually look into the history of the Leader of the Opposition, it just gets better and better. - In February 1992, the then government proposed in cabinet a total deregulation of airlines - this is from Neal Blewett and his cabinet diaries. They proposed a total deregulation. This is Blewett on Beazley:Beazley was typical, politically superb.That is what he said about the Leader of the Opposition and what he thinks about total deregulation of airlines. But Blewett went on to say about Beazley:But Beazley was also sure it would kill off smaller Australian companies and it might also finish off one of the major domestics. So the Leader of the Opposition knew back in 1992 and he was enthusiastic about the prospect of one of the major Australian domestic airlines dying because of the policies of the then Labor government. - Mr Speaker, ever since the Ansett crisis broke, the Leader of the Opposition has been running around constantly saying that the government should bail out airlines. Then he had the hide, not once but twice, to come into this parliament last week and explicitly deny his statements that the government should bail out airlines. If, after what he said in this parliament, he again has the gall to stand up and deny his view that governments should bail out airlines, a cock will crow. A cock will crow if he has the gall to stand up again. So where does this leave the Leader of the Opposition? In the words of Alan Ramsey:... a has-been politician and one of the worst, most infuriating leaders Labor has had to tolerate since Doc Evatt in the 1950s.That is what Alan Ramsey said about the Leader of the Opposition. He also said:He truly does not have a leadership bone in his body. - </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. In areas like health, there are important responsibilities for both the federal government and state governments. The federal government has very important responsibilities. One of the responsibilities we have is to make sure that, in health in Australia, there is a proper balance between public and private provision. That is why, when we inherited a private health system that was literally bleeding to death in 1996 and which reached the abysmal low of about 31 per cent of Australians covered by private health insurance, we set about changing it. We now have a situation where 45 per cent of Australians are covered by private health insurance. Despite the fact that, in the dead of night and under the cover of Cathy Freeman's victory in the 400 metres, a year ago tomorrow -  - the opposition put out a press release at about 7.32 that evening - just as Cathy Freeman went across the finishing line - so that nobody would see it, everybody knows that the only real believers in private health insurance in this parliament are the Liberal and National parties. It was the Liberal and National parties who revived private health insurance.   - The only reason the Labor Party has tentatively put up its hand in a faltering way and said, `Yes, yes, we'll sort of keep it if we can,' is that it knows the Australian people support the initiative of the government. That resuscitation of private health insurance has come at a cost of $2.5 billion a year to the federal budget. That is a priority which would never have been allocated by a Labor government. As well as putting $2.5 billion into private health insurance, we have also massively increased our direct funding to the states for public hospitals.  - Over the five years of the current Australian health care agreement, the amount of money going to state governments for their hospitals will rise by 28 per cent, which is far in excess of the rate of inflation over that period of time. When you take both of those things together, you find that the federal government has well and truly discharged its responsibilities, and those responsibilities are to provide more money for private health insurance, incentives to keep people in private health insurance and incentives to state governments to spend more money on state hospitals. But what have we seen state governments do in the same period? In the same period, while we have been increasing the money, state governments have been taking money out of public hospitals. In earlier discussions that we have had on this issue - and I am only too happy to return to them if the Leader of the Opposition elects to do so - we have demonstrated that the state governments of Australia have in fact, over the last few years, significantly failed to match the increase in money made available by the federal government.My answer to the generic issue raised by the Leader of the Opposition is, yes, the federal government does have important responsibilities. What we have done for private health insurance and public hospitals - the doubling of money on health and medical research, the very significant additional provision made in Backing Australia's Ability for scientific investigation, which is so important to health outcomes, and the investment in a centre of excellence in biotechnology - are all additional examples of the commitment of this government to very good health outcomes for Australians.It does not end at providing resources for private health insurance and government hospitals. It also goes to your attitude to things like immunisation rates. A few years ago when my colleague the Minister for Health and Aged Care found that this country had Third World immunisation rates, he actually set about doing something about it. Over the period of a few years, we have lifted those rates to levels not only of which Australia can be proud but also to which all Australians are entitled to aspire. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we have a very proud record of supporting both public and private provision of health in this country. Finally, I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, having done what we are meant to do at a Commonwealth level, we have done one thing more: we have given to the states the wherewithal for them to spend more money on hospitals and schools in the years ahead. - I heard the member for Melbourne interjecting, and one of the words he used was `demographics'. The demographic that faces Australia is an ageing population.  - If you have an ageing population, the last thing you want as a source of indirect tax revenue is a wholesale sales tax.  - A wholesale sales tax is a narrowing, diminishing, dying, wasting source of indirect taxation revenue, whereas a goods and services tax is a growing, expanding, diversifying, widening source of revenue for the provision of services. On all those scores, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: ask me as many questions as you like, because this government is very proud of its record in these areas of providing support for both public and private provision of health in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I can inform the House that earlier today the government announced that it had decided to defer the sale of Sydney airport until early in 2002. That decision followed the advice that came from the government's advisers that the government's sale objectives could not be satisfactorily met in the current time frame in light of the tragic events in the United States and the subsequent level of disruption to the global financial markets, to the airlines and to the aviation industry. Honourable members would know that the government decided to extend the deadline for the lodgment of binding bids from Monday of last week until Wednesday of this week, again in order to monitor the financial markets in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States. It has become clear that the responsible decision in the interests of all parties, particularly the Australian taxpayers, who have a right to an optimal return on this premier asset when the sale takes place, was to defer the sale of Sydney airport until early next year when the position is likely to be clearer. The government's advisers will continue to monitor the position closely and will remain in contact with the consortia that were preparing to lodge the binding bids. This indicates again that the government has a very clear objective and a clear policy position when it comes to the sale of Sydney airport.I have heard a lot of speculation on what might have happened from the proceeds of that sale - from a war chest for the election through to a slush fund. Like all asset sales that have occurred under the responsibility of this government, all the proceeds have gone to retire Labor's debt. That $96 billion of net debt has been reduced by some $60 billion, and the bulk of that has occurred from the sale of assets. What is Labor's position with regard to the sale of Sydney airport? It depends on what day or what week it is. I noted with interest that the former supporter of Bourke's department store and Solo petroleum, the member for Batman, on 7 September said - and I fully understand what he was saying - `It is not the responsibility of government to start putting on the table a taxpayer funded bailout of Ansett.' That is what the member for Batman said on 7 September.A week later, we had three different positions from the Leader of the Opposition. He said, firstly, that the sale of Sydney airport should be suspended. The government has done that now on the basis of some sensible advice. At the same time, he said that the government should use the proceeds of the sale of Sydney airport to satisfy the entitlements of Ansett employees. So he said we had to suspend it but use the proceeds to bail out the workers and their entitlements. Around the same time, he put forward the third position that we should fund a cash injection to keep Ansett flying.There is one bailout that every member on this side of the House would support the Labor Party on; there is one bailout that is able to be done at any time which will get unanimous support from members on this side of the House. Yesterday was the eighth anniversary of a legal document. That legal document required the taxpayers of Australia to make a payment of $4,883,733.50 per annum. The anniversary yesterday put that amount up by some $403,244. So the taxpayers of Australia are today paying over $400,000 on an annual basis. Who is the beneficiary of this taxpayer payment? The beneficiary is the Australian Labor Party.  - Everyone on this side of the House is more than happy to see the tenant, the Auditor-General, have a bailout organised by the Leader of the Opposition whereby a sensible rental is paid by the taxpayers of Australia to the Labor Party. We have deferred the sale of Sydney airport. That sale will proceed in an orderly fashion at the appropriate time, and the proceeds of that sale will retire a further amount of Labor debt when the sale occurs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Firstly, it is very hard to comment on a document that I am not certain about. But, if it came from the government, all I can say is that it must substantially increase your sum knowledge about health care, because we have failed to see anything from the Labor Party whatsoever and they have had 5½ years in which to do something. Secondly, I would be very happy to put the government's record on health care against anything any government has done previously in a similar period of time: the work in rural health, the work in public health - particularly with smoking, diabetes, mental health and immunisation -  the work with the last health care agreement, the work in primary health care and the fact that the level of bulk-billing is higher today than in the last full year of the Labor Party government. It is a very proud record in health care.On the issue of nursing specifically, if there is a problem it was 13 years of neglect under the Labor Party - a complete absence of ideas and a complete abdication of any responsibility whatsoever. I am very happy to have -  - the fact known that we are always looking for ideas. I am delighted that the opposition has finally got some of them, even if they are the government's.</DOC>

 - I can inform the House that over the weekend the Japanese government confirmed a case of BSE in a dairy cow in Japan. This announcement follows the testing of tissues in a specialist BSE reference laboratory in the UK. This is obviously a very serious development. It is the first case of BSE in native born cattle outside of Europe and it obviously has implications not only for the Japanese but indeed for cattle producers around world. Australia has acted promptly in response to this news. ANZFA has asked the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to suspend all cattle and beef product imports from Japan. As from today, these imports will be banned. Of course, we import only a very small quantity of Japanese beef - fewer than two tonnes. To put that into perspective, we export 336,000 tonnes of beef to Japan. So, while it is a relatively small amount, it is important that Australia take these precautions to maintain our disease-free status in relation to this disease. Retailers have been asked to withdraw from their shelves any Japanese beef products, and consumers have also been asked to remove from their pantries any Japanese beef products they might happen to have. The risks are exceptionally small, but they are risks that we recommend no-one should take. Australia will not accept any beef imports or any cattle imports from Japan while this issue remains unresolved and until we are satisfied that Japan is free of this quite appalling disease.Australia is one of only 16 countries in the world that enjoy the highest European status in relation to BSE rating. Our quarantine measures will help to ensure that this disease stays out of Australia. We have a ruminant animal feeding ban. We were one of the first countries in the world to implement such a ban, and that was strengthened recently at a meeting of agriculture ministers. Unfortunately, some states are not doing as much as they should be to enforce that ban, but there is no doubt that the regulations are in place, and it is absolutely essential for the quality of the Australian food supply system that those regulations are appropriately endorsed.Australian consumers can remain confident that our food supply chain is safe; that our meat is free of BSE and that we can eat Australian produced meat - both in this country and in Japan - in the confidence that it is healthy and that our exports to that country can indeed be underpinned through the knowledge of the clean green status that we work so hard to maintain. It is absolutely essential in that context that our $600 million expenditure on quarantine measures be maintained and not be whittled away to fund some kind of McHale's navy coastguard, which would do nothing whatever to protect us from the ingress of diseases of this nature.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for what is an important question. As I speak, we have not received any request from the United States. When a request is received - and I use the word `when' advisedly - we will naturally consider it. It will be considered in a positive light against the background of the statements I have previously made about the willingness of this country to assist the United States, because this challenge is a challenge to free peoples everywhere and it is not a challenge that should be borne by the United States alone. That is the view of this parliament, as enunciated in the resolution that was carried last Monday.The Leader of the Opposition will be aware from the time that he was in government that in circumstances such as this governments give consideration to a range of possibilities, so far as potential requests are concerned. That has obviously been what this government has done. We have had a number of discussions with the Chief of the Defence Force and our other service chiefs, and we are satisfied that this country will have a capacity, if requested, to make a positive and important contribution. But I repeat: no request has been received. I can indicate to the Leader of the Opposition that, consonant with my desire to see our cooperation with the Americans remain on a totally bipartisan basis, it will be my intention, when I receive a request and after it has been considered by the National Security Committee of cabinet, to ensure that the Leader of the Opposition is briefed on the intentions of the government. It is important that we remember that, if Australian forces are to go abroad, they will go abroad in the name of Australia; they will not go abroad in the name of any particular government. They will go abroad in the name of our entire country and I am sure they will have the goodwill and the prayers of the entire country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the House now knows, the last five budgets before this government was elected accumulated $80 billion of deficits and additional debt. In 1995-96, the deficit was $10 billion, in 1994-95 it was $13 billion, in 1993-94 it was $17 billion, in 1992-93 it was $17 billion, and in 1991-92 it was $11 billion. After its election, this government determined to put the budget back into surplus, which it did over a two-year period. The final budget outcome for the last financial year, which will show four consecutive surpluses, will be released, I hope, this week. We have now been able to pay back $60 billion of the Labor Party's $80 billion run up during their last five years.I am asked whether I am aware of any alternative budget plans. I am aware of a number of contradictory statements but of no plans coming from the opposition. It is very hard to get a handle on where the opposition now stand in relation to economic management. One day they stand for bigger surpluses; the next day they stand for more spending. One day they stand for roll backwards; the next day they do not stand for roll backwards. Private health insurance was described as a complete and monumental failure, but they intend to keep it. Work for the Dole was described as a shoddy piece of public policy, but they intend to keep it. Non-government schools funding was described as wrong headed. The GST was described as inherently unfair, but they intend to keep it. The border protection legislation was bipartisan for four hours, then it was opposed for one week and now it is supported. On the air ticket levy, the opposition said, `We think it's a stupid idea, but we support it.' Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition decided he would call a press conference to accuse the government of fiscal management which was irresponsible. `They have been quite extraordinary in the way they have allowed the budget to deteriorate,' he said. This is the finance minister who had two budgets - one was $10 billion in deficit and the other was $13 billion in deficit. `They have been quite extraordinary in the way they have allowed the budget to deteriorate,' he said, but he thought he would begin the press conference by calling for $200 million of additional spending. So he calls for $200 million of additional spending and finishes up by accusing the government of being financially irresponsible!One of the phrases that we have not heard used in the parliament for quite some time is `roll backwards'. The roll backwards policy seems to be dying a very slow and painful death. On the one hand, the GST is the worst thing that could possibly happen and has to be rolled backwards as far as possible, and, on the other hand, he has to spend more money. This is what he told the caucus today: ... Mr Beazley noted that the GST had weakened the economy considerably and this was being seen in a number of closures. What is emerging is the particular collapse around the country of significant companies like Ansett, One.Tel (and) Coles Myer. - Your spokesman is quoted on AAP as saying -  - I suppose this is the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital all over again, is it? The spokesman got it wrong again? The spokesman is quoted as saying:What is emerging is the particular collapse around the country of significant companies like Ansett, One.Tel (and) Coles Myer.Coles Myer has not collapsed. Coles Myer is not in danger of collapse, and it is utterly irresponsible, for political advantage or otherwise, for anybody to suggest otherwise. One of the most irresponsible things you could possibly do at a time like this is to stand up and suggest that Coles Myer is in danger of collapse. It is absolutely irresponsible for a spokesman to be doing that at meetings of journalists. It is something that should be withdrawn and apologised for immediately, because there are thousands of employees of Coles Myer who need the public to have confidence in relation to them.I thought it was only going to be a matter of time before the GST got blamed for Ansett and One.Tel. The GST is now responsible for One.Tel and Ansett. Apparently it has nothing to do with the directors of Air New Zealand; they have just been cleared. It has nothing to do with the management; they have just been cleared. It has nothing to do with Air New Zealand itself; they have just been cleared. It is complete political opportunism which now knows no bounds and draws no distinction in relation to Coles Myer. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I am aware of a news release that came out today from Coles Myer. I assume that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has turned to the second page of the news release. In the event that he has not, can I just take the House through the relevant paragraph - and no doubt the deputy's question is based on this statement. It says: As a result the organisational structure of GM&amp;A will operate with approximately 1000 fewer positions in its head office and support areas. - Yes, I am aware of that. It goes on to say:Importantly, our confidence in the future remains high with the expectation that Coles Myer new store openings in Victoria will create approximately the same amount of jobs in stores over the next year. -  - For the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to selectively refer to this matter in that blatant fashion goes beyond even his performance on other occasions in this House. Can I say that I will regret, as any member of this House will regret, any redundancy in any position in Australia, no matter what the circumstances, even though there will be compensating jobs created in other parts of the company in this case. I would remind those who sit opposite who seek to seize on this and try to make some cheap political capital out of it that the job creation record of this government since it came to office has been quite outstanding. The truth is that, based on the last set of figures that are available, we have generated something in the order of 892,000 additional jobs since we came to office. Only on the weekend, I read a briefing paper from my department that indicated that the level of full-time unemployment in Australia at the present time is, I think, at a 10-year low. - I am sorry, long-term unemployment. Long-term unemployment is at a 10-year low. So not only do we have record levels of job creation - almost 900,000 jobs in a year -  - Nine hundred thousand jobs since this government came to office. We have long-term unemployment at a 10-year low. We have, as the Treasurer pointed out, an economic record which has seen the repayment at the end of this financial year of close to $60 billion of the $96 billion of government debt that we inherited in March 1996.So, yes, I have seen the announcement about the redundancies in Coles Myer. Yes, I do regret that. I have also seen the prediction by Coles Myer that, as a result of new store openings, they expect an equivalent number of jobs to be created in stores over the next year. That is the statement that has been made. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to come to this debate as a serious contributor, as distinct from just a cheap political point scorer, he will acknowledge the full context in which that statement was made.I join the Treasurer in condemning the Leader of the Opposition for talking down Coles Myer. The Leader of the Opposition, not content with talking down the Australian economy, has now trained his sights on individual Australian companies. He shakes his head. They must have another young mistake maker doing their party room briefings. They apparently did not learn from the Charles Gairdner experience. Either the Leader of the Opposition is talking Coles Myer down or they have another young mistake maker on trainer wheels giving the caucus briefing. It is all here in quotation marks in this news report today. It said:A caucus spokesman said Mr Beazley noted that the GST had weakened the economy ... and this was being seen in a number of closures. - Closures - not job losses, not redundancies, but closures. Mr Beazley was then quoted as saying: What is emerging is the particular collapse around the country -  Collapse and closure - not redundancy, but collapse and closure. That is basically what he is saying. I think it is irresponsible of the Leader of the Opposition, and I think it is irresponsible of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to deliberately and selectively quote from a press statement. - I have finished.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. While the Leader of the Opposition has been floating all sorts of proposals which vary from one side of the day to the other as to what they might mean, and while the alternative transport minister of the nation has had absolutely nothing of any substance to say about the current serious situation in aviation, we have been working extremely hard with all parties to seek to restore services wherever we can. Last week we assisted Skywest in Western Australia with a $3½ million loan under our rapid recovery program for regional areas. -  - They laugh, but in Western Australia, as I think a lot of members have acknowledged, that program has got vital services back. It demonstrates again that the opposition is not interested in outcomes; it is interested in politics on this issue. Earlier today the government provided a similar loan to Kendell Airlines that will enable them to resume flights in South Australia. As from Thursday, Kendell will resume services from Adelaide to Port Lincoln, Olympic Dam, Whyalla, Broken Hill, Coober Pedy, Mount Gambier, Ceduna and Kingscote. Services from Melbourne to Burnie, Devonport and King Island - King Island having been a place very much in need of services because it is so heavily dependent upon them - will resume shortly as well. That is extremely welcome news. It reflects our absolute commitment to grappling with this problem on an hour by hour basis and to finding resolutions to the issues. This stands in contrast to the idea floated by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday: the rescue plan based on the idea that $2 billion of debt could simply be mystically floated away. As part of that, it is worth noting that journalists asked the Leader of the Opposition whether he was envisaging a new business entity. His answer was:That is correct, but it would have to be worked through with the administrator. All those other issues of debt - Two billion of them! He continued:and the rest of it would have to be worked through in their discussions and consultation.This is leadership from the opposition! So journalists then asked the Leader of the Opposition the obvious follow-up question: Doesn't a new entity mean that the Minister for Transport is right when he says that, unfortunately, the old Ansett is dead?Answer from the Leader of the Opposition:It would be a new Ansett in a sense, but it would also be the body which would employ the people who are associated with Ansett and resolve the administrator's problem.There is only one translation you can put on that: he is saying I am right. That is what he is saying. So, while he is out there with the union movement offering a false hope, he is in reality conceding that I am absolutely right. The Leader of the Opposition was then asked whether the new entity would need to be restructured to address issues such as the generosity of workers' packages. The journalist, interestingly, even asked, `What are we actually talking about?' which I think was a very good question, and the Leader of the Opposition answered:Obviously, all these issues would have to be worked through with the work force, wouldn't they - by the people who were the new owners of the operation.This is doubletalk posing as statesmanship. It is directionless and meaningless.There is another matter that I want to draw to the House's attention. There are a lot of hours, including by members of my department, going into working through every issue as it arises, including a lot of consultation with the administrator. As the administrator comes to us with proposals for re-establishing services, we are putting a lot of work into each part of those, and I think that is very important. I now hear that the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee is planning to hold tonight a hearing into the Ansett collapse. That, obviously, will be another exercise in political point scoring by the Labor Party. - They call it `accountability', but can I just make this point, because it is obvious they have not thought through the importance of how this might impact on what they say is their objective of trying to get Ansett employees back into jobs, of trying to refloat as much of the operation as might be possible: it has just been drawn to my attention that the administrator, having learned about that, has expressed his very deep concern indeed that this little exercise may severely prejudice our negotiations with key stakeholders and thereby lessen the likelihood of the Ansett group business continuing in existence. So I urge the ALP and that committee to look long and hard at the administrator's real concerns that, far from helping to resolve the situation - far from helping Ansett employees - this exercise may very well have exactly the opposite effect, and therefore they ought to reconsider their position on the matter.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Dickson, I have not sighted that communication. I am not saying that it has not been sent, but I have not sighted that communication. I have, however, sighted an interview between Michael Donovan, the state secretary of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, and John Fayne on Melbourne radio this morning. I think he was being pretty objective. He is the secretary of that union and I guess he votes Labor, but I am not absolutely certain. Not all shoppies vote Labor, but I think one or two of them do, and one or two vote elsewhere as well, I know. -  - Mr Donovan actually said, `No, it is not totally the GST.' He then went on to say, `Daimaru's problem has been that it has not been making money in Australia, so obviously the company has made a decision that it is not going to make money so it is going to close.' I think what the secretary of the union was doing was acknowledging that the level of competition in the retail industry was such that some companies had done better than others. Clearly, what has happened in the Australian retail industry over the last couple of years is that Woolworths has outcompeted all of the other major operators. One of the reasons why Coles Myer is not doing as well as it used to do is that Woolworths has done extraordinarily well. If the thesis being advanced by the member for Dickson and by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were correct, presumably the same thing would be happening to Woolworths and to all retailers as is happening to Coles Myer. The reality is that, if you look at the retail sales figures over the last year, they have been very strong, despite all the predictions of doom and gloom from the opposition. - Retail sales have been one of the elements of the Australian economy that has held up extremely well. I happen to have in front of me a news release from Woolworths, which says, `Woolworths announces a double-digit growth year. Sales profits and dividends rise double-digit. Sales up 10.1 per cent, earnings before interest up 13.7 per cent, average return on funds employed up 35 per cent, normal operating profit after tax up 17 per cent, earnings per share up 24.1 per cent, dividend per share up 17.4 per cent.' That is the performance, and that happened under the GST.Incidentally, the Labor Party, if they win the election, are going to hang on to the GST for dear life. If the Labor Party win the election, you can bet your bottom dollar that they will not be abolishing the GST. They will be clutching the GST to their collective bosom with great enthusiasm and great energy. Let me simply say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and also to the member for Dickson that, if the GST were the ogre you argue it is, two things would occur: its impact on retail sales would be across all companies and, secondly, the Australian Labor Party would embrace a policy, if they win the election, of getting rid of it. The reality is that in the retail industry Coles Myer has not fared well in the face of very strong competition from Woolworths. For the reasons outlined by the shoppies, Daimaru has had great difficulty in making money in the whole time that it has been operating in Australia, and it has been operating in Australia now for a number of years.I also remind the House that Coles Myer is not closing down. Coles Myer is not in difficulty. Coles Myer is proposing to retrench 1,000 people in its head office, and it believes that it is going to replace that number of people through new store openings in other parts of Victoria. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who represents a seat in Melbourne, that, instead of trying to talk down the employment prospect of Victorians, instead of trying to spread doom and gloom, instead of trying to talk down a great Australian company that has had a great tradition of serving the people of Melbourne, he should be out there encouraging Coles Myer, he should be out there looking in a very positive way and he should abandon his doom and gloom talk. It failed in relation to the Australian economy, and it will fail in relation to Coles Myer. </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for McPherson for her question. Indeed, as neighbours we share a concern for those Ansett employees who worked at Coolangatta airport. The reason she has asked this question is that, true to form, the opposition unfortunately has been spreading a lot of misinformation and, quite frankly, has been using scare tactics on those 16,000 employees. I would like to address this issue later on in my answer. What they need at the moment is support, and that is exactly what this government is offering them.Centrelink does have an important role to play, particularly in helping those Ansett workers. I would just like to commend and also to thank the staff of Centrelink for their tremendous effort in responding to this urgent situation over the last three weeks. Certainly the Centrelink call network has been answering many questions. We have also been holding over 80 seminars now, right across the country, to inform people of the options that are open and particularly, of course, provide information about the claim for income support. As at 20 September, around 1,300 Ansett employees have already attended these sessions. Since Friday, 14 September, Centrelink has been accepting intentions to claim. This means that former employees will be paid from the earliest date possible.We have been working with the ACTU and, of course, with the administrator to make this process as simple and as easy as possible for affected workers. Ansett employees applying for payments will not have to lodge a separation certificate to be eligible, by special arrangements with Centrelink. Obviously this saves considerable time, and what we are trying to do is to speed up the payments. To date, we have received over 3,500 claims. Another important point is that employees laid off because of the Ansett collapse who are not direct Ansett employees will be able to supply a separation certificate, as is the normal requirement.I have to say that this government has been bending over backwards to ensure that we assist the Ansett employees. Of course, what we have already done is the major announcement last week by the Prime Minister and by the relevant minister to ensure that 100 per cent of statutory entitlements are met as a backstop by this government. You never did it. You never did it when Compass went under. You never did it with Adsteam, Bond, Bell -  - You never did it when Compass failed - Compass 1 or 2. You never did with Adsteam or Bell or Bond or Budget or Qintex or Hooker or any of the TV stations that went down in the halcyon days of the Labor Party during the eighties, and you certainly are not providing that support now. What we have been trying to do is provide a fair and equitable -  - But, of course, what the Labor Party are doing -   - They are trying to use the Ansett employees as pawns in a political game to score their own points, which I think is quite regrettable, particularly in the situation where we see press releases being put out by the member for Lilley and also by the member for Dickson, knowing full well what the entitlements are that Centrelink can provide, but claiming that we are turning people away from Centrelink's office. That is absolutely incorrect. What this has shown is that this government and the Prime Minister 100 per cent - and John Anderson - have displayed impeccable leadership when it comes to trying to resolve this crisis that you never have; it is unlike the flip-flop attitude of the Australian Labor Party. The question you got to ask yourself is: can they govern themselves? Well, even in the federal seat of Richmond, the most important person, the head of the FEC of the Richmond Labor Party, has stood down and is running as an independent Labor Party person because she is fed up with the factional brawling and the incapacity of the Leader of the Opposition to govern. If you cannot govern your party -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can confirm to the House that it is my understanding that negotiations between Qantas and the administrator over attempts to build extra capacity based on the use of Ansett planes have come to an end. Beyond that, what I would want to say is this: we seek at all times - I want to make this plain - to ensure the best possible outcome from an unfortunate situation. The suggestion that we have not worked at every available angle, every possible opportunity, to seek to, firstly, keep it flying but, secondly, over and beyond that since then, to work with every possible alternative proposal that is put up to ensure that jobs are preserved, that opportunities are delivered upon, is just nonsense. We have.I just make the point that the administrator, as he has said publicly, cannot see a way clear to do what the Leader of the Opposition seems to believe is possible - in one moment; he changes his mind the next moment - and refloat Ansett in the form that it was in. But, quite plainly, he wants to maximise the use of the assets and of the potential in the marketplace that is there for the benefit of all, including Ansett employees. Any suggestion that we are anything other than fully committed to those outcomes is just ridiculous. I think, on reflection, it is relevant for me to table the letter from Andersen's in which, amongst other things, they confirm their own commitment to and their own work program towards, in the first instance, stabilising the Ansett business and, more recently, the analysis of a phased partial recommencement of operations.We are seeking to facilitate that happening in every way, while the Leader of the Opposition does nothing but play cheap politics with this. He failed to show any leadership at all when we challenged him last week on the issue of the rallies around the country. Do you think we might now ask him to show a modicum of leadership and respond to the administrator, who plainly has a concern that, far from helping Ansett and its employees, the inquiry proposed in the Senate will prejudice their chances of a decent outcome? Will he respond to that? Will he show some leadership for the first time? I table the letter. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question and acknowledge her interest in these matters over a long period. First, I very much regret having heard some comments and observations, with support, we are led to believe, from the opposition, about the way in which policy is conducted in Australia by this government. In relation to the approach that we take to these matters, I have heard some comments that have suggested that we are reintroducing the White Australia Policy and that it constitutes apartheid. When I hear comments of that sort, I am generous in saying that I think that they are misguided, but pejorative comments of that sort do those who offer them no credit and they indicate a very significant lack of understanding about the way in which Australia, over a long period of time, has assisted and aided refugees.Refugees who have come to Australia under resettlement programs that have been conducted over many years have come primarily from countries in Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans and Asia. They do not come from Europe, in the main, and they certainly do not come from North America. If you were going to constitute policies of that sort and describe them as the reintroduction of a White Australia Policy, nothing could be more misconceived. We have developed a range of measures to ensure that our refugee and humanitarian program continues to operate and to provide resettlement opportunities for people who are in desperate need of resettlement. I make the point very strongly that with 23½ million refugees in the world and with a little over 100,000 resettlement places available, 100,000 places into 23½ million do not go. There have to be some choices, and those choices are not made by identifying people who have the money to travel and are free enough to travel and to engage people smugglers. - The choices are made by seeking out those who cannot stay where they are, who are not in a position of safety and security, who cannot return home and who need to be assisted. - I tabled last week a paper which I hope honourable members have read, because it outlined very fully the range of measures that we have put into place to deal with these issues. I have been engaged over the last three or so years in trying to get a focus of the international community on what has been happening in Pakistan and Iran. After 20 or so years, a lot of countries were turning their backs on what had happened there, resources were being withdrawn, the UNHCR's budget was contracting, and there were inadequate resources to deal with the very significant problems and to get people back, if that was possible, into situations of safety and security. That approach is one that we have continued to address and have enhanced by the measures that we have announced: we would fund the UNHCR to bring governments together to discuss and find solutions to what has been happening in that part of the world; an extra $4 million to deal with the registration of people, for whom the UNHCR does not have the resources at the moment, in Pakistan; and an extra $10 million to focus on what has been happening in that part of the world, through NGOs and the UNHCR. That was an effective doubling of the support that Australia has been giving to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.We also have sought to deal with pull factors, and pull factors are involved in the legislation that is presently before the Senate. I do not wish to go into the package of measures in any detail, save to say that they are about strengthening the integrity of our border protection arrangements and ensuring that refugee determination procedures here in Australia are equitable; that is, equitable with those people who are languishing abroad -  let me make that very clear - not in terms of giving people who are not refugees migration outcomes but in terms of ensuring that people who are making claims in Australia are making claims on the same basis as they would if they were in Indonesia, Pakistan or Malaysia. That is not the situation that obtains at the moment. As I read some of the comments about what we are doing in another place, the focus on the issue of judicial review does not surprise me, but it is a focus by some who are more worried about their income stream than about humanitarian issues when they seek to maintain that sort of system in place, which is ripping out hundreds of millions of dollars here and in other places where people want to test the limits of refugee determination in places where it is comfortable enough to do so.  - I am aware that the measures that we have announced have had the support of the opposition, and I welcome that support. I welcome it on the basis that it is good policy. I would be very regretful if, as has been suggested in other places, the reason the opposition came to a view that these bills should be supported was because they wanted to get off the hook of what they might perceive to be a political problem. I would hope that it is because, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, it is good policy. But I very much regret it when I read some statements, one by the shadow minister which says that if Labor was elected it would implement its own plan if it won office, and I am concerned when I read Senator McKiernan in another place saying:I give notice now that I shall do whatever I possibly can to get this changed ... when Labor win office at the forthcoming election. Or when I hear Senator Schacht saying about the bills, `It will not work in a number of ways,' and then going on to say on Adelaide radio this morning, `When we get back into government, we will review any number of areas and make adjustments accordingly.' If this is good policy, support it because it is right and take the credit because it is right, but don't have this idea that you can come in here and say that it is good policy and then have some of your backbenchers and some of your frontbenchers walking away from the commitments.</DOC>

 - I will take a risk and accept that what the Leader of the Opposition has said I said at that particular time is accurate. I do remember a debate about a deed of arrangement. As I recall it, it was not in the context of an injection of resources into getting the company going again; it was not in that context at all. My recollection - I will check this, and I may be wrong, because I do not have the file with me - is that the deed of arrangement issue was raised by my critics at the time with the allegation that in some way, by entering into a deed of arrangement, some wider examination of the affairs of the company was prevented. I might add as a rider that wider examination of the affairs of that company was not avoided. In fact, an examination was carried out by ASIC, and that examination found -   - My memory is of that; that it was in the context of criticism that, by having a deed of arrangement, you avoided the more searching examination by a liquidator. The answer was that it was in the interests of the creditors of the company that there be a deed of arrangement, not to avoid any kind of searching examination. In fact -  - I remind the interjecting Leader of the Opposition that there was an investigation carried out, I think by ASIC, and that investigation gave a clean bill of health to the then chairman of the company. - Yes, I have.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I am aware of examples of union intimidation and thuggery; in particular a smash-and-grab raid mounted on two Victorian businesses and led by none other than the Victorian Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Craig Johnston. This is the bloke who reckons that the way to have a conversation with business is to smash down the front door with a crowbar. This is the bloke who controls more than 10 per cent of the votes of the Victorian state conference of the Australian Labor Party - whose union has given $680,000 to members opposite and whose political allies are now trying to nobble a police investigation into these offences. Let the Australian people know that the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite want to give more power to people like Craig Johnston.The latest development is that two senior Victorian union officials have lost their jobs because they refused to pay a compulsory levy to meet Craig Johnston's legal fees. This is but a foretaste of what would happen in Australia should the Leader of the Opposition ever become Prime Minister. It is Labor's policy to allow unions to impose a $500 a year levy on non-union members. This means that up to six million Australians would face a $500 a year union tax to create the greatest political slush fund of all time. - In Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald, the Leader of the Opposition said:If you take a real hard stance on a real hard issue politically, you are likely to get flayed.What would the Leader of the Opposition know about anything like that? Mr Flip Flop has never taken a hard stance on anything. - The Leader of the Opposition now has the chance to show whether his jawbone is connected to his backbone. - He needs to say exactly whether he supports Craig Johnston. -  - The Leader of the Opposition has a chance in this House to say exactly where he stands. Does he support Craig Johnston, or does he support the unionists who have lost their jobs? Does he support the union tax, or does he support freedom of association? -  - The Leader of the Opposition has an opportunity to demonstrate to the Australian people whether he will stand up for Australia or whether he will stand up only for the interests of the union movement. The Australian people want to know exactly where the Leader of the Opposition stands. They will be weighing carefully his behaviour over the next few weeks, because they have come to the conclusion that, if he is not allowed to govern his own party, he should never be allowed to govern the country.</DOC>

 - In thanking the Leader of the Opposition for his question, I take issue with the central claim - that is, that there has been a decline in the number of jobs. The truth is -  - The measurement of a part-time job, according to my understanding -  - The question was posited on a decline in full-time jobs. The difference between a part-time job and a full-time job under the current classification is that a part-time job is under 35 hours a week -  - Above one and under 35. - By definition, it would have to be above one. The reality is that you cannot look at just full-time jobs. Given the character of the Australian labour market and the far greater level of female participation in the labour market, in order to get the overall job structure you cannot look at just full-time jobs. The Leader of the Opposition conveniently does that to try to score a point. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that, if you are honest and objective about this issue, you would look at both full-time and part-time jobs, just as you look at short-term and long-term unemployment. The undeniable truth is that the unemployment rate in Australia is now below seven per cent. It was at 8½ per cent when we came to office. It had averaged 8.7 per cent in the time that the Labor Party were in government. We have generated almost 900,000 new jobs, based on the most recent employment data. In those circumstances, there is no credibility in the claim being made by the Leader of the Opposition that the GST has cost jobs in this country.There was a downturn in the December quarter of last year. The government responded very rapidly and very effectively to that in relation to the housing industry. The doubling of the home savings grants for new homes has led to a spectacular resurgence. We do not hear very much about this from the other side - it is rather uncomfortable -  but it has led to a spectacular resurgence in the housing industry and many jobs have been added in that sector.I have to say to the Leader of the Opposition that he has now had 5½ years to carve out an alternative vision for the future of this country. All he has done in that 5½ years, and particularly since the introduction of the GST, is to say his prayers every night in the vain hope that the economy would fall over as a result of the introduction of the GST. That has not happened, and he is now paying the price for putting all of his political eggs in the basket of total negativity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I am aware of threats to the payment of school funding entitlements. Those threats come from the Australian Labor Party, which is opposing the granting of money to the government which would enable payment of their legal entitlements to 54 schools, including Catholic parish schools, a Jewish day school, low fee Christian schools, Montessori and Steiner schools and the poorest non-government school in the country, the Nyikina Mangala community school in the Kimberley. All these schools have had their legal funding entitlements put at threat because of the opposition of the Labor Party to the payment of establishment grants to these schools.The Leader of the Opposition has a very inconsistent statement on the record in relation to the Labor Party's current position. On 6 August he made a personal explanation to this House. He said:... the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has said ... that I am threatening the funds to Catholic schools and to low income private schools. We are not; we support the grants that go to those schools.He says, `We support grants to those schools,' but they oppose the legislation that will fund those grants. On the one hand he supports the grants and on the other hand he opposes the funding of those grants. On the flip side he supports the grants and on the flop side he opposes the grants. Under pressure from the extremist union leaders, he is forced to compromise. So on the one hand he takes a publicly stated position and on the other hand does something entirely different. The Leader of the Opposition flip flops and the Nyikina Mangala community school - the poorest non-government school in the country - will miss out on their estimated October payment of $4,500. The Leader of the Opposition flip flops and the Jubilee Catholic Primary School will not receive their estimated October payment of $26,000. The budget of the Murray Bridge Christian College is thrown into disarray because they will not get their October payment unless the Leader of the Opposition stands up to the unions. The problem is that the Leader of the Opposition has never stood for anything. He will say anything for the moment to try to gain a bit of credit or make a point, but when there is a bit of pressure imposed that position is abandoned. The unions push him around. They push him around like a battleship in a bathtub: they push him to this end and they push him to that end, and there is a compromise all the way. It is no wonder he is beginning to take on a bit of water. The Leader of the Opposition is a battleship in a bathtub. That is all he is to these lobby groups behind him, pushing him from one end to the other. He stands for nothing and the Australian people are finding that out.The hypocrisy of the opposition's position on these establishment grants is extraordinary. The Leader of the Opposition says that he opposes funding to rich schools but, when you look at the reality, you see that he is opposing funding to some of the poorest schools in Australia and he is saying that these schools are getting their funding at the expense of government schools. Last week, Archbishop Pell, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, said that the Catholic families `would not appreciate any suggestion that they might be taking money from their State school neighbours'. Yet that is precisely the suggestion that the Leader of the Opposition is making. So we have a Leader of the Opposition who stands for nothing, who flip flops from one side to the other, and that is becoming very obvious to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I say in response to the member for Ryan that, as a result of developments in the Australian aviation industry, and particularly flowing from the grounding of Ansett, there has been an increase in some of the airline prices. I accept that; she is absolutely right in saying that. The member for Ryan asked me whether it automatically followed that getting Ansett operating again was the solution to the problem. I would have to say to the member for Ryan that that might superficially seem to be the answer, but the reality is that one of the many reasons that Ansett got into difficulties was that it could not handle some of the discounting of airline charges that went on. The reality is that some of the discounting that went on -  - The fact of the matter is that, in the long run, when you have a very strong price war, the strongest competitor is always the one that is able to withstand the discounting, and the strongest competitor was Qantas. I would say to the member for Ryan that we all like cheap air fares and that the way you have cheap air fares is to have as many competitors as possible, but you only have competitors if they can be sustained commercially. It is just unrealistic to imagine that you can build a competitive airline industry on the basis of government subsidies. You might imagine that, in the short run, some kind of government surveillance or involvement is beneficial. I have to say that I do not. I think that the experience of competition policy in this country has been that, where you have seen significant reductions in consumer prices and they have been sustained over a long period of time -  - No, actually I have in mind interest rates and telephone charges, which are two very spectacular examples of how competition has been beneficial. Ansett got into financial difficulties for a whole host of reasons: bad management, the behaviour of the board of Air New Zealand, some very uncompetitive industrial relations arrangements - and I notice that the member for Ryan nods her head. The reality is that, if some of the arrangements in the industrial relations area that were made in the old Ansett era had not been made, I do not believe that airline would have got into the difficulty that it did over the last few years. If there is to be any chance of a slimmed down Ansett reviving for a sustained period of time -   - The member for Batman says, `Rubbish'. If the member for Batman really cares about the long-term interests of Ansett workers, he will not pretend to them that they can return, without any amendment, to the old industrial relations structure, because that is completely unrealistic. People who hold out the hope of being able to do that have no regard at all to the interests of the Ansett workers. One of the reasons why Qantas survived and Ansett did not was that Qantas had a more realistic industrial relations system. That is one of the reasons why it survived. So I would say to the member for Ryan, who I know asked this question very sincerely: yes, there has been an increase in air fares; I accept that. That is self-evident. - The only way in the long term that you can return to a situation of more price competition in relation to airline tickets is to have commercially sustainable competitors, and you do not have commercially sustainable competitors by the government pumping $200 million into one of them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. One year ago today, I was at Homebush Bay with my family, cheering Cathy Freeman. But Cathy Freeman was not the only one running fast that day. The Leader of the Opposition was sprinting as well. He scurried up to Ballarat -  - and, under cover of the biggest sporting event in this country's history and of one of the biggest events in the world last year, he announced that the opposition was going to keep the government's 30 per cent rebate, thereby leaving the member for Jagajaga in the starting blocks. For two years, Labor had railed against the 30 per cent rebate. We had 32 media releases in 18 months, including such releases as `Thirty per cent rebate a dismal failure' in May 1999, `Health rebate attracts little new demand' in February 1999, `Costly rebate will hit most Australians' in December 1998, and `Health insurance bill $1.7 billion down the drain' in December 1998. Not only that, the member for Jagajaga described it in parliament as the worst example of public policy ever seen in this parliament; and the Leader of the Opposition, while not exactly enthusiastic, said - just three days before his backflip in Ballarat - `You know, I've never seen so many people sold a pup as have been sold this private health insurance scam.' So you can imagine how surprised I was 12 months ago when I saw the Leader of the Opposition do his doorstop and announce that he had changed his mind. I can also imagine the look on the face of the member for Jagajaga.Twelve months later, wherever the Leader of the Opposition goes, he talks about Labor's 80 policies. They are all up on the web for anybody to see. - I thought that, given this was the 12-month anniversary, I should look on the web and see if I could find anything about private health insurance among Labor's 80 policies. All I could find was a press release from November last year which said, `Wooldridge scaremongering on health insurance'. It is interesting that Labor should choose to quote me far more often than the opposition spokesperson on health in the only thing on their web site on private health insurance. The fact is that during the recent Aston by-election the Labor Party candidate in Aston refused to sign a pledge saying that he would work to not make any changes to the 30 per cent rebate.  The Leader of the Opposition has consistently failed to rule out removing the rebate from ancillaries, grandfathering the rebate, leaving it without high front-end deductibles, making ineligible those products with exclusions, or paying the rebate only at base rate premiums. He has wriggled; he has used weasel words consistently over the last 12 months. He has refused to rule these out, and he will be condemned for it at the election. </DOC>

 - I can see the Leader of the Opposition is getting excited. I understand why he is getting excited: for the first time in 5½ years, he has actually got a health policy in his hand. Unfortunately, it has come from the government, not from the opposition.  - In July 1999, the member for Jagajaga, addressing the Australian Nurses Federation, made commitments to have policies in these areas within nine months - that is, March 2000: `Develop a publicly funded coordinated care program to supplement Medicare for the elderly and chronically ill'. We have not seen that. `Overcome the major inequities in our health system with programs targeted at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health'. We have not seen it. `Improve access to health in rural and remote Australia'. That has never been mentioned. `Tackle the special needs of mental health'. Nothing whatsoever. `Focus on health promotion and early intervention'. Vanished. `Control the rising cost of medicine by ensuring technology is used effectively and appropriately.'  - The opposition had nothing to say on that whatsoever. She said, `These are all difficult issues' - they are very difficult for the opposition - `and they need to be addressed. Over the next nine months, we will be going through an intensive process to develop policies for the next election.' The only policies that we have seen are policies that have come out of a draft document, an internal working document from the Department of Health and Aged Care. I will give the Leader of the Opposition a bit of advice: you would not want to rely on the figures here. Because it is an internal working document it did not go to other departments. The figures are not correct. It was a think piece; it was a wish list. In essence, if you read it all, what you will see is a health care system that delivers the second longest healthy life expectancy of any country in the world after Japan. You will see a health care system that immunises its kids, rather having its kids die of measles, which was the legacy of Labor's public health policy. You will see a health care system that has delivered the lowest smoking rate in the Western world, having been stuck at 24 per cent after a decade of inactivity under Labor. You will see a vigorous and vibrant private health care system, a public hospital system with record increases in funding -   - You will see doctors getting back into rural Australia after 30 years of decline. Basically, Mr Speaker, you will see a very successful health care system - the envy of other countries in the world. Honestly, if the best the opposition can do is get excited about a draft wish list from my department, pity help them.</DOC>

 - I am aware that Mr Harvey has made some comments. I have not read them, but I will. I took the opportunity overnight of having a little research and work done in relation to the claim being run by the Leader of the Opposition and others that in some way the GST has done great damage to the retail industry, and particularly the claims made in relation to Daimaru and Coles Myer. I have a number of responses to those claims. I do not accept them. They are wrong, and I believe that the responses that I will put on the table today will go to that very issue.I will quote first Mr Tim Piper, speaking on behalf of the Retail Traders Association on the John Fane ABC program this morning. He said that there was an impact 14 months ago when it was introduced, but he then went on to say:I think it is a long bow now to stretch to say that we are still involved in that sort of dilemma. I think it is more the economic climate and people changing the way in which they are spending. People are spending more money now in lifestyle spending, hospitality as you mentioned earlier, communication. The amount of money that we spend on the Internet and mobile communications all affects the ability to spend in the traditional retail area.The strongest possible argument in refutation of what the Leader of the Opposition is putting forward is that, if the GST were responsible for weaker household spending, by fundamental definition it ought to show up in weaker consumption of services, because services were not previously subject to a GST. However, the national accounts show that, in the year since the GST was introduced, growth in consumer spending on services has been stronger than it was in the year before the GST was introduced. I do not hear that from the Leader of the Opposition or from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The other things you do not hear from the Leader of the Opposition when there is selective analysis of retail spending are that, since January 2001, total retail spending in value terms has grown by five per cent; food retailing has gone up by 4.2 per cent; department stores by 2.8 per cent; clothing and soft good retailing has gone down by 0.2 per cent, but it did go up by 21 per cent in July 2000; household good retailing is up by 9.2 per cent; recreational good retailing is up by 0.6 per cent; other retailing is up by 7.8 per cent; and hospitality and services are up by 6.6 per cent. These figures capture the whole spectrum of retail spending in the Australian community.I know that the Leader of the Opposition is desperately trying to grab hold of some news to try and present himself in some kind of positive light. He would be better employed spending his time proposing some positive solutions instead of trying to grab hold of every tiny morsel of negative news and trying to exploit it to the disadvantage of the Australian community. That is not the kind of tactic he ought to follow. I have just been handed a copy of what Mr Gerry Harvey really said. While the next question is being asked, I will take the opportunity to read it and, if I can give the House any more information, I will. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McEwen for her question. I can advise the House that the final budget outcome for the year ended 30 June 2001 showed an underlying cash surplus of $5.6 billion. This is the fourth cash surplus outcome under this government's first five years of government. The cash outcome of $5.6 billion surplus came out as stronger than was put down at budget time and stronger than was expected in May of this year. Principally, it was led by higher revenue from company tax, reflecting higher than expected company profitability and also fewer companies taking up the option to defer company tax payments. It was also helped by a reduction in expenses, principally a reduction in the numbers expected in May of this year of people claiming or receiving unemployment benefits.The final budget outcome tables the five budget outcomes under this government. In the five years prior to the election of this government the outcomes were as follows: deficit $10 billion, deficit $13 billion, deficit $17 billion, deficit $17 billion and deficit $11 billion. For the last two of those, with cumulative deficits of $23 billion, the finance minister responsible was none other than the now Leader of the Opposition. The government took that budget deficit of $10 billion, halved it in its first year to a deficit of $5 billion and has now produced four consecutive underlying surpluses. They are as follows: $1.1 billion surplus, $4.1 billion surplus, $12.6 billion surplus and $5.6 billion surplus. In the last five Labor budgets, Commonwealth debt was run up by $80 billion. Over the last five outcomes under this government, $57 billion of that has now been repaid. We have now repaid about six-eighths - three-quarters - of the damage of the Labor Party in its last five budgets. The Commonwealth debt position has now been reduced to 5.8 per cent of GDP - which is one of the strongest positions in the world -  and has strengthened Australia's financial position going into uncertain world events. That is much better, of course, than carrying the 20 per cent of debt to GDP ratio that was the position when the government was elected.Mr Speaker, you might think upon this outcome that you would hear from the opposition that they supported the strengthening of the Australian budget situation, particularly in the light of international events. But we had no statement of support for the effort that the government has put in place, just the usual opportunistic deceit as the Labor Party sought to extract whatever cheap political advantage they could from this situation, led on this occasion by the Leader of the Opposition, who was even more irresponsible - I know it is hard to believe - than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is a big call. After the fourth consecutive underlying surplus budget outcome and after five deficits in a row cumulating $80 billion worth of debt, the Leader of the Opposition chose himself to go out and say:What Costello and Howard have been up to all this year is weakening the Australian budgetary position.This from a man who produced two outcomes cumulating $23 billion worth of deficits when, in the last two budgets, this government has cumulated $18 billion worth of surpluses. After beginning his comments by complaining that the government was weakening the budgetary position, he finished up by calling for additional spending in relation to the tourism industry. In the curious half world of self-delusion in which he now lives, he starts his press conference calling for a stronger budget and ends by calling for more spending. Today it was more spending in the tourism industry; earlier in the week it was $200 million for Ansett; earlier in the week again it was $100 million for the Commonwealth dental health program; earlier in the week before it was underwriting the debts of Ansett, and then it was rolled backwards. He has a policy of increased expenditure, less revenue, bigger surplus, and he is against weakening the budget position!  - Why didn't we think of that? We have sat around here for five years, when all you have got to do is spend more, tax less, you will have a bigger budget surplus and you cannot be accused of weakening the budget position! We have heard it all in this self-delusional world where he moves in and out of consciousness of his omissions of the past. Because he has not faced them in the past, he cannot face them in the future - no ideas, no plans, irresponsibility, cheap political opportunism.</DOC>

 - If the member for Hotham had listened to what I had said or had read the final budget outcome, one of the reasons why the final budget outcome was much greater than we expected was that corporate profitability was higher than expected. - He interjects, `Higher taxes.' Let us just go through it. When this government was elected, the company tax rate was 36 per cent. It had been 33 per cent but, after the 1993 election when Labor took away the tax cuts, it went up to 36 per cent. We had greater than expected company tax revenue on a lower company tax rate - not on a 36 per cent company tax rate, because that was cut last year to 34 per cent and on 1 July it was cut further to 30 per cent. There were increased company tax collections on a lower company tax rate. That was the whole point that was made in relation to corporate profitability. I said that in the curious half-world that you inhabit -  - The point I am making is that corporate profitability was much greater than expected. Taking all of the companies of Australia into account, it was much greater than expected. Not only was it up, it was much greater than expected - and on a lower company tax rate. If you have a lower rate but more revenue, what does it tell you? It tells you that corporate profitability across the whole corporate sector was very strong, as in fact it was. We were asked about employment. - We were asked the question about the effect on employment. - I was talking about what the government is doing about employment. I think that is the case. The pack that has been written will show that I was asked about employment. - Yes, it was. I was asked about employment. This government does take seriously the question of employment. I think unemployment stands at about 6.8 per cent, which is too high but is much better than the 8.5 per cent when the government was elected. In its last five years, the lowest the Labor Party had been able to get the unemployment rate to was 8.5 per cent.  - I hate to tell them, but we can remind them how high they got it. They got it as high as 11.3 per cent. - The government takes employment seriously. When it came to office, unemployment was at 8.5 per cent and is now at 6.8 per cent. Over the last five years, a net total of 880,000 jobs have been created. If it could have been higher than 880,000 jobs, nobody would have been more pleased about it than us - and probably nobody would have been less pleased than the Labor Party. We think it is important to continue to create jobs in Australia, and 880,000 have been created in the last five years. Labor's unemployment rate of 8.5 per cent has been brought down to 6.8 per cent. What do we have to do to create further employment in Australia? Let me name them. Economic growth is important. What is important for economic growth? Low interest rates - low housing mortgage interest rates and low business overdraft rates. What is also good for economic growth? Low taxation. One of the best things you can do to promote companies that create jobs is to lower the company tax rate, which this government is doing.What else is important to create jobs? Taking taxes off our exports is one of the best things that we could have possibly done. I say to the farmers of Australia and the rural areas of Australia that, in a world downturn, they have performed magnificently. For the first time in their lives, they have had taxes taken off their exports under the new taxation system. What else can we do to promote jobs in Australia? Getting rid of Labor's unfair dismissal laws would be a big step forward. People are reluctant to put on employees if they are going to be sued by trade unions or held up in the courts under unfair dismissal laws.What else would be good for creating jobs in this country? The reduction of union power would be very helpful. The end of unionists running through companies conducting smash and grab raids, as they did in Victoria through Skilled Engineering, and an end to trade union officials who prop up, fund and puppeteer the Labor Party would be good for the creation of jobs in Australia. After 880,000 jobs, we believe there is further work to go. We are dedicated to doing it. We have in place the policies which will do it. The best thing that could happen would be a return of a coalition government. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The Treasurer was talking about measures that could help create further jobs. There is no doubt that, in an export economy like ours, efficient transport and efficient waterfront performance help create Australian jobs. I am delighted to be able to tell the House that the improvement in the national average crane rate in this country continues unabated. The latest Waterline records that for the third quarter in a row the average national crane rate has improved - to 26.8 containers per hour for the June quarter. This is a record of unbroken improvements over a very considerable time. I note that the Minister for Defence has a certain interest in this and smiles approvingly. Indeed, we join you in rejoicing over a better performance, which undoubtedly helps our export sector, helps create further jobs, channels further prosperity back into rural and regional areas and helps the broader economy. That improving performance has to be contrasted with what the ALP left behind: an average crane rate across the nation of 18.5 per hour; and an international reputation as being unreliable and inefficient, something that reflected very poorly upon the nation. In terms of alternative policy approaches, the ALP have never moved on this issue from their basic premise, which was that which fell in line with the union movement, when they said, I think very patronisingly, in relation to Australian workers that it was unrealistic and unworkable to expect the Australian waterfront workers to be able to deliver anything like the objective of 25 container movements an hour set by the then minister. `Un-Australian,' they said, `It can't be done in Australia.' The waterfront workers of this country have shown that it can be done, and their performance continues to improve. What an appalling reflection it is upon the ALP that, in their narrow commitment to the interests as set out by the union movement - preserving inefficient workers' arrangements on the waterfront - they were prepared to blight the future of so many export industries that needed an efficient waterfront.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question - I really do - because it enables me to try to put this very important issue of unemployment into context. Unemployment in Australia is too high. In the 5½ years that I have been Prime Minister, you will not have found me say other than that I would have always liked the unemployment rate to have been lower. We would all like it to be lower, irrespective of whether we sit on this side of the House or the other. Against the background of policies which have generated almost 900,000 new jobs over the last 5½ years, our unemployment rate is now 6.8 per cent compared with 8.5 per cent. If you say that 6.8 per cent is a crisis, the 13 years that you were in government represented economic Armageddon compared with that.I did something today that I do not always do: I read in full the editorial in the Melbourne Age. That editorial exhorted both sides of politics to have a vigorous, robust, good, open and honest debate about the future of our country over the weeks ahead. I am very happy to engage the Labor Party, whatever may occur in the weeks ahead, in a good, open and robust debate about the state of the economy. We could both start with having a sense of proportion about the challenges that face our country. Yes, we can agree that unemployment is too high. No, we should not assert that, if you have reduced the unemployment rate from 8.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent and you have generated almost 900,000 new jobs, that does not represent the making of some progress. To make that suggestion is, of course, to immediately depart from any sense of proportion and to fail the first test imposed by that editorial. Over the last couple of days the Labor Party has raised a whole lot of questions about jobs. The thrust of that has been that in some way over the last year, particularly since the introduction of the GST, there has been an oncoming job crisis in Australia. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that it has. What I did overnight, among other things, was consult the latest ABS figures on labour markets, not only in aggregate but also around Australia, because we are hearing a line coming from the opposition about regional unemployment. I am concerned about levels of regional unemployment, and they do vary. You will find that quite a number of the government's policies are directed towards dealing with the problems of regional unemployment. The latest ABS figures on regional labour markets reveal that, over the year to August 2001, metropolitan employment grew by one per cent while non-metropolitan employment rose by 0.5 per cent. Within these figures, it is apparent that some regions are in fact doing better than their metropolitan counterparts. For example, over the year to August 2001, non-metropolitan employment growth was fastest in Victoria, rising by two per cent, compared with employment growth of 1.5 per cent in Melbourne. Non-metropolitan employment increased by 1.9 per cent in Western Australia, compared with employment growth of 0.6 per cent in Perth. Non-metropolitan employment rose by 1.3 per cent in Queensland, compared with employment growth of 0.8 per cent in Brisbane.The same pattern is apparent when you look at the movement in the unemployment rates, which is, of course, the other side of the coin. The relevance of those figures is that, so far from the last year - having been the year of the introduction of the GST -  bringing about the economic doom and disaster and the mayhem that has been alleged by the Labor Party in their desperate clutch for some kind of political issue to gain some traction, the reality has been absolutely different. As I said to the member for Fowler, we do have an unemployment rate that is still too high. It is lower than what it was when we came to office. It would be even lower if we could get rid of the stupid unfair dismissal laws that we have at the present time, and it would be even lower if there were not the abuses of union power, to which my colleagues the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and the Treasurer have referred. In conclusion, I did undertake to the House to investigate the remarks of Mr Gerry Harvey. Can I give a progress report, Mr Speaker?  - It is only a progress report, because I have not been shown all of his transcripts. One of the things he said in an interview this morning was:We've got a relatively low unemployment rate.very interesting - We've got a very weak dollar, which helps us. Our exports are fantastic. The country part of Australia has never been as good as it is at the moment. I breed cattle; I breed sheep.No wonder he said that. He continues:We've never had prices as good as this. I breed horses. Our horse sale prices are at record levels, so there's a lot of room for optimism out there.I undertake to the House that, if I get further informative transcripts, I will give another progress report; meanwhile, I am part heard.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and also for the outstanding job he does as chairman of the coalition employment committee. This government has delivered more jobs, higher pay and lower taxes to Australian workers. That is a trifecta of benefits that have been delivered to Australian workers, thanks to the Howard government. The government cannot stop companies making mistakes, but what we can do is try to remove the structural impediments to more jobs in our economy.Over the last couple of days we have seen the economic vultures opposite rejoicing in a bit of bad news from the retail sector. For the record, let me say that there are 62,000 more jobs in retail today than there were 12 months ago when the GST was brought in. Let me also point out that Labor's policies would produce an unemployment cataclysm in the retail sector by abolishing youth wages. They abolished youth wages in 1993, and the policy they adopted last year to introduce comprehensive age discrimination legislation would do it again. There are 405,000 young Australians employed in retail, and the Australian Retail Association says that there would be 220,000 jobs lost in retail if a Beazley government introduced comprehensive age discrimination legislation. On top of that, Labor wants a new tax on jobs, a new payroll tax, to fund workers' entitlements. We had in March the member for Barton, the shadow Attorney-General -  -  - Yes. In March, we had the shadow Attorney-General calling for a 0.6 per cent payroll tax to fund entitlements. That was in a statement to the Illawarra Mercury on 19 March. Then we had the Leader of the Opposition calling for a 0.1 per cent payroll tax. Now we have Premier Bracks letting the cat out of the bag and calling yesterday for a 0.5 per cent payroll tax to fund entitlements. This is what Premier Bracks said yesterday: `The better scheme is for a simple surcharge of about 0.5 per cent of salary, which would go to a national insurance scheme.' So we had flip from Barton, flop from Beazley, and now flip again from Bracks. The result of this flip, flop, flip is a 0.5 per cent tax on payroll that would produce 30,000 job losses right around Australia. When it comes to employee entitlements policy, members opposite have had more contortions than a yoga class. What can you expect from a leader who is all jawbone and no backbone?</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The first point I would make is that we moved very rapidly to ensure that the regional centres right across Australia that did not have services as a result of the collapse of Ansett -  because there are no alternatives - had services. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that we have achieved, so far, very sound results. We make no apology for that. We have consistently made it plain that we are not going to buy an airline or participate in an equity injection into something that is commercially not going to stand up. Having said that, all I can add is that, plainly, we have been very keen to support seeing Ansett planes back in the skies. But it has to be on the basis that it is a commercial reality, and that is for the administrator to determine. They have indicated to our officials - and I and other senior ministers will be talking to them later today - a couple of proposals that they have got which do not in any sense depend upon us rebuilding or subsidising a commercial outcome. I think it is very important to make that point. The next point that I want to make is this: the Leader of the Opposition would have the Australian people believe that he has a plan and that his plan would produce Ansett revitalised out of the ashes, presumably much as it was. That plan would see the federal government providing either $150 million or $200 million - either a loan or equity - to an unidentified commercial party who may or may not have a proposal to take over part or all of Ansett. - The Leader of the Opposition made it plain, in an interview with journalists, that this should happen whether or not the operation proposed was commercially viable. That is not a plan; yet we are told that, somehow or other, two astonishing things would happen: firstly, this would see the instant restoration of Ansett as it was; secondly, it could all be presumed to be quite possible, provided only that Ansett was freed of its debts. That is the extraordinary part of it. The $2 billion of debt was going to just disappear. He said - it is very interesting - that this question of debt was one that the administrator would have to resolve with Air New Zealand and the other parties. He said, `All those other issues of debt and the rest of it would have to be worked through in their discussions and consultation.' That $2 billion is not just some other issue. It is not just something for someone else to resolve. If Ansett was not saddled with that debt, it would still be flying. It cannot be simply passed away.The one aspect of this is that it gives us something of an idea about how the Leader of the Opposition thinks. He can put these staggering amounts of debt to one side and say, `They are somebody else's worry,' which is precisely what he did in 1996. The deficit, their borrowings - they were all to be for somebody else to worry about and for somebody else to fix up. Who were they? The Liberal-National Party in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. His electorate of Grey, in South Australia, relies very heavily on the support of Australia's export industries. It is of paramount importance that any Australian government provides a sound economic environment from which its businesses and exporters can compete in the world marketplace. The coalition government, over the last five years, has done that. Last year's statistics on our exports prove the point that sound economic management has delivered a significant reduction in the impact of taxation on individuals and on Australia's corporations, and it has delivered a stable economic environment that is conducive to a low level of interest rates. Most importantly, and on a day when we hear an announcement about the improved efficiency of the waterfront, it has delivered workplace relations reform by creating a much better and more competitive environment for Australia's exporters. They are all vitally important as far as the Australian economy is concerned. Australia's exporters are underpinning the strength of the Australian economy in the face of the uncertain times that we are confronted with as a nation. Last year, Australia's exports rose by 23 per cent. Last year, we exported $153 billion worth of goods and services out of this country. So Mr Gerry Harvey was not telling fibs; he was telling the truth. -  - Some of those exports out of rural Australia were horses, for those on the Labor side of the House that do not understand what our export effort is made up of. Our agricultural producers, of whom the honourable member is one, earned $28.5 billion for this country; that is $28.5 billion worth of agricultural exports for Australia. But it is not just agriculture - this government has encouraged and diversified the base of exports from this country so that it is not just commodity based, and that is an argument that we continue to run. Our automotive exports last year earned $4.2 billion - a hell of a lot more than what it was under the last Labor government. In Australia's wine industry - which is very relevant to South Australia, where the questioner comes from - there were $1.4 billion worth of exports last year. One of the standout sectors as far as our exports are concerned is the education sector. There were $3.7 billion worth of education services exported out of Australia. Those exports sustained almost two million jobs. That is a 23 per cent increase in exports and an increase in jobs that are reliant on export industries in Australia. In answer to the question, it is absolutely essential that governments maintain a policy of sound economic management to maintain the right economic environment for our exporters to be competitive in the international marketplace, a marketplace that is becoming increasingly tougher and uncertain in the days that we live in at the moment.I was asked about alternative policies, but it is hard to find any. We have seen the Labor spokesman on trade have about three or four different positions in terms of our trade relationships with some of our major partners. When the Bush administration was elected in the US, he said on 15 November:Australia needs to seize the opportunity provided by a new US administration to explore the options of a free trade relationship with the United States.That is exactly what our government is trying to do with our second largest trading partner. We are doing a lot more in progressing this issue than the Labor Party ever did. We are making great inroads in that regard. Once the government started making progress, their spokesman flipped back the other way and started to undermine it. The commentary of the Labor Party's spokesman at the US-Australia leadership dialogue this year was a disgrace to the national interest. Led by the member for Hotham and Senator Cook, he undermined the position of the Australian government and the Australian people in our relationship with the US. - The member for Griffith was there. - They were having a debate amongst themselves in front of our visitors from America about what should and should not be done, and he is saying, `You fool.' They are talking about the relationship with East Asia and what should and should not be done. Our government has embarked upon a process of improving the relationship with Japan, with Korea and with China - the ASEAN countries - something the Labor Party in government never did. They never got near striking a framework agreement with the ASEAN countries, which we have recently done. Far from having a coherently structured set of trade policies, far from supporting an economic framework in Australia that is conducive to our exports, the Labor Party have opposed at every turn the things that we have done as a government to improve the opportunities for our exporters. The Labor Party have opposed making our ports more efficient by waterfront reform, they have opposed taking $3.5 billion worth of taxes off our exporters, they have opposed sensible workplace relations reforms for small business and they have opposed the broad trade agenda that our government has embarked upon. My advice to Australia's exporters is to stay in touch with customers, to keep doing the hard work that they have been doing, and last, but not least - most importantly - to not vote Labor. </DOC>

 - This gives me an opportunity to reiterate, for those who have not been listening, what the government is doing. In this current situation, brought about by the Ansett collapse and subsequently the fallout from that for our domestic aviation sector, which saw 40 per cent of the aviation market go down, we have seen our Minister for Transport and Regional Services underwrite about $10 million in loans for Kendell, Hazelton and Skywest to get a lot of services back. I understand that some 90 per cent of Ansett's capacity -  -  - As I mentioned, by this Thursday industry assessment is that 90 per cent of Ansett's capacity will be restored. In that environment one of the key things that that working group came up with was to do an assessment of the impact on individual businesses in terms of revenue, employment and forward bookings. I would like to quote the CEO of our ATC, who stressed that the first thing they need is to have a current and accurate insight into what is happening in our markets and the second is to use this analysis to identify opportunities for Australia. As was mentioned at the first meeting last Friday, this survey process was undertaken and it is currently under way in terms of seeing what is the exact fallout and the exact impact on it. In the meantime, this government has underwritten $400 million of workers' entitlements. That is something that did not occur when Budget went under, when Compass 1, Compass 2 and Qintex and all the related tourism jobs -   - The relevance of what the government is doing is in that we had done extensive remediation work in the previous two weeks. Certainly we are getting assessment of where we are at the moment, and that industry working group is basically getting itself to a stage where it can identify possible industry or government solutions based on feedback from surveys and market intelligence.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his interest and obvious concern about the events of 11 September. Despite it being more than two weeks since the tragic events on 11 September, many Australians continue to feel great sadness and sympathy for the more than 6,000 innocent people who lost their lives to terrorism in New York, Washington and Pittsburgh. Of course, our thoughts pass to the families of those killed, who are suffering from the loss of a loved one.More than any other sector, the financial services community was hit hard by the tragic September events. The World Trade Centre was the workplace of thousands of financial service personnel and, as many people would be aware, of the feared 23 Australians who lost their lives, a number of these victims worked in the financial services industry, both in New York and, previously, in Australia.I am pleased to advise the House that Australia's major financial associations, including the Stock Exchange and the Futures Exchange, banks, insurance companies and insurance brokers, and funds managers, analysts and traders have come together with the Australian Red Cross to provide a support fund for the victims of 11 September. Fifty per cent of the funds donated will support the efforts of the United States Red Cross and 50 per cent will go to the Australian Red Cross for the support of Australian victims' families. In response to a request from the financial services industry and the Australian Red Cross, the Prime Minister has agreed that all donations to the fund will be tax deductible.There are 330,000 people who work in the financial services industry in Australia, including a number of people in the electorate of Macquarie - in fact, the member for Macquarie used to work in the financial services industry himself - and all of the people in the industry have a special affinity with so many of the victims in the United States. Many of these victims were part of the global financial community and, as colleagues, business counterparts and friends in Australia, we wish to provide our support.  When the tragedy struck, the Red Cross in the United States stepped in to provide food, water and shelter for the thousands of survivors. The Red Cross provided counselling for families and, where necessary, blood products to the injured. Moreover, the Red Cross, both here in Australia and in the United States, is continuing to support the families of victims with whatever is necessary to help them through the ordeal. Any ongoing support to the Red Cross will be gratefully received. Donations by any Australian can be made by telephone 24 hours a day on 1800 811700 or over the Internet on ourcommunity.com.au. All donations made since 11 September - technically, 10 September - and going forward are now fully tax deductible.</DOC>

 - The paper to which the member for Dobell refers is a paper requested not by me but by my department -  -  - The department requested this paper following an approach from the author and it asked him to put the comments that he had made in writing so they could be fully analysed. The author of that paper makes a number of technical comments about the SES index. The assumption that he makes in that paper which is quoted by the member for Dobell is that, if the index had been based on the technical features that he advocates, there could be significant departures from the outcomes of the Farish model on which the SES is based and that his model might produce significantly different results. I have had this model fully analysed and I have to report that there are discrepancies in the results of the model that he advocates compared to the Farish model - but the discrepancies are tiny. The outcomes of the two models correlate at a .999 level. In other words, the outcomes of the two models are essentially identical. I am very happy to make our analysis of this model available. I shall have it sent into the House, and I will table it at the end of question time.The member for Dobell asks about funding models. The real comparison is between the fair, just and transparent model which we now have and the model that the Labor Party had when they were in office. That was a funding model that was so totally discredited that it was abandoned by the entire non-government sector. It was a funding model that said that a community based school on the Darling Downs was one of the richest schools in Australia. It was a funding model that said that Loretto Kirribilli was a much poorer school than this community school on the Darling Downs. It was a funding model that allocated schools with the same need scores to half a dozen different funding categories. It was a funding model that was so politically corrupted that new schools were simply not funded at their identified needs level.This is a question from a political party which has totally lost sight of what is important in school funding and which seeks to distract attention from the fact that it is at this very moment in the Senate denying funding to an Aboriginal community school in Australia which is one of the poorest schools in the country. This is a totally opportunistic party that thinks it has its hands on something that proves one point but in fact proves nothing at all. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and also take the opportunity to remark upon her great support for defence and particularly to people in her electorate. I have read the report. She did a great job when she went to the Northern Territory with a construction team. It is an important question. In respect of HMAS Anzac,I have advised the House previously that we extended her deployment in the Persian Gulf. We have done that a couple of times. US Central Command has come back to us again for a further extension, which the government has agreed to, and that is an extension of the deployment until the end of October 2001. Importantly, we have also been requested to provide a replacement for HMAS Anzac,and the government has agreed to that. The CDF is putting the necessary plans in place so that we can have a follow-on to the work of HMAS Anzac in the Persian Gulf. I want to pay tribute to the crew and the work they are doing in the sanctions business which they have been employed in. I also want to say to the families that we appreciate that the crews are going to be away for another month, but they are doing a fantastic job. We do greatly appreciate the work they are doing.I also advise the House that the Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, will arrive in Washington later this week, on 30 September. He is going to Washington via Jakarta, where he will be holding discussions with counterparts and officials, and obviously the visit to Washington will provide him with an opportunity not just to attend the farewell of the outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, but obviously to have discussions with his counterparts in Washington.I am also asked an important question about capability. I draw the attention of the House to my concerns which we have seen foreshadowed this week by the Leader of the Opposition in respect of patrol boats. The government has recently issued a tender for the replacement of the 15 patrol boats that are an important part of the work of the Royal Australian Navy. That tender is out with industry. Not only is it important to the Royal Australian Navy; it is also important to industry, as we expect those patrol boat replacements to be constructed and built in Australia. I am very concerned about the Leader of the Opposition's statements, because he has made it quite clear that he does not agree with the specifications within that tender documentation and that the Labor Party, if elected, would look to change the tender arrangements for the replacements. The Leader of the Opposition is proposing that, rather than the Royal Australian Navy have its replacement patrol boats, some different form of vessel be constructed and assigned not to the Royal Australian Navy but to an organisation which the Labor Party wants to set up with a large bureaucracy to manage it.In the defence of Australia's northern approaches, the work that is done in respect of people-smuggling and the work that is done in respect of fisheries, narcotics and other matters, the Royal Australian Navy's patrol boats perform an absolutely vital function. I think it is a gross act of irresponsibility on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to throw into doubt a critical part of the capability of the Royal Australian Navy. When the question of the coastguard was being contemplated back in 1984, when looking at the options for a coastguard the now Leader of the Opposition said, `I am less convinced that they would lead to a system that would better counter the traffic in narcotics and sustain the kind of littoral surveillance evidently necessary for other purposes as well.' He was opposed to a coastguard in 1984. Then, on 19 August this year, he went from the flip to the flop. He said:When are they going to get real and put in a coastguard? There are a lot of people entering this country illegally who do not get caught. What we now need is a much better border protection effort.A week or so later he voted against a border protection bill. And 11 days later, when pressed on the question of a coastguard, which he had said we needed to deal with the people entering the country illegally, he said these words:A coastguard is not a resolution to this problem.So, in other words, one minute he is flip - he is advocating a coastguard; 11 days later, he is saying it is not a resolution of the problem he himself has identified.The patrol boats do a fantastic job for this country. They do a professional job for this country. Apart from the capability that they bring, they give our young people coming up through the Navy the opportunity to command. They give real benefits of instruction and exercise on operations for our navigators and for our crews. They are a vital part of the Royal Australian Navy. I think it is an act of gross irresponsibility to gut the Royal Australian Navy of a key part of its operations.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am a great believer in public education. I have three children in the Mullaley Public School. I am in fact very proud to be married to a schoolteacher. But let me make these general comments acknowledging the importance of education. I have to say that I think we ought to recognise, and I do think that some of those who seem to have political barrows to push might be little more honest in recognising, that the way we have divided things up in this country is to leave the responsibility of funding the state system to the states. Indeed, in that regard, one of the comments I would make - since you raise the issue and you have given me a pretty wide remit, I have to say, by definition of the question - is that there is one area in New South Wales where I would very much like to see the state government spend more. That is capital expenditure on state schools, where I think we have been making a very big contribution to the state system and where I notice that, in its usual city-centric way, Labor in New South Wales is very reluctant to spend money on the capital infrastructure of schools west of the divide in New South Wales.The public school that I attended in Gunnedah, quite a big public school, to this day does not have a decent assembly hall. Despite the efforts of local representatives and the local Independent member, nothing is being done about it. I am aware that the activities of the ALP are resulting in the blocking of funding for a small independent school in Gladstone, in the seat of the member for Hinkler. They are looking for about $15,000 of funding. It is not a wealthy school - it really needs that money - and the member for Hinkler and his constituents would concur with that, yet the question has to be asked: why are those opposite not prepared to support it? In general, I believe that the Prime Minister's remarks were absolutely accurate. I am a very strong believer in both streams -  the independent and non-independent streams - of education in this country. I strongly believe that there is a lack of integrity on the part of some of those who try to imply that we do not do enough for the state school system, when they consistently refuse to point to the simple reality that the state system is funded by state governments. They are on a better funding stream than ever before. They get all the GST revenues. They ought to be prepared to deploy those as generously as we have in ensuring that Australian parents have genuine choice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He has a very strong interest in defence matters, particularly the welfare of Defence personnel. I made a very good visit to the electorate of Herbert a couple of weeks ago, when we visited Lavarack Barracks and opened some important new facilities that will benefit not only the families but also the soldiers of the 3rd Brigade. The government take very seriously our responsibility in recruiting, training and, importantly, retaining members of the Australian Defence Force. We made that very clear in the Defence white paper that we released at the end of last year. The government are committed to a strong Australian Defence Force that can protect Australia and Australia's interests in these very uncertain times and at the same time make sure that the Australian Defence Force is an attractive employment choice for young Australians. Therefore, I am pleased to advise the House that recruiting initiatives are currently producing outstanding results in what has been a very challenging recruiting environment. We have a strong economy, declining numbers of young people in Australia and low unemployment, so it is a very challenging time. The results of the last financial year are outstanding: 7,695 young Australians joined the Australian Defence Force. That represents a 33 per cent increase in recruiting in the last financial year. These results are continuing in this financial year. In the first 10 weeks of this financial year, more than 1,700 young Australians joined the Australian Defence Force. That is another outstanding result. Those numbers are a 30 per cent increase over those for last year. They demonstrates that initiatives are working. The other great challenge at the moment is that the Australian Defence Force general entry initial training facilities are full to capacity, which is very rare at this time of year, and they are expected to remain so until December, which is normally the peak recruiting time. Part of the reason for that is the recruiting campaign that has based its advertising on real-life testimonies from people who are currently serving in the Australian Defence Force. Another important element is the new Defence call centre in Cooma, in the electorate of the member for Eden-Monaro. It is playing a very important role in significantly improving inquiry processing time. That is also contributing to the outstanding result that we have seen in the last 12 months. Another policy initiative is a pilot program to evaluate the use of a commercial provider for elements of the recruiting process. That pilot program will continue for another 12 months. The Australian Defence Force is continuing to streamline and, more importantly, enhance its recruiting processes. We believe that those excellent results will continue well into December and into the new year.This government's commitment to the Australian Defence Force and its success in attracting young Australians to join the Australian Defence Force are in stark contrast with the Australian Labor Party's ad hoc approach to defence. The opposition leader's and the Labor Party's proposition to establish a coastguard is another example of Labor's failure to recognise the professionalism and the capability of the Australian Defence Force. That is what you are doing: failing to recognise the professionalism and the capability of serving members of the Australian Defence Force. - It stands in very stark contrast with this government's support for the Australian Defence Force. The government recognises and commends members of the Australian Defence Force who engage in border protection duties for their commitment and professionalism. The government holds them out to all young Australians as great examples and hopes that they will see an opportunity and a career path in the Australian Defence Force.</DOC>

 - I can confirm that, as the Minister for Sport and Tourism indicated, there were some industry sources suggesting that we may be able to achieve that figure by tomorrow. I have to say that our latest advice - Opposition members - Who? - It was a Qantas source; I needn't say any more than that. It was -  -  - In my view, it is the case that we are moving towards that sort of capacity -  -  - I would have thought that with all their professed concern, particularly for the tourism industry, they might have been interested in and concerned about every effort we can make to get people back into the skies. But the reality is that from go to whoa, like their mates in the trade union movement, their only interest is in trying to score political points out of this entire exercise. Their political cynicism stands paralleled only by their lack of any concrete and constructive approaches and planning in all of this in terms of taking the issue forward. It is really just appalling, as everyone who has listened to them flipping and flopping all over the place on this in recent days - and more flopping than flipping - will be aware. We are doing everything we can to rebuild capacity -  -  - A large number of measures, including using larger planes on existing routes -  -  - Larger planes, and more planes, are being brought on stream all the time. - As I have quite clearly indicated, there have been indications -  - from industry that they believe that that was achievable. It is our view that that is slightly optimistic over the next few days -  - but we are rapidly building towards it. There are a large number of potential new planes including, we hope, if the administrator can bring it together, Ansett planes to go back into the sky. Virgin is looking to increase its capacity. Qantas has brought extra planes on and they are substituting and rearranging their mixes so that they can put larger planes on many legs. I would have thought that all of the efforts, adding to what we have been able to do on the regionals to ensure that people can move around, to increase capacity, in the interests of the travelling public and particularly of the tourism industry, about which they profess such concerns, would have been welcomed by everyone in the House.</DOC>

 - I would agree that the signature of that treaty would be an important symbolic contribution to that fight. I think it is also the case, as I am sure the Leader of the Opposition would agree, that specific practical measures taken by governments are also very important in the fight against terrorism. My understanding - and I will check that understanding with the Acting Foreign Minister - is that the failure to sign that treaty, if that is the case, is not the result of any opposition to the principles of it. But I will check that further with the acting minister.</DOC>

 - I regret to say that there is a threat - and that threat is over there. Those who sit opposite are blocking in another place establishment grants to 54 non-government schools spread across Australia. We are dealing here with schools that are by no possible description wealthy elite schools; we are dealing with, for example, two Catholic systemic schools, low fee Christian community schools, non-denominational independent schools, an indigenous community school in the Kimberley and a Jewish day school. The average payment owing to these schools is about $14,000. That is not an enormous amount, but it is an enormous amount to a poor, low fee paying school and to the parents associated with them, who are not wealthy and are not high income earners. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Leader of the Opposition would allow his party in the Senate to block a measure helping struggling independent schools. That is what the Labor Party is doing. The Labor Party says that in education all it wants to do is to block payments to so-called wealthy schools. I debate the wisdom of that proposition and even the accuracy of that description. But you are not even talking about that here; you are talking about denying money to needy independent schools and you are denying money to the parents of students at needy independent schools. Last month the Leader of the Opposition, in a personal explanation, said:... the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has said ... that I am threatening the funds to Catholic schools and to low income private schools. We are not; we support the grants that go to those schools. - The member for Dobell says that he will give it. You have an opportunity in the Senate this afternoon to give it. You have an opportunity to withdraw your opposition. I say to the hundreds, indeed the thousands, of parents with students at these schools: if you do not get your establishment grants, write a letter of complaint to the Leader of the Opposition and write to your Labor Party senators. Remember those Labor Party senators without affection - indeed, remember the Labor Party without affection - when you cast your vote. By its blocking of this legislation, the Labor Party is proving itself the enemy of the battling parents of Australia who want choice in relation to their schools. </DOC>

 - May I say that I am overwhelmed with the assumption implicit in the question of the member for Kingsford-Smith that I can speak in detail and with authority on behalf of the United States administration. I will not presume to do that, but what I will presume to do -  - If I heard the member for Melbourne correctly, and perhaps I did not because I sometimes do not, I do not regard the United States as having war aims. I think that is unreasonable and inaccurate. That is a wholly unjustified characterisation of the attitude of the United States. What I regard the United States as being on about, and it is my understanding what the Leader of the Opposition regards the United States as being on about, is a legitimate response to what is an open assault upon its territorial integrity. The goals of the United States are to achieve, to the extent that it can, a comprehensive defeat of terrorism and, taken outside the boundaries of those countries from which the terrorists operate against other countries, the most comprehensive defeat possible. The member for Kingsford-Smith asked me whether it is one of the aims to bring about the downfall of the existing regime in Afghanistan. I would have to say to the member that it would appear from all of the available evidence that that would be a result the United States would not be displeased with, and I have to say that it may not necessarily be a result that Australia would be displeased with. The existing regime, the Taliban, in Afghanistan has harboured, relieved, comforted, protected and generally given political and economic succour to Osama bin Laden and those associated with him.The United States - correctly, in my view - in a very painstaking and methodical manner is assembling a very effective international coalition. The description of the way in which the United States has gone about this task was very well expressed this morning on Radio National, when there was an interview with the former American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrook, who was speaking as a private citizen but also as a Democrat, and certainly not as an apologist for the administration. I thought it was a very timely and instructive interview from his own perspective, from somebody who is not unfamiliar - being the architect of the Dayton peace accord - with the difficulties of assembling international consensus. He made the very legitimate point, with which I totally agree, that the Bush administration had been extremely successful in its task so far in assembling an international coalition.I think the Bush administration has also been very successful in not locking itself into one particular approach and not signalling one particular approach. I think the best result will be achieved if as many nations as possible on as broad a front as possible can be assembled in order to deal in different ways and at different times with the problem of terrorism. That involves not only the assembly of military might within an international coalition but also assembling internal political opposition to those who would bring about comfort and protection for those who are responsible for terrorism. You would have to be a pretty courageous person to imagine that we could get any lasting peace after what has gone on between Israel and the Palestinians, but the tentative signs of the agreement that has come out of the meeting between Arafat and Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, are encouraging. If that goes on, it will make a contribution to a greater commitment by the more moderate Arab states and the more moderate Arab leadership to the antiterrorist cause. I regard the involvement of more moderate Arab opinion and the more moderate Arab states in the alliance against terrorism as being extremely important. I know from recollection that that is a view that the member for Kingsford-Smith holds, and I think it is important. My answer to the member for Kingsford-Smith is that the United States have, if I may say so, very wisely gone about this in a very methodical fashion. They have not irretrievably committed themselves to one particular course of action. Their resolve to retaliate and their resolve to strike as hard as humanly possible against those responsible for these terrible atrocities can be undoubted. In that endeavour they will have the total support of the Australian government and, I know, the Australian parliament. But it is not something that necessarily has to be accomplished within a matter of days or, indeed, within a matter of weeks; it is not necessarily something that can be. You need to try to strike at the available power of terrorists but you also need to strike at some of the conditions that make it possible for terrorists to prosper. You also have to try to address in the longer term some of the fundamental disputes between nations and peoples that have given rise to terrorism. I know that all members of this House share the sense of foreboding that the community has about these events. I am encouraged by the strength and, dare I say it, the international diplomatic maturity that the United States have displayed in assembling this coalition, and that gives me very great heart for a successful outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. I can inform him that yesterday's final budget outcome showed that revenue raised from GST was $23.7 billion compared with a budget forecast of $24.0 billion - a margin of error of only one per cent in the first year of collection of the GST. Over the last three years, this parliament has radically reshaped the Australian taxation system. We have abolished wholesale sales tax and replaced it with a goods and services tax. That has allowed us to abolish bed taxes, financial institutions duties and stamp duties on marketable securities. We have cut personal income tax by $12 billion and have taken average wage earners from a 43 per cent marginal rate to a 30 per cent rate. We have cut capital gains tax in half for individuals and freed small business from capital gains tax when they sell to retire. In addition to that, we have cut the company tax rate from 36 per cent to 34 per cent, and then from 34 per cent to 30 per cent. Throughout the work of this parliament in reforming and reshaping Australia's tax system, we have been opposed by the Australian Labor Party at every step of the way.The Australian Labor Party has flipped and flopped on taxation policy as it has flipped and flopped on so much else. Remember that there used to be a policy that was talked about nearly every day in this parliament, which we have not heard for a long while. It begins with `r': roll-back. We have not heard about the policy of roll-back. Kim Beazley, in an address to the nation on 8 July 1999 said:Labor's commitment will be to roll back the GST.On 19 June 2000, he said:... we know there will be roll back under a Labor government - that is an absolute commitment. We have said this is our top priority.Yet it is a top priority that dare not speak its name.I have gone through the announcements that the Labor Party has now made in relation to roll-back and, out of a revenue take of $24 billion, the Labor Party proposes to roll back $125 million or 0.52 per cent. In other words, roll-back now consists of 0.52 per cent and, all along, the Labor Party has agreed with us 99.5 per cent of the time. That is the flip and the flop or, in this case, the roll-back flip and the roll-back flop; more flops than flips. When it comes to rolling back the GST, there is no roll-backbone. After opposing GST, the Labor Party, we now find, is to keep 99.5 per cent of the changes which this government has put in place. The Australian editorial on 26 September, entitled `See-through Beazley needs flesh strategy', finished by saying: Labor's GST roll-back policy is a joke, and the party's frontbench knows it.I table the editorial.</DOC>

 - I inform the honourable member that, as a result of the terrorist attack on 11 September, a process of reviewing all of the responses in the agencies of the Commonwealth to terrorist threats was put in place, including and in particular an examination of whether any changes to laws dealing with suspected terrorist activity might be required. I can inform the Leader of the Opposition that, on Tuesday when it meets in Sydney, the cabinet will be examining some advice on that particular issue received from the Attorney-General. All the issues raised by the Leader of the Opposition are generally under examination and, as a result of that, some changes will be needed. Whenever something like this happens, which is completely without warning - I do not think anybody in this House, except in the most general sense of the word, expected something like this to happen - the natural instinct is to look at everything. The result will be that some changes will be made. Some of the things suggested by the Leader of the Opposition could well be the subject of change.The Leader of the Opposition, in accordance with a request from me, will be kept briefed, as is the custom and as is appropriate, by the head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I know that he will accept my assurance that, if there are any concrete proposals for particular changes to reform that he thinks are desirable, we will pick them up. We do not pretend that every conceivable response to terrorism was in place before 11 September. Nobody could pretend that - the United States obviously could not and no free nation in the world could. One of the terrible things about this kind of terrorism is that you can conceive of a situation where it is virtually impossible to have comprehensive protection against it. But I can assure the Leader of the Opposition, and through him the members of the House, that we will not leave any stone unturned to make sure that all the protection is available, including increased close personal protection for people who are regarded at risk, increased guarding of American assets and increased responses in relation to Israeli establishments and Jewish assets in Australia.I am concerned, as I know he is, about actual and threatened acts of violence and destruction against property belonging to Islamic Australians, and I can say to Australians in the Islamic community that all the additional protection that can be provided will be provided. That will be done primarily by the police services of the various states, but acting in cooperation with the police services of the Commonwealth. I also inform him in the House that senior ministers received a comprehensive briefing from all of the relevant agencies, including the Queensland Police Service, regarding the adequacy of security arrangements for the CHOGM meeting. There is no domestic security reason why that meeting should not take place, and it remains my hope that the meeting will take place. The question of whether there will be any fall-off in attendances over the days ahead as a result of events in the United States is a situation that has to yet unfold.  It remains my hope that the meeting will go ahead, but I am sure the Leader of the Opposition will appreciate that, in the current circumstances, some participants may feel constrained not to attend. If the number and the influence of those who decide not to attend is such as to pose some threat to the value of the meeting, that may well cause the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth to have another view. It is impossible for me in relation to that particular event to say any more at the present time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As has been widely reported today, last night we entered into arrangements with the administrator, negotiated last night, to return five Ansett A320s to service this weekend and another six over the following week. This is a limited but significant and commercially well-constructed exercise, and the administrator is confident that it can be made to work. Having looked at it, we agree with him that it is worthy of support. On that basis, we have agreed to inject confidence, by standing behind those who would purchase tickets, to the tune of $25 million over the next 12 weeks. Indeed, so confident is the administrator in his position that he has indemnified us - on behalf of our representing the taxpayers, of course - on the basis of security against assets. This is a very welcome development. It means that another 1,500 Ansett employees will return to work.The federal government, as we have worked through this, has assisted in the restoration of services by Skywest in Western Australia. I know it is very important to Barry Haase, the member for Kalgoorlie, and to others in the biggest of the states in the Commonwealth. Hazelton in New South Wales are gradually unfolding their services again in a very welcome way. Kendell is starting and has some way to go. The member for Riverina has been very keen to work through further opportunities for Kendell, and she has been endless in her pursuit of that objective - we are doing what we can. I am advised now that 90 people at Hazelton, 101 at Kendell and 146 at Skywest are back at work, and Skywest is recruiting former Ansett staff. Add to that 750 people involved in Traveland and nearly 500 who have now found employment with Qantas, and 3,000, in all, from Ansett are now working again in aviation. I hope that is welcomed by everyone in this House.There is still a long way to go, but I think it is quite reasonable to say that there has been a good start by the parties involved - by the administrators, by the government and by the airline operators. There are a couple of exceptions to those parties that have not made worthwhile contributions to this. One party has made a lot of noise but has made no worthwhile contribution, and that is the ACTU. For all their noise, all the criticism, all the rallies and all the so-called plans, the one thing that can be said of the ACTU is that we cannot identify a single job that they have helped to restore - not one. I would be delighted if the ACTU's involvement had got anyone back to work. I would be the first to give them credit for it, but it seems that they are determined to be part of the problem and not part of the solution. This is a very important point. Last night, Greg Combet's attitude appears to have been reflected in the comment that he made. He said:The planes will fly with Ansett crew under existing Ansett certified agreements. That has always been the position.Blind Freddy knows that major changes in work practices in the interests of Ansett employees and their future are absolutely necessary in these circumstances. The question has to be asked: does the ACTU really want them back at work? Will they now commit themselves, as other parties have, to trying to work through this in the interests of Ansett employees, of the travelling public and of competitive aviation?  -  - I have some useful quotes here and I am coming to another one in a moment. Is it the case that the ACTU's real -  - Mr Speaker, whenever they think there is a quote coming that relates to somebody in the Labor movement, they start making a lot of noise. An example of the ACTU being more interested in politics than in policy outcomes is to be found in a rally yesterday. The ACTU got a bit of a protest rally going outside the member for Lindsay's office in Penrith. The protest took place and then the protesters, having concluded, got back on the bus. - It is very obvious that the opposition do not want to hear what these people have been saying. The protest over, the leader of the ACTU, Sharan Burrows, and her group got back on the bus. But a television crew arrived late, so they all got off the bus again and trooped over to the other side of the road and got the whole protest going again. The centrepiece of the protest was a letter that was intended for delivery to the member, and the camera crew asked the logical question: `Could we have the letter?' But Ms Burrows replied, `No, you can't have the letter. We are only doing this for the camera.'</DOC>

 - Perhaps in answer to the Leader of the Opposition I could simply point out that it is all the administrator asked for. - Of course we asked. We have spent our time in constant communication with all of the parties to work this through constructively, to take every available opportunity to get aeroplanes back in the sky, to get workers back in -  - `No you haven't,' he said. What was the Leader of the Opposition's response when he was asked, `Have you spoken to any of the parties?' in a doorstop the other day? He said, `Well, no, but some of my people have been talking to some of their people.'We have sought at all times to work constantly through many hours with all of the affected parties. I have just listed for the House the progress that we have made, but the Leader of the Opposition would have you believe that he has a plan. The problem with the plan is that it has varied every day. It has never been a constant. It has never stood up to any scrutiny. It is not based on any understanding of the facts because, as he has revealed when asked, he has not spoken to the major players in this. All I can say is that the most useful thing I could do is to offer - I am sure the administrator would be agreeable -  to arrange a full briefing for the Leader of the Opposition so that he can come to grips with the realities of what actually happened to Ansett, inasmuch as the administrator has been able to establish, so that he has some understanding of what we were asked for and some view of the best possible future, as the administrator is working to put it together, so that we can have a worthwhile debate about this instead of empty rhetoric from him and cheap rallies from the ACTU. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The final budget outcome 2000-01 reveals that Defence had an expenditure of $13.25 billion in cash terms for the last year. - These funds are available because we have had responsible economic management by the Commonwealth. As a result of that, we have an economy that is as strong as, if not stronger than, most within the OECD. That has put this government in a position to invest in the defences of our country. That is what has happened. The May budget delivered the first round of funding after the white paper was brought down last year, and the government fully met the commitments it made in the white paper to fund that white paper to ensure that the capability we propose for defence is in fact fully resourced. The white paper has proposed an additional $27 billion over the coming decade. It is the most significant statement of government policy on defence literally for decades. It will see the Australian Defence Force armed with new airborne early warning and control aircraft. - You ought to read the white paper. It might give the Labor Party an understanding of the importance of the white paper and why they ought to be sticking to it. It also provides for up to 100 new fighters, it provides for armed reconnaissance helicopters - and we are well advanced in the acquisition of those - it provides for unmanned surveillance aircraft of the Global Hawk type and it provides for new and replacement patrol boats for the Royal Australian Navy. We have also budgeted for increases to our special forces and to defence intelligence gathering agencies.I am asked what alternative proposals there are and what is my response to those. There is a response from the opposition. It is a response which you could only describe as wishy-washy. It is a response which says, `Oh, yeah, we support the white paper,' but, when you read the details, they have strapped to their policy pronouncements a whole range of commitments which cannot be funded - which will not be funded - by the Labor Party unless they decide to eat into the white paper. For example, we saw the Leader of the Opposition in Adelaide - I think it was last year - promising an extra couple of submarines -  - seemingly oblivious to the fact that, with those sort of purchases -  - you would wipe out the whole of the Royal Australian Navy's capability enhancements for a decade or more. We saw the opposition spokesman promising that they would keep the HMAS Jervis Bay - the catamaran. - Oh, `Not true'? - A cost of $80 million -  - The Labor Party has a whole lot of commitments for which they have no money. They have a commitment to move the Air Force bombing range at Salt Ash near Newcastle - a cost of around a billion dollars and no money to pay for it.   - They are proposing an Anzac battalion - half a billion dollars and no money to pay for it. Of course, this week they have gone further with their coastguard proposal. It now seems, from their words, that if Labor is elected they will basically scrap the tender that we have already got out for the replacement of patrol boats. If anybody knows anything about the Navy, they will understand that patrol boats are a vital component -  - of the work of the Royal Australian Navy. - These are Labor Party so-called promises and, in respect of the patrol boats, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister have made it very clear that they do not accept the government's proposals in the tender that we have issued. This is a very serious matter that goes to the heart of the capability of the Royal Australian Navy. Yesterday the shadow minister put out a press release which said that with the new bureaucratic system, Coast Guard, which they will establish, they are hoping to lure members of the Royal Australian Navy across out of the Navy - out of the Australian Defence Force - to man it. -  - It is in his press release! Not only are they now proposing to gut the Australian Navy of its patrol boat fleet but, furthermore, they plan to civilianise -  - up to 600 members of the Royal Australian Navy and put them into their new bureaucratic structure called Australian Coast Guard. What is this - roll-back for the Navy? I think it is grossly irresponsible, and not only is that the assessment that we would put on it; if you read what the Leader of the Opposition himself said when he had responsibility for this issue back in the 1980s, even he was opposed to it.The white paper is the best thing that has happened to the Australian Defence Force in decades. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to make an unequivocal statement which will commit any future Labor government to that white paper. It is great to have for an organisation a plan for the future and I think it is grossly irresponsible for them to throw clouds of doubt over the future of the Australian Defence Force and its white paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The undertaking given by Hazelton in response for our support was that they would unfold their routes as rapidly as possible. Our understanding is that they intend to restore all, with possibly only one question mark, but they are to come back to us on that. The particular request that we made of them was that they would move first to restore services to communities that had no service, and that is what they are seeking to do. It is my understanding that, by the end of next week, they will basically have unrolled all services.  I cannot tell you whether or not they will have Bathurst restored by this weekend. I will seek to engage with them this afternoon and then provide the honourable member with a direct answer, because as to timing I am not quite certain. The reason that it has proved a little difficult to get a Bathurst service back is that it is relatively close to Orange. In fact, the driving time between Orange and Bathurst is less than a lot of people in capital cities spend in getting to an airport, and Orange has had skeleton services building back into something more reasonable. I certainly wish all those attending the Bathurst races all the very best. As a motoring enthusiast, I will watch that with great interest, although regrettably I cannot be there.As to the latter part of his question, one of the issues that we will unquestionably have to address is that of services to small regional communities that are struggling to maintain those services. On a bipartisan note, I commend the successive state governments of Queensland that have always been prepared to bend over backwards to support regional aviation for small communities that need them. I recommend that model to other state governments that consistently seek to load all responsibility for everything that happens outside the capital cities, it seems, on to us, particularly New South Wales, where west of the so-called sandstone curtain it is almost impossible to get them to do anything. It really is. Do you know that the New South Wales state government recently trumpeted that they had made a magnificent contribution to regional aviation in Australia: they had abolished $50,000 worth of fees and charges annually across the entire industry. That was painted as though that was supposed to be the salvation of regional aviation.  - In contrast, the Queensland government provides annually $3½ million - $3½ million versus $50,000 -  and, in contrast, we have done things like -  - lowering fuel tax for regional aviation from 17c to 2c, and we have made a very major contribution to regional aviation through what we have done at Sydney airport and access.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question, and I note that since March 1996 unemployment in the city of Parramatta has dropped from over 12 per cent to under three per cent, thanks to the policies of the Howard government and thanks in part to the hard work and the personality of the local member and his strong support for local initiatives.One of the reasons why this government has a good record in jobs growth is that we have grasped the fundamental truth that the worker cannot earn a wage unless the boss can make a profit. Unlike members opposite, we do not think that profit is a dirty word. Unlike members opposite, we do not think that the regulator and the union official are always right. The Leader of the Opposition has taken to running around the country over the last few days talking about job insecurity. According to the Morgan poll, job insecurity reached its height in Australia in November 1992, and guess who was the minister for employment in November 1992? It was none other than the Leader of the Opposition. It is no wonder that people were feeling insecure about their jobs then, because this is what the Leader of the Opposition thought about his job as the minister for employment.  - The Leader of the Opposition told his biographer:I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining ... I thought there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than just about any I have had.This is what he really thought about the employment portfolio. This is what he said to the National Press Club in June 1993:... my father said to me when I got the Defence portfolio that ... I'd been given the poisoned chalice. I thought then he was wrong and now I know he really was wrong. I have it now.He thought that he had the poisoned chalice when he was the minister for employment. He knew when he was the minister for employment that his policies were not working. This is what Neal Blewett, who knew him very well and shared a cabinet table with him, said about the Leader of the Opposition's employment policies:Spurred on by this despair and always inclined to go over the top, Beazley warned that the unemployment figures are going to be pretty horrific, totally horrendous, quite awful over the next 12 months. With so much gloom around, Beazley was in his element. He fears 11 per cent unemployment by the end of the year.Well, he achieved what he feared. This government has a good record at creating jobs. Since March 1996, 882,000 new jobs have been created under this government, and 359,000 of those jobs are full-time jobs. Listen to this: in Labor's last six years there were 405,000 new jobs created, and just 27,000 new full-time jobs were created. Let me say this very sincerely to the Leader of the Opposition: we are proud to run on our jobs record; are you proud to run on yours? - </DOC>

 - I was asked a not dissimilar question, I think, by the member for Fowler yesterday and I said then, and I repeat to the member for Dickson, that while ever this country has any level of unemployment I will not regard the fight against unemployment as having been completed. Whilst I regard the present level of unemployment in Australia as too high, the reality is that it is markedly lower than what it was when this government came to power. - The Leader of the Opposition quite correctly, in the peroration of his valedictory address, expressed the hope that we might have a vigorous and intelligent debate over issues. Let us have an intelligent and vigorous debate over the issue of employment in this country. I said yesterday, and I would repeat it, that if the present level of unemployment represent a jobs crisis, the Leader of the Opposition presided over an employment Armageddon when he was the minister for employment. He would probably regard such a statement by me as a piece of insubstantial rhetoric. I would say that anybody who describes the present level of unemployment in Australia as being a jobs crisis -   - is engaging in that sort of unhelpful rhetoric that does nothing to elevate the quality of political debate in this country - nothing at all. I invite the member for Dickson to acknowledge the fact that, since we have been in government, we have generated almost 900,000 new jobs -  - I remind the member for Dickson that the number of jobs generated over the past 5½ years is almost 900,000. I remind the member for Dickson that the level of unemployment in Australia now is markedly lower than what it was in March 1996 and it is significantly lower than what it was in 1992, when it reached its peak of 11.2 per cent under the old measure, almost 11 per cent under the new measure. I would also remind the member for Dickson that if the party to which she now belongs had not been so obstinate and negative in relation to unfair dismissal laws we would have more jobs in small business than we now have.  - I remind the member for Dickson of the impact of the rejection of that legislation on the small business community of Australia. I would also remember those who sit opposite that if they had not opposed -  -  - I thought somebody would interject about the GST. I have got something to say about the GST, but I will come to that in a moment - I do not want to spoil the point I am making to the member for Dickson about the impact of the Labor Party blocking further deregulation of the labour market. I just make the point that it remains a very interesting observation that, if you look around the world at the moment, the countries that have the lowest level of unemployment are the countries that have a less regulated labour market. - The member for Dickson cannot have it both ways. If you want to have a debate about the causes of unemployment and the impact of economic policy, you have to face up to that reality. The reason why, for example, the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom now is lower than it is in many other European countries is that the Blair government has essentially retained the industrial relations laws of the Thatcher government. - Oh, not true? I see - not true. Well, you ought to go and read The Third Way again and you would understand what it is about.The member for Dickson talked about the retail sector. I am indebted to the member for Dickson for talking about the retail sector and the alleged impact on the retail sector, which was caught up in a question she asked me yesterday about the GST. I have in front of me a quote from an interview this morning with Mr Roger Corbett, the CEO of Woolworths. He knows a bit about employment, he knows a bit about the GST, and he knows a bit about running a successful business. He understands that, if the employer makes a profit, the employer can employ people. Mr Corbett says that the GST has been beneficial for business. He said:It represented a really minor cost movement for Woolworths of only about 0.4 per cent of one per cent, but the really good thing is that a lot of customers had $30, $40 or $50 extra in their pockets to spend. I think that wasn't a retail negative, that was a retail positive for Australia. The strong retail results we enjoyed last year I'm sure were a result of that extra money that many of our customers had.That extra money came courtesy of those who sit behind me. It is those who sit behind me who delivered the $30, $40 or $50 a week into the pockets of Australian consumers. It is those who sit opposite who tried tooth and nail to stop giving that money to the ordinary, battling retail customers of the Australian community. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. I can inform him that after very extensive negotiations the Australian government has renegotiated the double tax agreement between Australia and the United States. Later this afternoon, with the United States Ambassador I will be signing a protocol to that effect. This is an historic breakthrough which will significantly assist trade and investment flows between our two countries. It will be a major step to facilitating a modern and competitive tax treaty network for companies located in Australia. The protocol will reduce dividend withholding tax on dividends paid by US subsidiaries and branches of Australian companies from 15 per cent to zero in most cases, and in some cases to five per cent. This is a significant cut in tax for Australian companies. The US is the largest investment destination for Australian investment abroad, with investment of about $157 billion and, of that, $90 billion was direct equity investment that could qualify to benefit from reduced US taxes in the form of dividend withholding tax. This should also unlock earnings currently retained by Australian branches and subsidiaries in the United States which have not repatriated funds because it would incur dividend withholding tax. Those Australian companies, once the new agreement takes effect, will be able to bring dividends back to Australia without the dividend withholding tax.There are proposed exemptions from withholding tax for interest paid to financial institutions, which will improve Australia's standing as a financial centre and enhance the operation of this sector between the two countries. In addition, Australia will reduce its withholding tax on royalties from 10 to five per cent, which will reduce costs to business for technology and know-how. Australian companies have sought this for a considerable period. It will facilitate Australian companies investing overseas and growing in large US markets, and it will assist their profitability. It has been a very tough negotiation, but it represents a significant step forward. The finalisation of the protocol, which has been keenly awaited by business, will be welcomed by the business communities of both countries.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. The Howard government has a very proud record in lifting standards and expanding access in education in Australia. I am pleased to inform the House today that the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships has now reached the record level of 320,000, which is 2½ times the number in apprenticeships when we came to office. This is excellent news for young Australians, and they are all in real jobs.In schools, Commonwealth funding is a rising proportion of the gross domestic product. Literacy standards have been raised and an increasing number of young people have job opportunities to learn vocational education and career education in schools. In universities, we have record places, record enrolments, record revenues, record international student numbers and, I am pleased to say, record student satisfaction. In research, we are reversing the brain drain and bringing back to Australia some of Australia's most outstanding researchers through Backing Australia's Ability and the Federation Fellowships we have announced.I have been asked about any alternatives. On the other side of the chamber, we see complete disorganisation and contradiction in education policy. We see the Leader of the Opposition saying that he supports grants to Catholic schools while at the same time he is denying funding to four Catholic primary schools: St Angela's Primary School, Lumen Christi Catholic College, St Andrew's Catholic College and Jubilee Primary School. We heard the member for Dobell, the SS Minnow over there in the bathtub armada behind the Leader of the Opposition, say in the House this morning, `Our highest priority' - if you can believe this - `is the needy schools throughout Australia.' He said that this morning and yet his party is denying funding to 54 needy schools. This is the kind of shadow world described by the Treasurer, this world of half-light, half-truths and contradictions that pervades the opposition at the present time.Where is the person who is supposed to be giving security and certainty to the opposition's policy stances - the man who is going to give certainty and security to Australia, the commander of the bathtub fleet, the commander of the SS Jawbone -   -  - The SS Backbone sank sometime ago, I think. The Leader of the Opposition, this purported national leader, had a secret weapon in education - Opposition members - You! - We remember noodle nation. Remember what he said about noodle nation. On 12 July, just before the Aston by-election, at a doorstop in Wantirna, the Leader of the Opposition said:Frankly, if I can't get it across, I'm not worth anything, anyway.And we have not heard it mentioned in the House since. If he cannot give any certainty to his own policy, he certainly cannot give any certainty to Australia.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the question reveals the fantasy world in which the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow minister for education live in relation to education, because the reality is that no federal government has -  - This government has made a massive investment in schooling in Australia, in public schooling and in non-government schooling. Schooling expenditures are one of the fastest rising areas of the federal budget. Schooling expenditure from the Commonwealth -  - Schooling expenditures are a rising proportion of GDP from the Commonwealth, and it is a great shame, from the point of view of many public schools in Australia, that Labor state governments are at the same time draining funding out of those school systems. We can see that very clearly in New South Wales and in Victoria, where Commonwealth funding is rising much more rapidly than state funding. In the higher education area, there is now a record number of students at Australian universities. The government has recently announced additional funding for fully-funded places at Australian universities that will create something like 20,000 more places over the next five years, through Backing Australia's Ability and the regional places announced in this year's budget. The postgraduate loans scheme will provide, we estimate, an additional 30,000 places over the next five years. That is the equivalent of two new universities, yet we have the opposition living in a fantasy world that as if, somehow or other, places are actually falling. This government is investing massively in education and is opening up educational opportunities. The Labor Party alone is cutting funding to schools at the present time. Their only announced policies are to cut funding to a community school on the Darling Downs, which is going to lose some $3,000 per student as a result of the education policies of the Labor Party. - As a result of the education policies of the Labor Party, some 54 low fee, Catholic parish and community schools, including an Aboriginal community school in the Kimberley, are going to have their funding slashed so the Leader of the Opposition can make some kind of pact with the Australian Education Union and the extremist officials who lead it. This is it at the expense of these schools, many of which are relying on this funding. These schools have every entitlement to have their funding. Let me read the comment from the principal of St Stephen's College in the electorate of Hinkler. Because of the Labor Party's actions the school will not be receiving the $15,250 next week they were expecting. This is what the principal, Mr Peter Fowler, had to say -  - The question was about school funding, and this is a very important aspect of school funding policy. - The Principal of St Stephen's College, in the electorate of Hinkler, had this to say:Parents of our students worked their hearts out on the factory floor so they can have a choice of education for their children. Every dollar is needed in a growing school. We are a beginning school trying to establish itself. We are not a rich school. Blocking this funding would be denying the rights of rural and regional students and will mean their education is put at risk or undermined.When we go to the election, whenever it may be, the Labor Party will be taking to the Australian people a policy to cut funding to needy schools in Australia, with 50 schools already having had their funding cut and many more threatened with cuts in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. He - like the member for Deakin, the member for Pearce, the member for Aston and other members for outer eastern Melbourne suburbs - has undoubtedly been positive and passionate but also very persistent in his pursuit of Commonwealth support for the Scoresby Freeway. - I take it that the question refers to events since 13 May, when the Prime Minister - down there on the map, so to speak - committed the Commonwealth government to $220 million up-front towards the freeway, including over $25 million this year, and at the same time made it plain that the Commonwealth will pick up 50 per cent of contributions to the construction of the freeway. At the same time that this was to be done under the Roads of National Importance program - a Liberal-National government initiative, one that did not exist in the days of the Keating and Beazley governments - we sought a 50 per cent contribution from the Victorian government. What have we seen since then? All we have seen is smoke and mirrors. We are yet to see the Victorian government commit a red cent to this project. Indeed, despite that, the Bracks government have had the audacity to go out and demand that we fund this road fifty-fifty with them. As the Treasurer alludes to frequently when I talk to him, they have not committed a cent anywhere in their budget documentation. It is not there. As I understand it, there is $2 million there in planning for the light rail - but none for the roads.We have committed $220 million, compared with the Victorian government's contribution of nothing. Mr Bracks's next step was to sign a piece of cardboard - a declaration of commitment, a hollow document with no binding effect at all - which prompted the Herald Sun to say recently:Premier Steve Bracks should get on with building the needed Scoresby Freeway and quit trying to turn the issue into a political stunt.The article continued:By signing a declaration of intent with 10 local mayors this week, promising to provide half of the $1.3 billion needed for the project, he made only a hollow gesture towards the region's troubled road users.That is what the article had to say. I was a bit interested in the declarations, and I went in pursuit of them. The Prime Minister will be particularly interested in these, because the first version of the declaration is called `The Scoresby Transport Corridor and Mayoral Call for Commitment'. They wanted all the local mayors - 10 of them - to sign up. I should not imagine that would be too difficult to get. Over and above that, the declaration of commitment called for both parties -  federal and state governments - to explore all avenues to find the money.They provided signature blocks for the Premier of Victoria, the Victorian roads minister, the Prime Minister, me, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman, the alternative minister for roads. They then produced a second document, which was signed by the Premier of Victoria and the state minister for transport. It had only two other signature blocks: one for the Prime Minister and one for me. They left off the signature blocks for the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman. They were not there. That prompts me to ask these questions: have they left off the signature blocks for the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman because they will not commit to the Scoresby Freeway? Is that the reason? Or is it possible that there is another reason - that the Bracks government does not believe it is relevant to seek their support for the road anyway, on the basis that they no longer believe that they are likely to have to deal with them?This is an absurd situation. The state government in Victoria are demanding that we fund 50 per cent of the road, when in reality we are the only ones who have put 50 per cent of the money on the table for the road. The Victorian government have not put anything on it. - Matching the Victorian government's demand would involve a nil contribution from us - matching nothing is nothing. More than that, they insist that we match it but do not believe it is relevant or appropriate to demand that the Leader of the Opposition or the alternative transport minister sign it. I simply conclude by saying this for the benefit of the Victorian government and the opposition: the Commonwealth has $220 million on the table and a commitment to build the road on a cost sharing basis as a road of national importance. The ALP in Victoria, true to form, have made no such commitment. All they have done is to issue a lot of hollow rhetoric. Interestingly, they do not believe that it is necessary to involve the federal opposition in any way, shape or form. </DOC>
