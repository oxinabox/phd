                          Madam Speaker, if standing order 99 is to mean anything at all, this question has to be in order.
     I will just take you through it briefly.
     Standing order 99 allows questions without notice to any member relating to the business of a committee for which the member asked is responsible.
     I would point out: the member for Holt is the chair of the relevant committee.
     A question to a committee chair asking when a report will be tabled has been permitted.
     But that is not the case on this occasion.
     A question asking if a committee had been requested to inquire into a certain matter has not been permitted.
     That is not the case on this occasion.
     The Speaker has ruled out of order a question to a chair which asks that the committee examine certain matters.
     We are not asking that on this occasion.
     Questions concerning statements by a committee chair are not permitted.
     We are not asking about the statements that the member for Holt made in the tabling of his report; we are asking him if he still believes, in the light of his committee's report, which he was responsible for, that our security agencies' capacity to perform their tasks -                       Madam Speaker, I would point out that the member for Holt is enthusiastically wishing to answer the question.
     He wishes to do so.
     I would also point out that opportunities to ask questions about committee business are restricted by standing order 100(e) which prevents questions referring to:         _ proceedings of a committee not reported to the House.
             In this case, the committee has reported.
     The member for Holt is the chair.
     It does not contravene any of the rules in the standing orders.
     And, if he is not able to answer this question, standing order 99 might as well be removed from the standing orders.
                          I didn't use the term 'view', you stupid person.
                          I withdraw, Madam Speaker, but I point out -                       it was a completely false statement.
                          Thank you, Madam Speaker.
     My question is to the member for Holt, under standing order 99.
     I remind the member for Holt that, as chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, he recently tabled the report,Review of administration and expenditure No.

     In light of his committee's report, does he confirm that the committee found that our security agencies' capacity to perform their tasks had been sequestered from the necessary funding to execute their role adequately, and does he agree with the findings?

    ' Given that the government posted a deficit of $19.
    4 billion this year and is projected to deliver $29 billion of further deficits, is that not a powerful confirmation of the failure of the government's policies?

     Minister, every year Australian governments spend a fortune leasing foreign firefighting aircraft like the acclaimed Erickson Air-Crane.
     Why don't we establish our own firefighting air force of large specialised aircraft?
     The Defence Force, for instance, operates hundreds of aircraft, many of which never see operational service.
     Imagine the good that a dozen or so large specialised firefighting aircraft would do.
     They could even be profitable by helping other countries in the northern summer.
                          My apologies, Madam Speaker.
     I did say, 'the minister responsible'.
