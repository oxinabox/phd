As at 1 June 2010, 91,061 permanent skilled migration visa applications were awaiting processing, including 4051 in the Business Skills category. This figure represents principal applicants.Of these applications, 46,864 are sponsored and 44,197 independent.No.and (b) Due to the current Priority Processing Direction which requires permanent Employer Sponsored and certain General Skilled Migration (GSM) visa applications to be processed in a particular order of priority it is not possible to provide a definitive average processing time. Furthermore, processing times vary across visa subclasses and also within subclasses due to factors such as onshore/offshore lodgement, whether a security referral is required and the completeness of the application provided to my Department at time of lodgement.However, in general, a permanent GSM application lodged with the Department onshore will be processed within two to three months of allocation to a case officer. In cases where the application is for an offshore applicant, processing times are between three to four months. Should a security referral be required, processing may take 12 to 18 months from the time of allocation. The above applies to both sponsored and independent visa applications.It should be noted that GSM applications are not automatically allocated upon receipt by the Department. It can take between 12 to 24 months (or more) for an application to be allocated to a case officer due to the existing pipeline and priority processing arrangements. Processing does not commence until allocation.Employer sponsored visa applications (Employer Nomination Scheme and Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme) take on average, three to six months to be processed.As with the GSM and employer sponsored visa categories, processing times for the remaining permanent skilled migration visas varies due to a number of factors including onshore or offshore lodgement and security referral.Business Skills visas on average, take approximately six to twelve months and Distinguish Talent visas six to eight months.</DOC>

On 27 April 2010, the Indonesian Government introduced an Immigration Bill to Parliament, which contains provisions aimed at criminalising people smuggling. Introduction of the Immigration Bill follows President Yudhoyono's announcement, in March 2010, that Indonesia would move to criminalise people smuggling. In accordance with the Indonesian parliamentary process, following its introduction to Parliament the Immigration Bill was submitted to the Legal Affairs and Human Rights Commission of Parliament (known as 'Commission III'), where it will be the subject of debate and possibly amendment by members of the Commission.to (d) It would not be appropriate for the Australian Government to comment on the content of Indonesia's Immigration Bill. The Bill is still subject to debate and possible amendment by the Indonesian Parliament.</DOC>

Family members of persons who have been granted permanent Protection visas or Resolution of Status visas in Australia can be proposed for entry under the split family provisions of the Humanitarian Program or sponsored for entry under the Family Stream of the Migration Program.Under the split family provisions of the Humanitarian Program, a person granted a permanent humanitarian visa (including Permanent Protection or Resolution of Status) has five years from the date of grant to propose their immediate family members.  For this purpose, 'immediate family member' refers to a spouse, dependent child or, where the family member in Australia is under 18 years of age, a parent.Data is not kept in a way that can be interrogated to answer the question asked. I can, however, advise that under the Humanitarian Program, in the period 1 December 2007 to 30 June 2010, 1612 applications (4133 persons) were received from family members who held Protection visas or Resolution of Status visas. Of that same cohort, 589 applications (1598 persons) were granted, 145 applications (378 persons) were withdrawn or refused and 878 applications (2157 persons) are yet to be finalised as at 30 September 2010 (Source: MPMS 30 September 2010 extract).</DOC>

Consular officials have attended all of Mr Palfreeman's court appearances, most recently on 21 October 2010, and will continue to do so. Consular officials have spoken to Mr Palfreeman's lawyer on a regular basis.Consular officials provided Mr Palfreeman with a list of local lawyers upon his arrest in 2008 and have visited him regularly in detention. During a visit to Australia in October 2009, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Smith raised Mr Palfreeman's case with his Bulgarian counterpart, Deputy Foreign Minister Raykov. I also raised Mr Palfreeman's case myself with President Parvanov during his visit. On 9 November 2009, Australia's Ambassador to Bulgaria (resident in Athens, Greece) raised the case with Mr Raykov. On 9 March 2010, the Australian Embassy in Athens made formal enquiries of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, seeking clarification of the conditions of Mr Palfreeman's detention.Consular officials have visited Mr Palfreeman in gaol regularly, most recently on 22 October 2010, and will continue to do so while he remains in detention. Consular officials in Athens and Canberra have met with Mr Palfreeman's family on a regular basis.</DOC>

The people listed in the question were those listed in a provisional (draft) list compiled by and circulated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat and it reflected information submitted in advance of the 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) meeting. The draft list of COP15 participants circulated by the UNFCCC contained some errors and also included people who did not attend the Copenhagen conference. This list, although released by the UNFCCC, does not represent the Official Australian Delegation to COP15.The Official Australian Delegation to COP15 comprised 98 people, including 30 observers from State and Territory Governments and non-government organisations. The name, title and agency for each member of the Official Australian Delegation is provided at Attachment A. The names of Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers providing protection to the Prime Minister have not been provided. The AFP does not comment on security or issues that may disclose methodology associated with security matters.A final list of participants to COP15 was published by the UNFCCC Secretariat following COP15, although it still contains some inaccuracies.Please refer to Attachment A for the name, title and agency for each member of the Official Australian Delegation. Sourcing information on the length of time that those listed above had been employed in their position would be an unreasonable diversion of Government resources as it would require approaching each member of the Official Australian Delegation to seek their permission for the release of that personal information, in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988. The Minister would also only be able to provide information on officers from the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (the Department)  -  for all non-Departmental officers the Member will need to approach the relevant Minister or agency.Please refer to the response to part (1).It would be an unreasonable diversion of Government resources to prepare an overview of the specific area of expertise or professional responsibilities, the role that each individual played in the Official Australian Delegation, and how they were selected.The objectives for the delegation at the Conference were discussed by the Australian Government at Cabinet-level in advance of the COP15 Conference and are confidential.It would be an unreasonable diversion of Government resources to prepare an overview of the scheduled appointments or meetings for each member of the Australian delegation to the Conference.Formal meetings commenced in Copenhagen on 7 December 2009 and concluded on the afternoon of 19 December 2009. Daily programs for the formal COP15 meetings are available on the UNFCCC website. No formal UNFCCC meetings were scheduled on 13 December 2009. However, informal negotiations commenced before 7 December 2009, were ongoing through 13 December 2009 and through to the conclusion of the conference.It would be an unreasonable diversion of Government resources to prepare an overview of each meeting or briefing involving the then Minister or the then Prime Minister on any occasion at the Conference. Further, informal or confidential discussions by any member of the Australian Official Delegation are not recorded.The UNFCCC has published the formal report of the Conference on its website. In line with established practice, individual delegates from the Department did not write up reports of their individual activities during the Conference. For all non-Departmental officers the member will need to approach the relevant Minister or agency.

The Government's primary support for the deployment of renewable energy in Australia is the expanded 20 per cent by 2020 Renewable Energy Target (RET), and as such the Government is not considering introducing a national feed-in tariff for renewable energy.The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has previously considered this issue.  In November 2008, COAG agreed and announced four National Principles to be applied to jurisdictional feed-in tariff schemes.  The National Principles were intended to be a guide for the state and territory governments considering introducing a feed-in tariff scheme, or reviewing existing schemes.Premium feed-in tariffs create an additional burden on electricity consumers, particularly those that cannot afford to install renewable energy systems but pay higher electricity prices to cross-subsidise those that can afford such systems.Maintaining the least cost approach to stimulating investment in renewable generation that is represented by the RET will minimise the impact on electricity prices and vulnerable Australian electricity consumers.</DOC>

Framework for Measuring Performance Benchmarks under the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health (NPAPH) was agreed to at the 12 November 2010 Australian Health Ministers' Conference. This Framework outlines the approach for using available and planned survey data to report against the seven performance benchmarks contained with the NPAPH.The Enabling Infrastructure (Surveillance) Initiative under the NPAPH will provide $10 million to states and territories to implement or expand existing surveillance capacity to support the monitoring and reporting requirements specified in the Framework.Data to establish benchmark baselines will be requested from jurisdictions and determined in early 2011.</DOC>

to (c) The annual Gap Year intake has been re-shaped to reflect Defence's ability to provide a quality Gap Year experience, and the training capacity available within the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The changes reflect recent strong recruitment and retention in the permanent elements of the three Services.The large Navy intake to date has begun to affect the training and on-the-job experience available for both its Gap Year and permanent members. Consequently from 2011, Navy's intake will be 100 per year (down from 267). Army's intake will remain at 317. Air Force has found that conducting the Gap Year risks bringing in more people than can be accommodated and impacts on core training for permanent Air Force members. Consequently, Air Force's intake of 116 will be suspended in 2011.No places will be specifically reserved for female applicants. However, the Gap Year has proved very popular with young women, who have consistently been strongly represented in the program. As at 1 October 2010, 30 per cent of Gap Year participants were female  -  more than double the female representation in the ADF overall. By Service as at 1 October 2010, the Gap year consisted of 44 per cent female for Navy, 18 per cent for Army and 35 per cent for Air Force.</DOC>

I am advised that issues in relation to registration and 'spamming' have been raised with the Tax Practitioners Board (TPB) on a small number of occasions and the Board will determine if any further action is required.The TPB is required to establish and maintain a register of tax and BAS agents on the internet which includes the name of the registered tax or BAS agent and their contact details. An agent's details may appear on the online register before they receive a letter of acknowledgement because the issuing of letters is a manual process whereas the updating of the information on the online register is automated. The TPB is addressing this issue and these changes are due to occur in the first quarter of 2011. Such changes will include automated emails being sent to agents at the same time as their details are placed on the Register and limiting contact detail information to business addresses, rather than emails.</DOC>

On 2 November 2010, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE) wrote the Senate Standing Committee Secretary to correct Hansard.The correct answer is that there are eight Regional Broadband Coordinators in total providing public information on the National Broadband Network. The fourteen officers relate to other local activities supporting digital switchover. The Digital Switchover Taskforce provides funding to local organisations to employ Digital Switchover Liaison Officers and by the end of 2010, it is expected that fourteen will have been employed.To support the implementation of the Regional Backbone Blackspots Program, the Department has appointed eight Regional Broadband Coordinators to promote of broadband and raise awareness of the Regional Backbone Blackspots Program and broadband initiatives in blackspot route locations of South West Gippsland, Geraldton, Victor Harbor, Darwin, Emerald to Longreach/Mt Isa, Toowoomba to Arcadia, Gawler to Renmark and Shepparton to Mildura/Broken Hill.The recruitment process was undertaken in accordance with the principles and processes used for the appointment of non ongoing APS employees. A specific selection process strategy was prepared based on the department's Non-SES Recruitment Policy and Guide.The eight positions were publicly advertised in 28 relevant state, regional and local newspapers, in seek.com and in www.apsjobs.gov.auApplications were assessed through a competitive, merit-based and transparent selection process. Assessment was against the selection criteria and only those that met the criteria to the highest degree were shortlisted for telephone interviews. This was followed by face-to-face interviews for those who ranked highly at the telephone interviews.Two selection panels were established to facilitate the selection of candidates. Each panel comprised senior departmental employees and a local external representative for each region (senior officials from relevant Regional Development Australia offices).All shortlisted candidates were asked to declare any potential or perceived conflict of interest at both telephone and face-to-face interviews. Following the interviews, referee reports were sought to verify the candidates' claims.Following completion of the process, offers of employment were made to six successful candidates. Two positions were unable to be filled through this process and were subsequently filled through the secondment of existing Australian Public Service employees.Additional InformationAll appointments were subject to police checks, obtaining a protected level security clearance, satisfying a health assessment and confirming they possessed a current driver's licence.Coordinators are engaged as non-ongoing staff employed by the department in accordance with the public service regulations for a specified term for non-ongoing employment.Based on information submitted by the coordinators to the department, no Regional Broadband Coordinator was previously employed by a union or in the personal office of a Australian Labor Party politician.</DOC>

Between 1957 to 1978.No.Bone samples were obtained from a number of hospitals and coronial institutions in mainland capital cities around Australia. Bone samples were removed from approximately 22,000 bodies. In all cases where there was remaining ash residue that could be identified, the residue was returned to the appropriate institution in each state (relevant hospital or state health department). It was anticipated that state authorities would make those residues available to the families upon request. All unidentifiable ashed remains were interred in the grounds of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency's Yallambie laboratories in a ceremony in May 2007.</DOC>

The Australian Government, announced the locations of ten new headspace sites on 24 July 2010. The selection of the location of these sites was based on criteria agreed by the headspace Board, in consultation with the Australian Government. These criteria are as follows:Priority will be given to areas that:have a significant, and possibly growing youth population, the needs of whom are not currently being met through existing headspace services;experience known socio-economic disadvantage and/or have a high Indigenous youth population;have experienced indicators of social distress in relation to youth mental health eg. incidence of youth suicide, imprisonment, or homelessness;have sufficient local capacity and infrastructure to support integration and possibly co-location of headspace's four streams of support  -  physical health, mental health, alcohol and other drugs, and social/vocational support; andwill be supported by existing local service providers and community organisations.The location of future headspace sites will be determined by headspace and the Commonwealth, having regard to the criteria set out in response (1) above.Of the existing 30 headspace sites, four are located in Queensland - Fraser Coast (Maryborough), Gold Coast (Southport), Southern Downs (Warwick), Townsville (Thuringowa) - with an additional three Queensland sites announced in July 2010 at Brisbane South (Inala), Brisbane North (Nundah), and Cairns. Locations of future sites will be determined through the process outlined in response (2) above.</DOC>

The department is leasing the facility at Leonora. Between 27 April 2010 and 7 November 2010, the department has paid $3.1m in leasing fees to the property's owner for the use of the facility. The overall cost will depend on the size and composition of the client and staff population and the duration for which the facility is used.Refurbishments works were undertaken by the owner and are only minor in nature.The duration of the lease is six months. There is an option to renew this twice on a six month leasing arrangement. The first option has now been exercised.The operator of the facility will primarily source goods from local and regional suppliers.The facility utilises static guarding in conjunction with the interactive management model utilised throughout the detention network as the primary security measure.A new fence will be constructed around the site by the owner. The department has agreed to share the cost of construction, which has been estimated at a total of $93,000.</DOC>

While I have visited many of Australia's 756 public hospitals, I have not had the opportunity to visit Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital.The Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) did not receive a submission from the NSW Government, or any other entity, for funding for the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital under the Health and Hospitals Fund.The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare regularly receives information on public hospitals, some of which is now published on the MyHospitals website.Under the Private Health Insurance Act 2007, all hospitals (both public and private), as part of the Commonwealth declaration process for private health insurance benefits, the Medicare Benefits Scheme and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, where applicable, must have and maintain accreditation from an appropriate accreditation agency. The responsibility of the Department is to ensure that hospitals maintain their level of accreditation.Under the National Health and Hospitals Network Agreement, a new National Performance Authority is being established to report on individual hospitals, both public and private, Local Hospital Networks, and Medicare Locals. The Authority will publish Hospital Performance Reports that will provide clear and nationally comparable performance data covering every Local Hospital Network, the hospitals within it and on the performance of private hospitals.No. See answer to (3) above.</DOC>

Cosmetic surgery is defined as any medical or dental procedure undertaken solely for the purpose of attempting to preserve or improve a person's subjective appearance.  It is one type of plastic surgery.  Procedures conducted for the sole purpose of improving or preserving the subjective appearance of a member (i.e. cosmetic surgery) are not provided at public expense.No cosmetic procedures have been undertaken since 1 December 2007.  There have been 60 surgical procedures provided to ADF members since 1 December 2007 that would be considered as 'plastic surgery'.Specific plastic surgery procedures provided include breast and other post-cancer-related reconstructions, breast reduction and a small number of breast augmentation procedures.  All have had an identified, justifiable and well documented clinical need and have been managed in accordance with extant Defence policy, and therefore are not regarded as cosmetic.  No gender change surgery has been provided at public expense.No funding has been provided for cosmetic procedures since 1 December 2007.  The total cost of all plastic surgery procedures provided since 1 December 2007 is estimated at $633,000.</DOC>

Expenditure for the PIP Practice Nurse Incentive is demand driven. In 2009-10, funding of around $55.3 million was provided to 2,504 practices to support them to employ practice nurses. Data on the number of nurses employed by these practices is not collected.In 2009-10, expenditure on the Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) practice nurse items (items 10986-87, 10993-99) was approximately $88 million.The first two MBS practice nurse items (items 10993 and 10996) were introduced on 1 February 2004. The other items have subsequently been added, most recently in 2007-08. The following table shows the total services for MBS practice nurse items (items 10986-87 and 10993-99) on the Medicare Benefits Schedule since 1 February 2004 are:Financial YearTotal Services*2003/20041,136,2002004/20052,691,6582005/20063,211,6212006/20073,659,6672007/20085,218,2552008/20095,461,7582009/20107,621,039               * MBS items 10986-87 and 10993-99(MBS items 10986, 10987 and 10997 may be provided by a Practice Nurse or a registered Aboriginal Health Worker).* MBS items 10986-87 and 10993-99(MBS items 10986, 10987 and 10997 may be provided by a Practice Nurse or a registered Aboriginal Health Worker).The National Primary Health Care Strategy was informed by extensive health reform consultations undertaken by the Department including submissions received through the consultation process. A number of submissions commented on how the current funding arrangements impact on practice nurses' ability to operate at their full capacity and the task oriented and limited 'for and on behalf of' funding of the MBS practice nurse items.The incentive cap of five per practice acknowledges that most practices currently have five or fewer full time equivalent GPs.See response to (3)(a).See response to (3)(a).A review of the PIP Practice Nurse Incentive was undertaken in 2005 as part of the budget process. The findings of this review have not been made public.It is estimated that the Practice Nurse Incentive Program will support approximately 4,600 full time practice nurse positions. The 4,600 full time practice nurse positions include replacement funding for the current PIP Practice Nurse Incentive payments (836 FTE), and providing incentives for the equivalent of an estimated 3,757 FTE practice nurses in practices that do not currently receive an incentive. This is in line with the primary focus of the initiative, which is to strengthen and support the role of existing practice nurses. The AGPN National Practice Nurse Workforce Survey Report in 2009 indicates that 84.8% of practice nurses are Registered Nurses and 15.2% are Enrolled Nurses.How many treatments administered by practice nurses will the 2010 Budget measure fund.The Practice Nurse Incentive Program will not fund individual treatments. Instead, it will enable practices to expand the scope of their practice nurses and utilise nurses to best meet the needs of patients. This will include continuing to provide services such as immunization, wound management and cervical smears.The Department undertook extensive modelling for this Budget measure. As with all Budget measures the modelling is not publicly available.</DOC>

The Australian Government has established NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) to build and operate the National Broadband Network (NBN). The government originally estimated that NBN Co would invest up to $43 billion over eight years to fund the rollout and ongoing operations of the network.On 20 December 2010 the government released NBN Co's Corporate Plan to the public which indicated that the total capital expenditure for the project is estimated to be $35.9 billion, less than the government's original $43 billion dollar estimate, in large part due to the agreement between NBN Co and Telstra. The government expects to contribute $27.5 billion in equity for the rollout.The government is still committed to private sector investment in the NBN following completion of the network and subject to examination of the Productivity Commission Inquiry report by a joint committee of Parliament.</DOC>

The Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 ('the Act') provides for a Universal Service Obligation (USO) to ensure that standard telephone services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business (section 9(1)(a)). The obligation includes the supply of a standard telephone service on request (section 9(2)).The Act does not specify a type of technology that must be used to deliver USO voice telephony. Telstra, as the primary universal service provider, provides standard telephone services through a range of customer access networks, such as optical fibre, coaxial cable, copper wire pairs, radio and satellite in fulfilment of the USO (Item 2.2 of Telstra's USO Standard Marketing Plan).</DOC>

Why did a Reserve Company not get deployed to Butterworth? The most recent Australian Army rotation to Rifle Company Butterworth, was rotation 92, comprising of members from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment from within the 3rd Brigade based in Townsville. The deployment of an element of the 1st Battalion was an integral component in their training schedule in accordance with Army's force generation cycle.Why did the Government not instead call for a High Readiness Reserve Company to be sent?The Government can not 'call for' a HRR company. Only the Service Chiefs (in this case CA/CDF) can 'call for' a particular unit/member to volunteer for service. A 'call out' is a lawful order made by the Governor-General for a member or members to undertake continuous full time service in accordance with Section 50D of the Defence Act. It is limited to specific circumstances:war or warlike operation;defence emergency;defence preparation;peacekeeping or peace enforcement, assistance to Commonwealth, State, Territory or foreign government authorities and agencies in matters involving Australia's national security or affecting Australian defence interest;support to community activities of national or international significance, andcivil aid, humanitarian assistance, medical or civil emergency or disaster relief.Consequently, a rotation to Rifle Company Butterworth does not fall within 'call out' circumstances. As at 26 November 2010, the current posted strength of each High Readiness Reserve Company was as follows:4th Brigade  -  1505th Brigade  -  1678th Brigade - 1639th Brigade - 15111th Brigade - 13813th Brigade  -  132and (5) The Army Reserve Approved Future Force was the title given to a draft working document developed by Army, dealing with the Reserve specific component of the whole of Army review, titled 'Rebalancing Army'. As a result of a range of matters, most importantly lessons learned from ongoing operations, Army is continuing a holistic review of the structure of Army's Total Force in 2011 and will draw on lessons learned from Rebalancing Army. A final implementation plan is due in late 2011.The White Paper states that Army's 'implementation plan will contain options for (among other considerations) how part-time force elements might act as a 'repository' of some high end, longer lead time capabilities for contingencies related to the defence of Australia, as a hedge against strategic risk, and an expansion base should we require it'. The current Army Review will address these matters.</DOC>

The Government is not creating any statutory monopolies for NBN Co. It is simply acknowledging the reality that, in the residential and small business markets, the fixed line access network by its nature has monopoly characteristics. As such NBN Co's network is likely, in a practical sense, to be a monopoly in these markets just as Telstra's copper network has been. In recognition that NBN Co's access network will have monopoly characteristics, the NBN will be wholesale-only and provide open and non-discriminatory access subject to close Australian Competition and Consumer Commission scrutiny. These arrangements are detailed in the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010 and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures - Access Arrangements) Bill 2010, introduced into the House of Representatives on 25 November 2010.</DOC>

The location of the 36 GP Super Clinics, including information on their electorate is referred to in the table attached.Note that the 36 sites were selected against the following principles, rather than the three criteria identified in this question:Poor access to health services;Poor health infrastructure;Where a GP Super Clinic could help take pressure off emergency departments;High levels of chronic disease and/or populations with high needs, such as large numbers of children or the elderly; andAreas currently experiencing, or anticipated to experience, rapid population growth.Please refer to the table attached for responses against each site, as per the criteria listed above.Data obtained from:http://www.doctorconnect.gov.au/internet/otd/Publishing.nsf/Content/locator (at time of location announcement);http://www.publichealth.gov.au; andThe socioeconomic indexes for areas (SEIFA) score as per the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006 Census data.(3)   Please refer to the table attached.(4)   (a)   The original 31 locations to receive a GP Super Clinic were announced (from late August to late November 2007) as 2007 election commitments. The Government announced a further five locations in late 2009 (Cockburn WA, Gunnedah NSW, Portland, Wodonga and South Morang VIC).Dates for the announcement of Funding Agreements to establish the individual clinics are identified in the table below.(b)   (c) In a number of instances (e.g. Modbury and Noarlunga, SA and Ipswich and Brisbane Southside, QLD), the capital works projects for a GP Super Clinic involves separate stages/phases of construction. Upon completion of a stage/phase of construction, it is expected that a GP Super Clinic will commence service delivery and therefore become operational. Where a GP Super Clinic has a staged or phased implementation, all stages/phases are required to be completed before the project is deemed to have achieved 'Practical Completion' under the terms of the Funding Agreement. Refer to the table attached for further details.Some funding recipients have decided to offer services prior to the commencement of construction of their GP Super Clinic or while construction is underway. These clinics are deemed to be delivering 'early services', rather than being deemed 'operational', as the construction project has not been completed. Early services are being delivered at ten sites: Blue Mountains, North Central Coast, Riverina (NSW); Bendigo and Wodonga (VIC); Townsville, Cairns and Gladstone (QLD); and Modbury and Noarlunga (SA).(d)   The Department does not collect this information.(5)   (a)   Information regarding patient service numbers is confidential under the secrecy provisions (Section 130) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, as it would provide activity and billing information for individual medical practices. As the Australian Government does not own or operate GP Super Clinics, recruitment and engagement of service providers is the responsibility of the owner/operator of each clinic. (b) The number of GPs and nurses are indicated in the answers to Question 6 below. The Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) does not keep data on the number of allied health professionals, rather the range of allied services provided that address the needs of the local communication are monitored, also outlined in Question 6 below.(6)   The eight operational GP Super Clinics have advised that they offer the following services:

The initial interview which is called the entry interview is conducted by departmental officers and is primarily intended to confirm biodata provided by irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs) and ascertain whether the individual IMA, prima facie, engages Australia's protection obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (The Refugee Convention).    The entry interview is also used to collect information to ascertain their personal history, establish how and why they came to Australia, the travel routes taken to arrive in Australia and the reasons for coming to Australia. Yes, the entry interview includes questions about the interviewee's previous country or countries of residence, in addition to their country of birth/origin.The information held by the department does not specifically relate to the time frames in the question.  However, we can advise that approximately 45% of the IMAs who arrived in Australia from 1 August 2008 to 19 August 2010 indicated that their last country of long-term residence was outside their country of birth, or that they had spent more than three months in a single transit point en route to Australia.  Data analysis has not yet been completed for IMA clients who arrived in Australia after 19 August 2010.The country of birth of IMAs described in part (3) is as follows:Afghanistan75.3%Iraq9.8%Sri Lanka6.6%Burma3.4%Iran2.1%Kuwait1.4%Pakistan0.4%Vietnam0.3%Unknown*0.2%Bangladesh0.1%Somalia0.1%Syria0.1%Turkey  0.1%United Arab Emirates0.1%       *Note: 'Unknown' indicates insufficient information provided by the client at entry interview.*Note: 'Unknown' indicates insufficient information provided by the client at entry interview.*Note: 'Unknown' indicates insufficient information provided by the client at entry interview.       The length of time IMAs described in part (3) spent in the above countries is as follows:3 - 6 months8.5%6 - 9 months2.3%9 - 12 months0.8%1 year or more88.4%
 The above tables are created from data extracted from entry interviews.  This data is collected at an early stage in the IMA process, is subject to further change by the client and therefore the credibility of the information cannot be confirmed in all cases. </DOC>

Since the previous Minister's announcement on 18 April 2010 that RAAF Base Curtin would be used to accommodate Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs), the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has commenced a staged refurbishment and upgrade program at the site.The first stage was completed on 11 June 2010 to ensure the site's suitability for the accommodation of single adult male IMAs.  This provided accommodation, covered walkways, raised decking, recreation marquees, communications, a kitchen upgrade, gym equipment, a mini soccer field and primary medical facilities.By mid-November 2010, accommodation for a further 300 people became available.  Other works completed by that time include development of a concept master plan and the installation of demountable buildings for gymnasiums, recreation rooms and religious rooms. Work to bring the accommodation capacity of Curtin to 1200 people was completed in late December 2010.  Other ongoing work includes construction of a commercial kitchen, library, classrooms, canteen, visitor centre, a sports ground, administration areas and additional medical and interview rooms.  Upgrades to the power, water and sewer systems are also underway.As at 30 September 2010, the Department had paid or accrued invoices totalling $20.2 million. 1200 single adult males.The funding allocation for infrastructure and upgrade works to the facilities at the Curtin Detention Centre is $137.2 million.On 24 June 2010, and in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the Government obtained Parliamentary approval for the work at Curtin to proceed, without referral to the Public Works Committee.</DOC>

The Department also works with clients to locate documentation which is relevant to establishing their identity.The Department's approach to age determination is informed by the approach taken in the refugee assessment context internationally.  Because of the challenging nature of age determination, the Department is developing enhanced policy in this area and in that context providing more robust guidance for Departmental decision makers.  The Department is always looking for ways to strengthen policies and technologies in this area to support decision makers.The Department does not keep separate statistics on the number of cases where age determination processes have been undertaken, as establishing age is just one aspect of identity checking that the Department undertakes in relation to undocumented clients. The issue of age determination is often complex, with many clients who arrive as Irregular Maritime Arrivals presenting with no proof of identity and often not being able to provide a date or even a year of birth.  The Department's approach to age determination is to seek to establish whether it is more likely that a client is over or under 18 years of age, taking into account a range of information, rather than seeking to attribute a particular age to the client.    As noted above, the Department does not keep separate statistics on the number of cases where age determination processes have been undertaken, as this is just one aspect of establishing identity.  The Department can confirm that there have been some cases where, following examination of age-related claims, clients claiming to be minors have been assessed to be adults.  In such cases, clients are provided with an opportunity to comment on this finding and to provide further information in support of their age-related claims.  The Department will treat a person claiming to be a minor as an adult from the date that a determination that they are an adult is made.Unaccompanied minors can sponsor family members to Australia under the Humanitarian program or under the Migration program. Under the Humanitarian program, a minor who has been granted a permanent Refugee and Humanitarian, Protection or Resolution of Status visa can be the proposer for a Humanitarian visa for relatives including their immediate family members (including spouses or de-facto partners; dependent children, including step and adopted children; and parents, including step and adoptive parents).  However, an application made with respect to a parent can only be granted where the proposer is under the age of 18 at both time of application and at the time of decision. Under the Migration program, a person must generally be over the age of 18 years in order to sponsor family members under the Family stream. However, in the Remaining Relative, Carer, Parent and Partner visa classes there is a provision that allows certain other people to be the sponsor on the minor's behalf. Family members eligible to be sponsored or proposed under the family stream of the Migration program and under the Humanitarian Program are outline below:ProgramRelatives able to be sponsored or proposedHumanitarian ProgramHumanitarian (subclasses 200 - 204)Spouses, de facto partners, parents (including adoptive parents), children (including adopted children), siblings, grandparents, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews, cousins, distant relatives and friends. Relatives include step-relatives. Migration ProgramParent (subclass 103, 804) and Contributory Parent (subclasses 143, 173, 864 and 884)Parents (including step and adoptive parents) who satisfy the Balance of Family (BoF) test. This requires them to demonstrate that at least half of their children are lawfully and permanently resident in Australia or, alternatively, that they have more children lawfully and permanently resident in Australia than in any other single country.Carer (subclasses 836 and 116)Grandparents (including step-grandparents), grandchildren (including step-grandchildren), aunts/uncles (including step-aunts/uncle), nieces/nephew (including step-nieces/nephews) in addition to spouses, de facto partners, parents (including step and adoptive parents), children (including step and adoptive children), and siblings (including step-siblings)Remaining Relative (subclasses 835 and 115)Children (including step and adoptive children), siblings and step-siblingsPartner (subclasses 300, 309, 100, 820 and 801)Prospective spouse, spouse or de facto partner.                                               It should be noted that, depending on the visa class applied for, there may additional criteria relating to the relationship between an applicant and their sponsor or proposer, which might prevent a visa being granted.  For example, in order to propose an immediate family member under the Humanitarian program, the immediate family member must have been a family member at the time that the proposer's visa was granted (where the proposer was granted a Refugee or Humanitarian visa) or at the time that the proposer made their visa application (where the proposer was granted a Protection or Resolution of Status visa).It should be noted that, depending on the visa class applied for, there may additional criteria relating to the relationship between an applicant and their sponsor or proposer, which might prevent a visa being granted.  For example, in order to propose an immediate family member under the Humanitarian program, the immediate family member must have been a family member at the time that the proposer's visa was granted (where the proposer was granted a Refugee or Humanitarian visa) or at the time that the proposer made their visa application (where the proposer was granted a Protection or Resolution of Status visa).Normal service standards apply to the processing of visa applications, regardless of whether the sponsor or proposer is an unaccompanied minor. The Department is unable to provide details of the number and type of visas granted to family members of unaccompanied minors as this level of detail is not captured by Departmental records. </DOC>

The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) suspended the Responsible Superannuation Entity (RSE) licence of Trio Capital Limited (Trio) on 16 December 2009 and appointed an acting trustee to the five superannuation entities previously under Trio's trusteeship ('Acting Trustee'). APRA subsequently cancelled Trio's RSE licence in April 2010.The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) suspended Trio's Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) on 17 December 2009 following the voluntary appointment by Trio of administrators. ASIC is in the process of cancelling Trio's AFSL.The decision to suspend Trio was taken to protect members' assets and to ensure that members' assets were in independent hands. The suspensions did not cause loss to the members.ASIC identified the Astarra Strategic Fund (ASF) as a fund of concern during September 2009 as part of a surveillance of the sector. When ASIC could not get satisfactory answers on the ASF's overseas investments, ASIC advised APRA and investigations were commenced in October 2009. Those investigations continue and are directed at identifying wrong-doing and the conduct of various parties, including financial advisors and auditors. ASIC's investigation also includes the ARP Growth Fund, which was a managed investment scheme operated by Trio. At this time it is not possible to make any further comment regarding the recovery of funds, civil action or prosecutions until these investigations are completed, except to note that in October 2010, an application was lodged by the Acting Trustee with the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation for financial assistance under Part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the Application). The Application seeks compensation for the loss suffered by the eligible APRA regulated Trio superannuation entities as a result of fraudulent conduct or theft in connection with ASF. This compensation is not available under existing legislation to self-managed superannuation funds, who are understood to have been the majority investors in the ARP Growth Fund. The Trio superannuation funds regulated by APRA did not invest in the ARP Growth Fund.The Minister has sought APRA's advice on the compensation application, as required by legislation. APRA is currently considering its response to the Minister's request for advice on the application for compensation. Given the complexity of the application it will take APRA some time to provide a final assessment.</DOC>

In 1988, the Commonwealth Government announced the Loose Asbestos Insulation Removal Program to remove pure loose-fill asbestos insulation from affected Canberra houses at public expense. This program was undertaken by the Commonwealth as a result of its state government role in the ACT. With the introduction of self government in 1988, the program was transferred to the ACT on a shared funding arrangement. The Department of Urban Services (ACT) administered the program which concluded in 1993. Commonwealth funding was provided through the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. The Commonwealth's contribution to the program was approximately $56million. The ACT contributed $44million. No more precise figures are able to be provided due to the time that has elapsed since the program was undertaken.The Minister does not administer any Government programs related to providing financial assistance to home owner occupiers in NSW whose properties are contaminated with friable asbestos. The Minister has no discretionary power to provide any support, funding or assistance as no funds have been appropriated for this purpose.</DOC>

Safety is a priority for the Government across stimulus programs. Under the Building the Education Revolution (BER) program, measures are in place to deal with the identification of hazardous materials in schools, including asbestos, prior to construction commencing and for dealing with the treatment of those materials if discovered after construction has commenced.State and territory governments and non-government education authorities are responsible for managing the implementation of Building the Education Revolution (BER) projects. The Bilateral Agreements and Funding Agreements entered into between the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments and non-government education authorities require compliance with all relevant statutes, regulations, by-laws and requirements of any Commonwealth, state, territory or local authorities, including those that pertain to the handling of hazardous materials.For example, BER projects in NSW are administered by three education authorities, representing government, Independent and Catholic schools. In relation to the asbestos management action plans in place for government school projects, the NSW Department of Education and Training advises that it requires all Managing Contractors to complete hazardous materials investigations. If hazardous materials are found at a school, the Principal is informed, and depending on the materials found, Workcover and the NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change are also informed, as required by law. Where appropriate, construction work is halted until any remediation work is carried out.The Association of Independent Schools of NSW advises that its schools are aware of their requirement to comply with all local council laws, building codes and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations, and that adherence to these requirements, or procedures pertaining to the handling of hazardous materials during the building process, are embedded into builder's contracts.The NSW Catholic Block Grant Authority advises that the diocesan Facility Management Groups in NSW are experienced in the identification, removal and remediation of sites contaminated by a range of hazardous materials, including asbestos, in accordance with relevant laws and other requirements. Safety to students, teachers, workers and the community is part of their contractual arrangements.</DOC>

Exemptions from the deeming provisions are considered on a case by case basis in accordance with long standing guidelines first put in place following the introduction of extended deeming in 1996. These guidelines ensure consistent and equitable treatment of all requests for exemptions.Deeming exemptions are granted when financial investments have fundamentally failed and other criteria have been met. These criteria are that the policy intent of deeming not be compromised by the granting of an exemption, the financial investments (or a class of financial investments) are not operating to provide any returns and investors have no access at all to the investment capital. This includes cases where it is accepted that the investors have commenced all reasonable action to obtain access to the investment and the investment is currently inaccessible.Colonial First State Mortgage Fund Investments decided to terminate their mortgage fund and return capital to investors. The fund sought a deeming exemption and the request was considered under the guidelines.In the case of Colonial First State Mortgage Fund Investments, the fund has not failed but is being terminated in accordance with its trust deed and capital is being repaid to investors. As the guidelines were not satisfied, a deeming exemption was not granted.</DOC>

I am advised British Forces in Afghanistan do not use a Tiered Body Armour System.From what limited information is available publicly, and from senior Defence Materiel Organisation staff viewing the British body armour system, it is assessed that it offers a similar level of ballistic protection as Tier 3 of the Tiered Body Armour System and the Modular Combat Body Armour System. The United Kingdom system also has add-on extremity protection similar to the Modular Combat Body Armour System.</DOC>

In June 2010, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) implemented eligibility changes for the APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC). The imperative behind the changes, and the urgency with which they were implemented, was to maintain the goodwill of other APEC members who had noted Australia's comparatively generous criteria and the fact that Australian cardholders, at the time, represented 30 per cent of all cardholders in the ABTC scheme.The purpose of the amendments was to urgently counter any perception that Australia was either using the scheme for its own self-interest or did not respect the approach taken more broadly by other APEC members, mindful that each ABTC application creates significant work for all participating economies.Importantly, Australia's underlying objective was to maintain the goodwill of other APEC members as this is relied upon to preserve the benefits and long-term viability of the ABTC scheme. Australia also relies heavily on this goodwill to pursue more significant and far-reaching trade and investment-related initiatives within APEC.To ensure that Australia's ABTC appropriately supports small to medium sized business owners in their international trade and investment activities, DIAC will be undertaking a review of the current eligibility criteria. This review is underway and will involve consultation with key business organisations, including the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia and bilateral business councils. DIAC's Industry Outreach Officers, who work with these organisations on a regular basis, have also provided a list of key stakeholders including small to medium sized businesses to be involved in the consultations.This will provide opportunity for the needs of small to medium sized businesses to be emphasised in the process of determining whether consideration should be given to changing the current criteria to offer eligibility to a wider range of Australian business applicants.DIAC does not accept that small to medium businesses will face layoffs due to inability to undertake and sustain certain business activities by not holding an APEC Business Travel Card. While the APEC Business Travel Card scheme allows accredited business people to undertake multiple short-term visits to other APEC economies over a three year period through a single application, it is not the only means for business people to travel within the APEC region. Business people can apply for individual visas to conduct short business visits in each of the APEC economies necessary for their individual business needs.</DOC>

The location of the headquarters does not limit the employment of the company. For example, the 9th Brigade's region encompasses Tasmania and an RRF company could be deployed from Adelaide to Tasmania if required.The RRF unit establishment figures are not included in the establishment figures of the High Readiness Reserve (HRR). Personnel are unable to serve in both the RRF and HRR concurrently. The HRR is a separate category of Army Reserve service and therefore has its own discrete establishment.</DOC>
