                              (1) Yes. Mr Gao was one of Australia's cases of concern submitted to Chinese authorities immediately prior to the 13th Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Beijing on 20 December 2010. We have not yet received a response from China.                              (2) Yes. China's response on (a) was that Mr Gao's case was in the judicial process, and it was therefore not appropriate to comment on his case, and on (b) that Mr Gao was a Chinese citizen and a criminal who had broken Chinese laws, and that China was a country ruled by law and did not welcome outside interference.              </DOC>

                              There are three Australian think tanks or policy institutes that are funded by the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio.

                              (1) I (Mr Rudd) can confirm that Senegal severed diplomatic relations with Iran on 23 February 2011 and that these relations have not since been restored. A communiqué of the Senegalese Council of Ministers Meeting of 24 February 2011 stated that the President of Senegal condemned Iran's involvement and responsibility in the killing of Senegalese soldiers, through the supply of arms and munitions to rebels in the South Casamance region of Senegal. The communiqué stated that the Senegalese army's ballistics expert had proven that munitions used against the Senegalese soldiers were of Iranian origin. DFAT is not aware of any reference to arms shipments through Nigeria in any statements on the matter by the Government of Senegal.                               (2) (a) The Australian Government has received no formal notification regarding the arms shipment from Iran. United Nations Security Council resolutions in relation to Iran prohibit Iran from supplying, as well as all States from procuring from Iran, any arms or related materiel or goods with an application in nuclear weapons programs or in the development of weapons delivery systems.                              (b) I cannot confirm media reports that the ship transporting the arms was owned by CMA-CGM.                              (3) According to information available to DFAT, the Victoria is a registered German vessel. I cannot confirm media reports that the Victoria was owned by the Peter Doehle Company of Germany. The feeder (shipping) company was CMA-CGM of France. An inspection of the ship's cargo by Israeli authorities in the Port of Ashdod revealed 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition in three containers, including:                              232 mortar shells (120mm) with rocket boosters                              2280 M61 mortar shells (60mm) with fuses                              6 Nasr-1 (C-704) anti-ship missiles                              2 naval radars for anti-ship missiles                              2 naval control stations for anti-ship missiles                              2 C-704 launchers                              66,240 bullets for Kalashnikov assault rifles (7.62mm calibre)                              The instruction manual attached to the Nasr-1 missiles on board the Victoria was in Farsi and carried the emblems of Iran and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The mortar shells were manufactured in Iran and accompanied by a range table in Farsi.                               Iran is prohibited by UNSC resolution 1747 from supplying arms or related materiel. All States are prohibited from procuring from Iran weapons on the UN Register of Conventional Arms, including battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, large-calibre artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships and missiles and missile launchers.                              (4) Yes. According to information provided to DFAT by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service:                              (a) Between 1 January 2007 and 18 November 2011, twenty four ships operated by CMA-CGM have arrived directly into Australian ports from overseas on a total of two hundred and seventy seven occasions. The majority of the arrivals were into Melbourne (117), Fremantle (71) and Botany Bay (56).                               (b) Customs and Border Protection manages a range of risks to the Australian border including prohibited, restricted and regulated goods. All air and sea cargo is risk-assessed electronically and all cargo identified as high risk is subject to physical examination. As part of normal Customs and Border Protection business, cargoes on CMA-CGM vessels were subject to these processes, and therefore inspected. No breaches of United Nations Security Council Resolutions have been identified.              </DOC>

                              Ai Weiwei was released on bail on 22 June 2011. I am aware that Mr Ai currently has legal representation. The Australian Government looks to the Chinese authorities to deal with Mr Ai's case in a timely, fair and transparent manner.                              I raised Mr Ai's case with the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Mr Jia Qinglin, in Canberra in April 2011. Mr Ai was also on Australia's list of cases of human-rights concern passed to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April.                              Australia has made regular representations on behalf of dissidents in China and continues to engage China on cases of concern. Gauging the effectiveness of individual representations on human-rights matters is difficult. It is Australia's aim that our representations, taken together with representations by others in the international community, will encourage respect for human rights in China, including for detained political dissidents.              </DOC>

In view of this, the funding set aside in the 2011-12 Budget for implementation of the Malaysia Arrangement will be re-examined in the context of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.              </DOC>

                              The Government's objective is that NBN Co's fibre network cover 93 per cent of Australian homes, schools and work places. The indicator of where the fibre network is expected to be rolled out is 1,000 premises, not 1,000 people as suggested in the question.                               All premises beyond the 93 per cent fibre footprint will be served by a combination of next-generation fixed-wireless and satellite technologies providing peak speeds of 12 megabits per second. These platforms will provide customers with significantly improved service with average data rates higher than most users of these technologies experience today in metropolitan areas and certainly higher than the current average DSL speeds.                              NBN Co is considering proposals to extend the fibre to the premises coverage in some locations if external funding - such as from state or local governments - can be provided to offset the incremental costs.              </DOC>

                              NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) revised the second release sites program taking into account delays in finalising the Definitive Agreements with Telstra, and to align with the government's points of interconnection policy.                               NBN Co has now released its first 12-month national fibre rollout schedule, which lists the communities in each state and territory where work will begin between now and September 2012. Design and construction work has already begun on the Victoria Park site, which will cover 16,200 premises. A detailed rollout map of the Victoria Park site was released on 14 November 2011.                               NBN Co expects that it will take on average 12 months from the start of the fibre network rollout in a given area until NBN services become available.              </DOC>

                              As stated in response to Question No. 110, a detailed National Broadband Network Implementation Study undertaken by McKinsey &amp; Company/KPMG was completed in March 2010 and publicly released on 6 May 2010.                               The Implementation Study provided 84 recommendations for the government to consider, covering technology, financing, ownership, policy and market structure.                               On 20 December 2010, the government released the NBN Co Limited Corporate Plan, which shows that the National Broadband Network will provide all Australians with world class broadband on a financially viable basis with affordable consumer prices. That is, the project is feasible if structured on the basis of a rate of return above the government bond rate.                              The government made its investment decision to provide equity to fund the National Broadband Network on the basis of the advice of NBN Co that the project was feasible, supported by independent verification by financial advisory firm Greenhill Caliburn.              </DOC>

                              No. Although the benefits to travellers of appropriate insurance coverage are clear, the department provides consular assistance whether travellers have insurance or not. Consular staff are not always made aware of travel insurance coverage at the time that consular assistance is provided and cannot compel Australian citizens to provide details of travel insurance. Insurance policies are private contracts between travellers and the insurers.               </DOC>

(2) The estimated number of potentially eligible households in each of the switchover areas, based on information from Centrelink, is:                                                             (3) Extensive work is undertaken to estimate the number of households that may seek assistance under the scheme, taking account of factors such as digital conversion in the home, including via pay TV. It is estimated the total number of households that will take up the assistance available will be around 700 000.  The projected number in each switchover area is not disclosed in advance, as disclosure of this information would compromise future negotiations with tenderers in remaining switchover areas.

                              (1) The Household Assistance Scheme (HAS) has already been rolled out to the Mildura/Sunraysia, regional South Australia and Broken Hill, and regional Victoria switchover areas. It is currently being rolled out in regional Queensland.                              (a) The take-up of potentially eligible households for each area where the rollout has been completed is:                              (i) Mildura/Sunraysia 35.9%;                               (ii) regional South Australia/Broken Hill 34.5%; and                              (iii) regional Victoria 22.96%.                               (b) The estimated number of potentially eligible households for each area, based on information from Centrelink, is:                              (i) Mildura/Sunraysia 7 386                              (ii) regional South Australia/Broken Hill 29 387                              (iii) regional Victoria 120 434                              (iv) regional Queensland    123 351                              (2) Extensive work is undertaken to estimate the number of households that may seek assistance under the scheme, taking account of factors such as digital conversion in the home, including via pay TV. It is estimated the total number of households that will take up the assistance available will be around 700 000.

(3) Yes. See (2).                              (4) The 2009-10 Federal Budget allocated $69.5 million to rollout HAS to the Mildura/Sunraysia, regional South Australia and Broken Hill, regional Victoria and regional Queensland switchover areas. The 2011-12 Federal Budget allocated $308.8 million to rollout HAS to all remaining switchover areas. Of these appropriations, as at 30 September 2011, the Department had expensed $23.2 million in relation to the rollouts in the above switchover areas. This does not include expenses incurred by Centrelink. The expense incurred in each rollout area is not disclosed, as disclosure of this information would compromise future negotiations with tenderers in remaining switchover areas. As a demand-driven program, any savings from a lower-than-expected uptake are returned to the Budget.              </DOC>

                              (a) and (b)(i)(ii) State and Territory Governments are responsible for setting public housing rents. It is the Australian Government's intention that carbon price assistance is not included in the calculation of public housing rents by State and Territory Governments.                               The Prime Minister has written to all State and Territory Premiers and Chief Ministers, seeking confirmation that the Clean Energy Advance and the Clean Energy Supplements be permanently exempt from public housing rent calculations. The Prime Minister also asked that this exemption also be extended to community housing providers to ensure equity with public housing tenants.                               This request is consistent with the current approach where supplements to government payments, such as the Pension Supplement and Carer Supplement, are excluded from public housing rent calculations.              </DOC>

                              (a) NBN Co is still undertaking its post implementation review to examine the quality of the outcomes in first release sites and to ensure that the lessons have been documented, communicated and applied in subsequent projects.                              (b) On 1 June 2011, NBN Co announced that it had entered into an agreement covering all brownfield construction in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT which represents almost 40 per cent of national construction activity planned over the next two years.                               On 18 October 2011, NBN Co released its first 12-month national rollout plan. The schedule lists the communities in each state and territory where work on the fibre network will begin before September 2012. This national rollout plan indicates the following:                                                             NBN Co has advised that this schedule will be updated quarterly and that an indicative three-year schedule will be released in 2012.                              (c) NBN Co receives hundreds of new applications each month and as such, the following numbers are taken as at 11 October 2011. NBN Co plans delivery of fibre to precede premises being occupied in all contracted developments. The average number of days from application assessment to contract signature is 33 days.                              (d) As of 11 October 2011, the number of developer contracts under which construction is expected to be completed is 596 for 2011-12, 341 for 2012-13 and 4 for 2013-14.                               (e) On 13 May 2011, NBN Co announced that it had appointed Fujitsu Australia Limited as its prime alliance partner to deliver fibre infrastructure to new developments. Under the agreement, Fujitsu will manage the design, construction and associated works for the deployment of fibre to new developments, with the initial value estimated at over $100 million for the first 12 months. Information contained within the NBN Co/Fujitsu contract is a commercial matter for both companies.                              (f) The bow-wave applications represent the backlog of requests received from developers for fibre deployments that were not completed prior to NBN Co becoming the provider of last resort on 1 January 2011. The transfer of these applications back to Telstra is a one-off occurrence and has already taken place.              </DOC>

                              The National Broadband Network (NBN) will support increased retail competition, which is expected to result in lower prices for consumer broadband services and drive increased usage by consumers.                              A number of retail service providers have already released their NBN service plans. These compare favourably with existing ADSL plans, while delivering superior performance and the option to upgrade to speeds much faster than those available on the copper network.

                              The Australian Government understands the importance of mobile telephony to Australians. In recent years the mobile phone carriers have significantly expanded their terrestrial mobile networks. Vodafone Hutchison Australia claims its networks currently cover more than 94 per cent of the Australian population. Optus claims its 3G network provides services to 97 per cent of the Australian population. Telstra claims its Next G network now provides mobile coverage to 99 per cent of Australians.                              For the most part the recent extension of mobile coverage across Australia has been based on commercial decisions by carriers. In making a decision to extend coverage to a particular area, carriers will consider a range of factors, including site availability, cost structures, likely levels of demand from users and overall economic viability of the service.                              Telstra is the only carrier that provides mobile telephony in the Charters Towers district. The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy sought advice from Telstra in regard to mobile coverage on the McEwen Highway between Charters Towers and Ravenshoe. Telstra advised they have on numerous occasions looked at the feasibility of providing coverage to this area. However, they have determined that it is not commercially viable to do so. Telstra also advised they will continue to review investment decisions as part of their ongoing network planning.                               In areas that are sparsely populated or have little passing traffic, often the only commercially viable option for mobile phone services is via satellite. Unlike terrestrial mobile coverage, satellite mobile phone services cover the entire Australian landmass and population, and are available from a number of providers.                               The Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme improves the affordability of mobile communications for people living and working in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage, by providing subsidies for the purchase of satellite phone handsets. The scheme provides up to $1000 for eligible applicants who live in areas without terrestrial mobile coverage or up to $700 for eligible applicants who live in areas that have coverage, but spend more than 180 days across a two year period in non-coverage areas.                               Under the scheme's rules, those eligible to apply include individuals, small businesses, community groups, not-for-profit organisations, Indigenous corporations, emergency service organisations, health organisations and educational institutions. Further information is available at www.dbcde.gov.au/satphone.               </DOC>

                              In the past year, my department has made good progress on implementing key foundation elements to support Service Delivery Reform. Progress on initiatives outlined in the Scorecard includes:                                                Common service delivery: the Department of Human Services is achieving more cost effective and efficient service delivery by integrating Medicare Australia, Centrelink, and the Department of Human Services (including Chid Support Program) into a single department of state. An expanded range of services is available to customers through co-located Medicare, Centrelink and Child Support services. It is intended that all offices will be co-located by 2014 15.                                                Case management: my department is providing more intensive support for those who need it. Case coordination trials will involve assessing a customer's whole circumstances and providing more integrated support for vulnerable people and people facing complex or multiple challenges.                              There are seven trial sites as at 26 October 2011, with 44 sites to be rolled out across Australia by 2014-15.                                                Local Connections to Work supports the Government's participation agenda through nine sites offering joined up services to long-term unemployed job seekers. This is a new initiative that provides joint interviews with a range of service providers for people in disadvantaged locations who have been unemployed for some time. There will be 24 Local Connections to Work sites in disadvantaged locations by 2014-15.                                                Automation, authentication and registration: my department is providing better online services for those customers who choose to self manage by moving towards simpler, easier and more efficient interactions through more automation, and streamlined and integrated registration processes.                               Since February 2011, customers have been able to lodge Medicare claims online. Currently, customers can claim a number of common claim types through online services, without the need to visit a shopfront.                               A single online entry point has been created for Human Services customers to access their online Centrelink, Medicare and Child Support accounts through australia.gov.au, rather than having to log into three separate accounts.                              Customers will be able to 'tell us once', if they wish. This means that if a customer wishes to update their information such as changes to address and phone number across different departmental programs, they can do it once, rather than going to each part of the department they deal with. Information will only be shared across the department with the customer's consent.                                                 Data management: as part of Service Delivery Reform, my department has carried out extensive work to ensure appropriate privacy protections, including regular consultation with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.                              The department will ensure that databases containing personal information collected for different programs remain logically separated.                               Service Delivery Reform will not extend to any clinical health records.                              Apart from the limited data that is already shared across the department, for example between Medicare Australia and Centrelink, personal information will only be shared between programs with customer consent or legislative authority.              </DOC>

                              (1) The US Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Program is moving from a Technology Development to an Engineering Manufacturing and Development phase, and should release a Request for Proposal to industry in late 2011.                              (2) In 2009 Australia committed USD $30.405 million (AUD $43.105 million) to participate in the Technology Development phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program. It is important to note that no contribution or commitment has been made by Australia to enter the next phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program.                               (3) This investment has allowed valuable insights and knowledge into the US program, three Australians to work inside the US Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Product Office, the opportunity for the Capability Development Group to refine requirements and for reliability, user and survivability testing to occur here in Australia. All this will directly support future stages of this project.                               (4) With specific reference to the United States Market, Thales (Australian Defence Industries at the time) endeavoured to enter the US market with the Bushmaster via a commercial partnering arrangement. The Department of Defence provided support to Thales in this process, including facilitation provided by the Defence Export Unit, and by providing original Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle requirements documentation to the US Government. In addition 'Team Australia', an Australian Government initiative where DMO joined with Australia's defence industry to showcase Australian defence capability solutions, promoted the Bushmaster at the Association of US Army (AUSA) Conference. To date there has been no success.              </DOC>

                              (1) NBN Co has not yet indicated dates for the fibre network rollout in the electorate of Forrest. However, NBN Co has now released its first 12-month national rollout schedule. The rollout schedule will be updated each quarter to include new locations and is available on NBN Co's website.                               NBN Co plans to complete the rollout of its fixed wireless network, including to some communities in the Forrest electorate, by 2015.                               On 1 July 2011, NBN Co launched its Interim Satellite Service (ISS) which offers improved broadband services to eligible users in regional areas, ahead of the introduction of a long term satellite solution in 2015.                              (2) Indicative coverage maps published by NBN Co suggest that Augusta, Bunbury, Busselton, Capel, Collie, Donnybrook, Dunsborough, Harvey, Margaret River, Nannup and Yarloop may be served by fibre to the premises technology.                               NBN Co's maps indicate that the towns of Boyanup and Cowaramup may be served by next generation fixed wireless technology providing speeds of 12 megabits per second (Mbps).                              All remaining premises will be served by next-generation satellite technology providing speeds of 12 Mbps.                              These maps are indicative only and the precise optic fibre footprint will only be known when NBN Co completes its detailed suburb-by-suburb, region-by-region designs for the network.                               (3) NBN Co's current network planning for the fibre footprint includes the assumption that, where transit backhaul passes communities with greater than 500 premises, the fibre footprint may be extended to cover these communities. Under these current network planning guidelines no community with less than 500 premises, even if passed by the fibre transit backhaul routes, will be connected to fibre.                              (4) NBN Co's detailed expenditure forecasts for cost to pass particular premises are commercial-in-confidence. Information on the expenditure associated with the rollout can be found in NBN Co's Corporate Plan.                               (5) NBN Co offers a wholesale-only service, and monthly retail costs are a matter for retail service providers. However, prices for NBN plans released to date compare very favourably to existing ADSL plans, while delivering a superior end user experience and the option to upgrade to faster speeds not available over the copper network.                              For example, Exetel has announced NBN plans starting from $34.50 for a 12 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload service with 20 gigabyte (GB) data allowance. iiNet has announced NBN plans starting from $49.95 per month for a 12 Mbps service with 40 GB of data allowance. Retail service providers also offer a range of plans with significantly higher speeds and data allowances for interested customers.                               Importantly, there is no additional line rental fee with NBN services, as typically charged by retailers for an ADSL service. Service providers such as Exetel and Internode provide a phone service at no extra charge with their broadband plans, and iiNet offers a phone service for an additional $9.95 per month with their broadband plans that includes free local and national calls.                              The government expects that retail service providers will continue to announce competitive NBN pricing plans in the coming months.              </DOC>

                              The Minister has a number of powers that are set out in Part 5-2  -  General enforcement methods, of the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 (the Act), that enables the Minister to intervene in a matter involving a private health insurance policy holder and a private health insurer that involves the insurer's compliance with its enforceable obligations.                              Section 185-1 of the Act sets out that the Minister has the power to find out whether a private health insurer is complying with its enforceable obligations and to encourage or compel an insurer to comply with those obligations. The Minister can:                              (a) set performance indicators for insurers;                              (b) seek explanations from the insurers;                              (c) investigate insurers;                              (d) obtain enforceable obligations from insurers;                              (e) direct insurers to do particular things;                              (f) seek remedies in the Federal Court;                              (g) revoke an insurer's entitlement to offer tax rebates as premium reductions.                              Section 185-5 of the Act sets out the enforceable obligations an insurer must comply with under the Act. Pertinent to a matter that may involve a private health insurance policy holder and a private health insurer, these are:                              (a) a provision of the Act;                              (b) a provision of any Private Health Insurance Rules made under section 333-20 or 333-25 of the Act;                              (c) a direction given to a private health insurer under the Act.              </DOC>

                              The focus of Australian Government recognition of Her Majesty The Queen's Diamond Jubilee will be support for and involvement with the 'Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust '. As jointly announced by Prime Minister Cameron and me during CHOGM in Perth on 28 October 20 II, Buckingham Palace has agreed to the creation of the Trust, which will be chaired by former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK), Sir John Major.                              Both the Australian and UK Governments have confirmed that they will play their part in supporting the Trust. The amount of money the Australian Government will make available to the Trust has not yet been determined.                              Both Prime Minister Cameron and I also encourage individuals and businesses across the Commonwealth to mark the Jubilee by supporting the Trust in their own way. I am of the view that together, this will make a very fitting tribute to a very special anniversary.                              I will make further announcements about Australian Government recognition of The Queen's Diamond Jubilee.                              I can confirm that the Australian Government will not be issuing a Diamond Jubilee medal. To do so would be inconsistent with the Australian honours system which does not include coronation or jubilee medals.              </DOC>

I also understand there have not been any proposals referred for assessment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.                              (3) No. The process of identifying any contacts, discussions or decisions made by Members of Parliament over the last 30 years would involve a substantial and unreasonable diversion of public service resources, given the extent of documents which would need to be searched and the considerable number of third parties requiring consultation and consent.              </DOC>

                              (1) Bowen Airport is a part of the Bureau's Cooperative Observer network which is a manual network. Bowen Airport provides observations up to every three hours.                               (2) The Bureau of Meteorology operates a composite weather observations network which uses a range of technologies to inform the forecasting process. In the early stages of cyclone forecasting, and prior to landfall, key information is provided by a number of tools such as satellite and radars, supplemented by offshore automatic weather stations. Typically, land-based manual and automatic weather stations are used to provide confirmation of the forecast and to assist with impact assessment.                               (3) There is an existing network of seven automatic weather stations along the Townsville to Proserpine coastline as well as several manual stations and offshore weather stations. A weather station providing higher frequency data is not likely to make a significant difference to the accuracy of the forecast in this area because the existing network provides adequate information to inform the models and forecasters.              </DOC>

                              In calculating the program-average benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 2.65 in the media release, the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) used the project-specific BCRs supplied by project proponents to the Department of Infrastructure and Transport as part of the current Nation Building Program's appraisal process. Where necessary, the project-specific BCRs were adjusted to use a standard 4.4% discount rate, consistent with the Nation Building Program's Notes on Administration. The program-average BCR is the average of the project BCRs, discounted at 4.4% and weighted by outturn project costs.               </DOC>

                              (1) and (2) Information about the over 3,680 items which have incurred the two per cent and five per cent price reductions on 1 February 2011 are provided in Attachment A and Attachment Bwhichis available from the House of Representatives Table Office.                              Tables 1 and 2 below provide details of the pharmaceutical items which took a 16 per cent statutory price reduction on 1 April 2011 or 1 August 2011, the two occasions on which these reductions have occurred since the 16 per cent price reduction was introduced. The tables also provide the price (dispensed price maximum quantity) before and after the price reduction.                                                                  Table 1  -  Pharmaceutical Items which took a 16 percent statutory price reduction on 1                                                      April                                                      2011                                                General schedule prices, unless indicated otherwise. Dispensed price maximum quantity may not reflect exactly the 16% reduction as the reduction is calculated on the price exclusive of pharmacy mark ups and fees.                              *Highly Specialised Drug (HSD) - public hospital price                                                                  Table 2 - Pharmaceutical Items which took a 16 percent statutory price reduction on 1 August 2011                                               General schedule prices, unless indicated otherwise. Dispensed price maximum quantity may not reflect exactly the 16% reduction as the reduction is calculated on the price exclusive of pharmacy mark ups and fees.                              (2) (d) The projected saving to Government from the whole package of Further PBS Reforms (which also include Expanded and Accelerated Price Disclosure) is provided in the table below and is available from the Departments Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements of 2010-11. Any further breakdown is Budget-in-Confidence.                                                                  Further PBS Reform                                              (3) On 1 February 2011, a two percent and five percent statutory price reduction applied to all Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listed brands of non-exempt pharmaceutical items containing drugs which were listed on the F2A and F2T formularies as at 11 October 2010, respectively. These reductions were required under the National Health Act 1953 (the Act). The Act provided for exemptions from these price reductions in the following circumstances:                              Section 99ACG of the Act exempted pharmaceutical items from these reductions if a 12.5 percent statutory price reduction or a price disclosure reduction had been applied previously; and                              Section 84AH of the Act empowers the Minister to determine, by legislative instrument, that a pharmaceutical item is an 'exempt item' if the pharmaceutical item satisfies the criteria in that section. The intention of this exemption is to encourage availability of presentations of drugs that are used by a demographic subgroup, for example, a liquid presentation for children.                               Information on the items which were exempted from these statutory price reductions can be accessed through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme website (www.pbs.gov.au) and the Australian Government ComLaw website (www.comlaw.gov.au) and is reproduced in the following tables.                              _______________                                                                  * Department of Health and Ageing Annual Report 2010-11.

                              (1) By what date is the National Broadband Network (NBN) scheduled to be rolled-out in the electoral division of Dawson.                              As outlined in its 2011-2013 Corporate Plan, NBN Co forecasts it will take 9.5 years to build the NBN. It is expected to be completed by December 2020.                               NBN Co has not yet indicated dates for the fibre network rollout in the electorate of Dawson. However, NBN Co has now released its first 12-month national rollout schedule. The rollout schedule will be updated each quarter to include new locations and is available on NBN Co's website.                               NBN Co plans to complete the rollout of its fixed wireless network, including to some communities in the Dawson electorate, by 2015.                               On 1 July 2011, NBN Co launched its Interim Satellite Service (ISS) which offers improved broadband services to homes and small businesses unable to access to a metro-comparable broadband service, ahead of the introduction of a long term satellite solution in 2015.                              (2) Which towns in this electorate (a) will, and (b) will not, have a fibre optic cable connection to premises.                              Indicative coverage maps published by NBN Co suggest that Mackay, Seaforth, Proserpine, Airlie Beach, Ayr and Home Hill in the electorate of Dawson may be served by fibre to the premises technology.                               NBN Co's maps indicate that communities in the less densely populated areas surrounding the towns of Mackay, Seaforth, Proserpine, Bowen, Ayr, Home Hill, and south of Townsville, may be served by next generation fixed wireless technology providing speeds of 12 megabits per second (Mbps).                               All remaining premises will be served by satellite technologies providing speeds of 12 Mbps.                              These maps are indicative only and the precise optic fibre footprint will only be known when NBN Co completes its detailed suburb-by-suburb, region-by-region designs for the network.                               (3) Through which towns in this electorate will the NBN fibre connection pass without being connected to premises because the towns lay outside the NBN's agreed fibre connection zone.                              NBN Co's current network planning for the fibre footprint includes the assumption that, where transit backhaul passes communities with greater than 500 premises, the fibre footprint may be extended to cover these communities. Under these current network planning guidelines no community with less than 500 premises, even if passed by the fibre transit backhaul routes, will be connected to fibre.                              The precise optic fibre footprint will only be known when NBN Co completes its detailed suburb-by-suburb, region-by-region designs for the network.                               (4) What is the estimated cost of connecting premises to the NBN in each town in this electorate in the year it will be rolled-out, and the subsequent two years.                              NBN Co's detailed expenditure forecasts for cost to pass particular premises are commercial-in-confidence. Information on the expenditure associated with the rollout can be found in NBN Co's Corporate Plan.                               (5) What is the estimated monthly cost of NBN provision for an average household in this electorate in the year it will be rolled-out.                              NBN Co offers a wholesale-only service, and monthly retail costs are a matter for retail service providers. However, prices for NBN plans released to date compare very favourably to existing ADSL plans, while delivering a superior end user experience and the option to upgrade to faster speeds not available over the copper network.                              For example, Exetel has announced NBN plans starting from $34.50 for a 12 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload service with 20 gigabyte (GB) data allowance. iiNet has announced NBN plans starting from $49.95 per month for a 12 Mbps service with 40 GB of data allowance. Retail service providers also offer a range of plans with significantly higher speeds and data allowances for interested customers.                               Importantly, there is no additional line rental fee with NBN services, as typically charged by retailers for an ADSL service. Service providers such as Exetel and Internode provide a phone service at no extra charge with their broadband plans, and iiNet offers a phone service for an additional $9.95 per month with their broadband plans that includes free local and national calls.                              The government expects that retail service providers will continue to announce competitive NBN pricing plans in the coming months.                              (6) Why was the electoral division of Dawson not included in the first tranche of NBN funding.                              The first and second release sites were selected by NBN Co network planners and engineers because they represent the diverse situations the company will encounter during the network rollout. The sites provided an opportunity to test and document different design and construction techniques in a range of situations. The sites offer significant variety in terms of geography, housing type and density, local infrastructure and other local factors.                              In terms of the volume rollout schedule, engineering and logistic requirements have determined the order of sites being rolled out. Those requirements include access to core NBN infrastructure, such as the transit network and fibre access nodes.              </DOC>

                                                Details relating to Australian tourism sector businesses in (a) 2007 - 08, (b) 2008 - 09, (c) 2009 - 10, (d) 2010 - 11, and (e) 2011 - 12 (to date), are provided in the table below.                              * Grants Assessed to 18/11/2011.                                                                  Grant applications are normally lodged in the financial year after the year in which the export marketing expenses are incurred (except for first year applications where the application may cover expenses incurred in the previous two financial years)                  .                   The statistics shown here are for the years in which the applications were received.                                                                                  The successful applicants in the tourism sector for each year are listed in the following table.                                              The purpose of the grants in all cases was to provide incentives to small and medium Australian enterprises to develop export markets. Eligible export promotion expenses included marketing visits, overseas representation and marketing consultants, participation in trade fairs, communications, free samples, promotional literature and advertising, intellectual property and know-how and visits to Australia by overseas buyers.                                                 The target export destinations of these EMDG grant recipients were as indicated in the table below. Target export destination information of individual grant recipients is not publicly available (due to the disclosure restrictions of section 94 of the Australian Trade Commission Act, 1985). Below is information on target markets of all EMDG recipients from the tourism sector in aggregate rather than for individual grant recipients. Grant applicants can list up to 6 target markets and therefore the number of applicants indicating target markets below is greater than the number of grants paid.                                                                            </DOC>

                              (1) The Australian Government is committed to the continued availability of a voice-only service for those who need it. The government's retail price control framework provides a range of protections for consumers, including those on low-incomes.                              In conducting its review into arrangements for retail price controls, the government sought views on how low-income users should be provided with equitable access to affordable basic telecommunications services. The government is considering the submissions received in response to the review.              </DOC>

                              The Long Term Satellite Service will provide service improvements and support video conferencing and large file transfers. It will have the capacity to support a range of consumer and business grade services, including interactive distance learning services such as School of the Air. As outlined in NBN Co's Corporate Plan, the Long Term Satellite Service will be engineered to deliver high-speed broadband services by using Ka-band satellites to deliver peak download speeds of 12 Mbps and upload speeds of 1 Mbps. It is expected these services will provide a broadband experience equivalent to, or better than, what many people now experience on ADSL.                               Further, NBN Co is also investigating the introduction of higher upload speeds of 2 Mbps with a roadmap of 4 Mbps to support business services.                                                 Attachment A which can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office provides an NBN Co information paper regarding e-health Services in Indigenous Communities and further details the expected capabilities and benefits of the Long Term Satellite Solution. This paper notes that the final long term satellite product feature set and network capabilities will be determined once vendor selection and contracts have been finalised.              </DOC>

                              Mr Jim Hassell, Head of Product Development and Sales at NBN Co, advised in response to a Joint Committee on the NBN hearing on 27 July 2011 that the Interim Satellite Service would not affect the satellite network currently used by the Northern Territory School of the Air. Mr Hassell stated that:                              What they've already got in place, as I understand it anyway, is that they have the separate School of the Air network... It's not run over a standard network, it's a separate piece of infrastructure, it's a separate satellite dish that people have in their own homes and it's a completely separate service which is actually been designed to deliver remote education.                              With our interim solution we had to take internet capacity which is currently available in the market and use that. But when we launch our own we have greatly increased the capacity and we build on that our business grade services which is a whole range of kind of different service level commitment which allows you to give that kind of service.                              (www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-01/school-of-the-air-faces-long-wait-for-nbn-benefits/2818784).

                              A classified copy of a United States (US) Report into the helicopter crash on 21 June 2010 was available to the Australian Inquiry Officer who conducted the Australian Inquiry into the circumstances of the deaths of Private Tim Aplin, Private Benjamin Chuck and Private Scott Palmer. A copy of this classified US report was included in the evidence supporting the Australian Inquiry, which was completed in late 2010. This US report was provided to the Australian Inquiry Officer during the course of his Inquiry. It was not subject to a formal release process and not authorised for release at that time. Subsequently, the US Report has been provided to the families of Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer.                              This US report focussed on the cause of the accident in the context of the death of the US soldier who was also killed in the incident. The Australian Inquiry Officer drew from it in preparing his report. Accordingly, in preparing to release the Australian report, both to the families of Private Aplin, Private Chuck and Private Palmer and to the public, Defence needed to ensure that classified US information was not included in the material being released. Staff level liaison with US Defence personnel to ascertain the ability to release the US material included in the Australian report commenced at the beginning of December 2010.                               I am advised that in January 2011, the US Army provided an unclassified copy of the US report to the next-of-kin of the US soldier who was killed in the crash. A copy of this unclassified version of the US report was not received by Australian Defence personnel until the beginning of April 2011. At that time, Australian Defence staff in Washington were advised by their US Army counterparts who provided that US report that the US Army considered the briefing of the report to the next-of-kin as public release. A copy of the unclassified US report was received by the Chief of the Defence Force's Commissions of Inquiry Directorate in Australia in mid-April 2011.                               The delay in obtaining the unclassified version of the US report is acknowledged. This was the first instance in which Defence has had to conduct a combat death Inquiry in conjunction with another country. There were no established protocols for this.                              The US report mentioned above is one of two conducted by the US. The other was focussed on air safety. An Australian Officer attended this second investigation as an observer, and a substantial body of material from that investigation was also provided to Australia. My Office received a copy of the Australian Inquiry Officer's report on 8 August 2011, under cover of a submission seeking my approval for release of the Australian report.                               The Chief of the Defence Force has acknowledged that the Australian report should have moved through the Department much more quickly than this.                               After appropriate consideration of the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force and the content of the report, I approved disclosure of the Australian Inquiry Officer's report to the families in late September. Given the potential sensitivities involved with release of the Australian report, I also discussed its release with US Defence Secretary Panetta when I met with him in Brussels at the beginning of October 2011.                               Following my discussion with Secretary Panetta, an Australian Army representative met with the families of Privates Aplin, Chuck and Palmer on 12 and 13 October 2011 to provide them with a copy of the Australian report. In relation to the US report, a copy of the unclassified US report that is the focus of this Question on Notice was provided to the families of Privates Aplin, Chuck and Palmer by the Australian Defence Force on 20 October 2011. It was appropriate that the Australian Defence Force used the Australian Inquiry report as the basis for informing the Australian families.                               So far as the delay in release of the Inquiry report is concerned, the Australian Inquiry Officer report into the Blackhawk crash was managed by a small number of staff who support the Chief of the Defence Force directly on all operational and administrative issues with regard to the deaths of Australian Defence Force members. This Directorate was not staffed with sufficient suitably qualified personnel to manage concurrent inquiries into the 10 Australians killed in action during the period June to August 2011.                               The Chief of the Defence Force has effected remedial actions to minimise delays to the release of inquiry reports on combat deaths in the future.                               These measures include:                              Appointing a high calibre and experienced senior Army lawyer to lead the COI Directorate;                              Appointing a non-legal Chief of Staff to provide oversight, prioritisation and monitoring of all matters that are referred to, and processed within, the Directorate;                              Assigning additional legal staff resources to the directorate and strictly caveating their duty statements;                              Drafting a new CDF Directive and developing a dedicated chapter in the Administrative Inquiries Manual; and                              Placing the Directorate under the oversight of the recently appointed Director General Strategic Issues.                              While it may provide little comfort to the families, the Chief of the Defence Force has written to the families to apologise for the delay. I have apologised publicly and do so again.              </DOC>

                              (1) Each year Tourism Australia engages the support of industry partners and airlines in international cooperative marketing programs to ensure maximum leveraged state and territory government and private sector investment. Airline partnerships help to convert consumers' desire to travel to Australia into travel bookings through a combination of destination messaging in price point marketing. Tourism Australia currently has three global Memorandum of Understandings (MoU) in place, including two long-standing MoUs with Qantas, Singapore Airlines and a recently ratified agreement with Jetstar announced in October 2011. Tourism Australia's airline MoUs outline a long term spirit of cooperation and investment in international markets with each airline, usually at three-year intervals.                              In 2008-09, Tourism Australia directly invested $7.4 million AUD in international airline partnerships, resulting in a total of $18.5 million AUD worth of cooperative airline/destination marketing for Australia. Australia partnered with 16 airlines in 36 markets in a total of 60 campaigns.                              In 2009-10, Tourism Australia directly invested $17 million AUD in international airline partnerships, resulting in a total of $34.6 million AUD worth of cooperative airline/destination marketing for Australia. Australia partnered with 17 airlines in 32 markets in a total of 87 campaigns.                              In 2010-11, Tourism Australia directly invested $12.8 million AUD in international airline partnerships, resulting in a total of $23.3 million AUD worth of cooperative airline/destination marketing for Australia. Australia partnered with 14 airlines in 23 markets in a total of 50 campaigns.                              Note: Tourism Australia's contractual agreements with airlines prevent public disclosure of annual airline investments. The values listed above do not include Tourism Australia's cooperative investment in international media hosting or other trade and business events.                              (2) In 2011-12, Tourism Australia's planned investment in international airline partnerships is $16.5 million AUD with a projected total investment value of $34 million AUD.                              In October 2011, Tourism Australia signed a $9.6 million marketing deal with Jetstar aimed at boosting Japanese inbound tourism and further expanding brand Australia's presence in the Asia Pacific. The three year agreement runs to mid 2014 and will see Tourism Australia and Jetstar each contribute at least $1.6 million per year on a range of joint marketing, digital and social media activities.                               Note: Tourism Australia's contractual agreements with airlines prevent public disclosure of annual airline investments. The values listed above do not include Tourism Australia's cooperative investment in international media hosting, or other trade and business events.              </DOC>

The report also includes car transport costs as advised by other departments in respect of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries. The reports and supporting information are published on the Finance website.                                                                  Tourism Australia                                              Tourism Australia does not maintain records of travel costs by airline. Under Tourism Australia's travel policy, all carriers should be considered when booking air travel. As a general principle, air travel must be at best value subject to business purpose, security, safety and effectiveness of the individual. It is expected that all employees will take advantage of any advance purchase discounts offered by the airlines.

                                              (1) One hundred and twenty-two modern awards were made by the tribunal during the award modernisation process in 2008-09. The modern awards commenced operation on 1 January 2010. The awards are listed below:                                                             (2) The following extracts from a Full Bench statement in September 2008 and Full Bench decisions in December 2008 and September 2009 dealt with superannuation in modern awards:                              12 September 2008  -  [2008] AIRCFB 717                                                '                  [29] We do not think it is appropriate that the Commission conduct an independent appraisal of the investment performance of particular funds. Performance will vary from time to time and even long term historical averages may not be a reliable indicator of future performance. We are prepared to accept a fund or funds agreed by the parties, provided of course that the fund meets the relevant legislative requirements.'                               19 December 2008  -  [2008] AIRCFB 1000:                                                '                  [90] The terms of the exposure draft concerning the default fund provision were the cause of a number of submissions from employer and employee interests, from superannuation funds and the superannuation industry. We have decided to allow as a default fund any fund to which the employer was making contributions for the benefit of employees on 12 September 2008. This approach is likely to minimise inconvenience for employers. While funds other than those provided for will not qualify as default funds employees may still exercise their right to choose in favour of these funds.'                               2 September 2009  -  [2009] AIRCFB 800                                                 '                  [66] In our view the nomination of default funds should be made on some readily ascertainable basis and one which does not lead to any disruption. For that reason it was decided to provide for named default funds as the primary basis. The secondary basis was any fund to which the employer was making contributions before 12 September 2008. That date was chosen because it was the date on which the exposure drafts of the priority modern awards were published.                                                [67] A number of funds have since made applications to be included as named default funds on the basis that the fund was nominated as a default fund in an award-based transitional instrument relevant to the coverage of the modern award or on the basis that the representatives of the main parties covered by the award consent. In our view either basis would constitute a good reason for the fund being specified as a default fund in a modern award. Where such grounds exist an appropriate application could be made. We do not intend to deal with such applications, however, in this decision.                                                [68] Returning now to the proposal that we should change the relevant date from 12 September 2008 to 1 January 2010, and assuming the proposal could be characterised as a transitional provision, we doubt whether such a variation would go the heart of the matter. Most funds voicing objection to the default fund provision did so on the basis that they are fundamentally opposed to any limitation on the ability of an employer to choose the default fund. Simply substituting one date for another would not remedy that complaint. Indeed, it might create a deal of disruption in the industry between the publication of this decision and 1 January 2010.                                                [69] The relevant legislation provides for default funds to be included in awards. Our present view is that we should continue to provide for default funds where there is a history of award regulation of superannuation in the industry or occupation the modern award covers. It should be emphasised, however, that, self-evidently, the default fund provision only operates where the employee does not nominate a fund. The superannuation legislation enshrines the right of an employee to choose the fund into which the employer should make contributions. Consistently with the legislation the award provision does not limit an employee's right to nominate a fund. Nor does it limit the ability of superannuation funds which are not default funds to market their products to employees and employers. We have decided, on the basis of what has been put in the proceedings, not to alter the date of 12 September 2008.' [emphasis added]                              114 of the 122 modern awards contain a standard clause in relation to Superannuation. The provision is reproduced below: As outlined in the Full Bench decision [[2009] AIRCFB 800] highlighted in paragraph 69 above, the provisions makes it clear that the award only nominates a default fund to be used if the employee does not choose to nominate an alternate fund. Furthermore the obligation to pay superannuation is derived from Superannuation legislation listed below, not from the modern award.                                                                   1. Superannuation                   (Standard clause)                                                                                  1.1 Superannuation legislation                                              (a)Superannuation legislation, including the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth), the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Act 1992 (Cth), the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth) and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 (Cth), deals with the superannuation rights and obligations of employers and employees. Under superannuation legislation individual employees generally have the opportunity to choose their own superannuation fund. If an employee does not choose a superannuation fund, any superannuation fund nominated in the award covering the employee applies.                              (b)The rights and obligations in these clauses supplement those in superannuation legislation.                                                                  1.2 Employer contributions                                              An employer must make such superannuation contributions to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee as will avoid the employer being required to pay the superannuation guarantee charge under superannuation legislation with respect to that employee.                                                                  1.3 Voluntary employee contributions                                              (a)Subject to the governing rules of the relevant superannuation fund, an employee may, in writing, authorise their employer to pay on behalf of the employee a specified amount from the post-taxation wages of the employee into the same superannuation fund as the employer makes the superannuation contributions provided for in clause 0.                              (b)An employee may adjust the amount the employee has authorised their employer to pay from the wages of the employee from the first of the month following the giving of three months' written notice to their employer.                              (c)The employer must pay the amount authorised under clauses 0 or 0 no later than 28 days after the end of the month in which the deduction authorised under clauses 0 or 0 was made.                                                                  1.4 Superannuation fund                                              Unless, to comply with superannuation legislation, the employer is required to make the superannuation contributions provided for in clause 0 to another superannuation fund that is chosen by the employee, the employer must make the superannuation contributions provided for in clause 0 and pay the amount authorised under clauses 0 or 0 to one of the following superannuation funds or its successor:                               (a)Name(s) of default fund; or                              (b)any superannuation fund to which the employer was making superannuation contributions for the benefit of its employees before 12 September 2008, provided the superannuation fund is an eligible choice fund.                              The list below outlines the default superannuation fund(s) listed in each modern award:                                             </DOC>

                              Each reporting unit within a registered organisation is required to keep proper financial records with respect to its transactions and financial position.                              Sections 253 and 254 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 require a reporting unit to prepare general purpose financial reports and operating reports. In particular, under subsection 254 (2) (d), the operating report must give details (including details of the position held) of any officer or member of the reporting unit who is a trustee, or is a director of a company that is a trustee, of a superannuation entity or an exempt public sector superannuation scheme but only where eligibility for the officer or member being a trustee or director prescribes that the officer or member is an officer or member of a registered organisation.                              Failure to comply with this section can attract civil penalties.                              Fair Work Australia has made an inquiry under section 330 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 of the Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia as to whether subsection 254(d) has been complied with and is awaiting a response.              </DOC>

                              (a) The main reason concession cards do not have photo identification is cost. Costs would be incurred in several ways. There are more than five million existing card holders. Of these, a minimum of 22 per cent would be subject to renewal during a year. This figure excludes new grants and replacement cards. Cards are also commonly reissued when a customer changes address, name or payment types.                               (b) Yes, reports have been received of alleged misuse.                              The following arrangements are in place to mitigate against misuse:                               All cards have provision for a signature. A signature is only one method of determining that the person using a concession card is the person entitled to use it. This does not preclude a concession provider from seeking supporting evidence if they have any doubt about the identity of the person presenting the card;                              If a concession provider has doubts about the person's identity, they are within their rights to ask for more identification, such as driver's licence which does include a photograph. It is up to the concession provider to decide whether to offer the concession;                              When a customer changes their name, the Department of Human Services requires the change request in writing and in some cases, evidence to verify that they intend to use this new name in the community. Examples would include an Automatic Teller Machine card with the new name, a marriage certificate or driver's licence showing the changed name.                              Provided they meet the respective qualifications, customers are allowed to hold multiple cards. Different cards can provide varying concessions, with some being restricted to cardholders and others being extended to partners and dependants. One example would be a customer who can hold the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card as well as a Low Income Health Care Card;                              Concessions may be available not only to the card holder but also to other family members, for example dependent children and sometimes partners. The concession validation systems (detailed below) provide those details for the concession providers to enable concessions to be extended to those family members, where eligible;                              The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) Concession Entitlement Validation or PBS Online enables pharmacies to confirm whether a customer has concession entitlements for the provision of PBS prescriptions. This involves matching the customer's identity between Medicare and Centrelink. The customer has to present both their Medicare card and Centrelink concession card at point of purchase to allow this electronic confirmation. There is information on the Medicare website about obtaining concessions under the PBS  -  'Is your concession valid today'. The Medicare Safety Net is the other part of the Concession Entitlement Validation system, where details about the customer's identity, concession status and details of any Family Tax Benefit Part A payments are provided to Medicare from Centrelink;                              The Centrelink Confirmation eService is an online system designed to provide approved organisations with the means to verify and confirm that a cardholder has concession entitlements. Approved organisations include councils, transport authorities, water authorities, education authorities, banks, legal aid services, health services, welfare agencies, energy authorities, telecommunication authorities. Organisations must register with the Department of Human Services by completing a Deduction and Confirmation Services Business Application form. There is information and application forms on the Department of Human Services - Centrelink website by searching 'CCeS';and                              Confirmation of concession entitlement (or interim voucher) can be issued to customers to validate concession card entitlements where a customer has lost their concession card or has just been granted a concession card and needs to claim concession entitlements urgently before their new or replacement card arrives. It can also be requested by a customer if they are having trouble obtaining their concessions from the concession providers.               </DOC>

                                                (1) In the 2007-08 Budget, the market value of Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS) on issue as at 30 June 2008 was estimated to be $59.3 billion. The market value of CGS is not available on a daily basis. In the 2011-12 MYEFO, the market value of CGS on issue as at 30 June 2012 was estimated to be $253.5 billion.                               (2) In the 2007-08 Budget, the market value of CGS on issue as at 30 June 2008 as a percentage of GDP was estimated to be 5.0 per cent ($59.3 billion). In the 2011-12 MYEFO, the market value of CGS on issue as at 30 June 2012 as a percentage of GDP was estimated to be 17.0 per cent ($253.5 billion). The percentage point change in CGS between 2007-08 and 2011-12 is 12.0 per cent.                                                                   According to IMF data and estimates, between 2007 and 2011 general government gross debt in select OECD countries changed by the following:                                                                                  General government gross debt (as % of GDP)                                                                *IMF estimate.                                                #Note: Australian data is for the Australian Government general government sector, is sourced from the Budget papers and refers to financial years 2007-08 and 2011-12. Data for all other economies is for the total government sector and refer to calendar years beginning 2007 and 2011.                              Source: IMF Fiscal Monitor September 2011, 2007-08 Budget and 2011-12 MYEFO.                              (3) and (4) Information on the end-of-year market value of CGS on issue for the years 2011-12 to 2014-15 is published in Table B2 of the 2011-12 MYEFO. The face value of CGS on issue for the equivalent end of year period is expected to be lower than the market value for the years 2011-12 to 2014-15. The Government does not have any plans to amend the legislative limit and will continue to monitor the size of the CGS market.                              (5) The interest expense on CGS for the years 2007-08 to 2010-11 is published in Note 10 of the Final Budget Outcome for those years. The estimated interest expense on CGS for 2011-12 is reported in Note 10 of the 2011-12 MYEFO.                               (6). (a) The updated medium term budget projections included in the 2011-12 MYEFO show that the budget position is projected to improve over the medium term with net debt projected to return to zero in 2020-21.                              (b) Treasury's latest estimates of the Australian Federal structural budget balance, as well as detailed descriptions of the underlying methodology and assumptions, were published in the October 2010 Treasury Roundup article.                              For international comparisons, the IMF and OECD produce estimates of structural budget balances (including Australia's) across all levels of government in their Fiscal Monitor and Economic Outlook publications.              </DOC>

                              (1) and (2) Dabigatran (Pradaxa®) is currently listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacements.                               At its March 2011 meeting, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) recommended extending the current PBS listing of Pradaxa to include the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (a condition associated with an abnormal heart rhythm).                              However, in recommending the listing of PRADAXA on the PBS for patients at risk of stroke because they have atrial fibrillation, the PBAC noted the following:                              PRADAXA derives its advantage over warfarin when warfarin is used sub-optimally;                              improving the use of warfarin by means of an education campaign aimed at prescribers, pharmacists and patients would be less costly;                               the benefit of PRADAXA observed in the clinical trial may or may not be wholly reflected in the Australian population;                              a number of patients who are reluctant to take warfarin because of its stringent monitoring requirements and interactions with other drugs and foods may be treated with PRADAXA. This would likely lead to additional benefits and costs not measured in the trial;                               low risk patients currently managed on aspirin may be inappropriately transferred to PRADAXA; and                              listing PRADAXA would cost the budget up to $1 billion over the forward estimates.                               The Government has not deferred the extension to the listing of Pradaxa, but based on the PBAC's advice, the Government has decided to seek more information about how Pradaxa would fit into the current treatment options of Australian patients at risk of stroke.                               Emeritus Professor Lloyd Sansom AO, the former Chair of the PBAC, has been commissioned to review options for improving the health outcomes of patients treated with anticoagulation therapies.                              This review will consider how current treatments are used and what should be the role of newer therapies for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, such as Pradaxa.                               Unlike warfarin, where bleeding associated with the use of the drug can be quickly reversed with vitamin K, this solution is not available to treat bleeding associated with Pradaxa, and so it is more difficult to manage.                              The Therapeutic Goods Administration has already issued two safety advisory alerts regarding Pradaxa based on the increase in bleeding-related adverse events reports and new requirements for kidney function monitoring. The review being undertaken by Professor Sansom will take all these issues into account to ensure anticoagulant therapy in Australia delivers optimal health outcomes for all patients.                              Terms of Reference for the review are available on the Department's website at pbs.gov.au.                              (3) Details of the Minister for Health and Ageing's Submission to the Cabinet in relation to the proposed extension to the listing of this medicine on the PBS are Cabinet-In-Confidence.                               In addition, the detailed costing of the proposed extension to the PBS listing of Pradaxa contains Commercial-in-Confidence information.               </DOC>

However, in 2010-11 over 2.4 million Warfarin prescriptions were subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and over 232,000 prescriptions were subsidised through the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for a range of conditions. This does not include any prescriptions that were dispensed to general patients, as the cost of the drug is under the general co payment of $34.20.              </DOC>

                              (1) These data are not currently available. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report, How we manage stroke in Australia 2006 provides an overview of the associated risk factors and treatment of patients who have suffered a stroke. The Institute's report is available at www.aihw.gov.au/publication-detail/?id=6442467815                              (2) The management of atrial fibrillation is a complex and evolving medical area. The use of anticoagulants is one of a number of treatment options available and is clinically appropriate for some but not all patients with atrial fibrillation. The decision to use an anticoagulant is based on clinical judgement and individual patient factors such as (but not limited to) the risk of stroke, risk of bleeding, other medical conditions (co morbidities) and a patient's lifestyle factors such as risk of trauma from falls and compliance to treatments.                               The Government has recently commissioned a review of oral anticoagulation therapies in the management of atrial fibrillation to be conducted by Emeritus Professor Lloyd Sansom who will be supported by an expert Reference Group. The terms of reference for this review are:                              (a) To report on current and future options for improving the health outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulants.                              (b) To report on modes of health system delivery which may be used to optimise the use of currently available anticoagulants.                               (c) To report to what extent optimisation of the use of currently available anticoagulant treatments used in patients with atrial fibrillation would improve health outcomes and at what cost.                              (d) To examine the future role of newer anticoagulant therapies for atrial fibrillation.                              (e) To report on any other matter relevant to items a to d above and on any other matters referred to it by the Minister.                              The report from the review will incorporate the most recent literature, feedback from stakeholder consultation and advice from clinical experts and consumers currently involved in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation and associated stroke. It is anticipated that the report will be completed in 2012.              </DOC>

                              (1) When fraud is detected during processing of a Prospective Marriage visa application, it is recorded on file and in electronic case notes. This information however, is not recorded in a fashion which allows for statistical reporting. The Department is therefore unable to report on the number of Prospective Marriage visa applications refused on the basis of having provided bogus documents or incorrect information. Legislation allows for a visa to be cancelled if it is found that incorrect information or bogus documents were provided as part of the visa application.                               Since 2006, no Prospective Marriage visas have been cancelled on these grounds.               </DOC>

                              (1) and  (2) (a) The table below shows the number of Prospective Marriage visa holders who were under the age of 18 when they were granted the visa (1) who married their sponsor and lodged a Partner visa application onshore, (2) who did not marry their sponsor, did not enter Australia or departed Australia without lodging a Partner visa application, (3) who have not yet lodged a Partner visa and still lawfully hold a Prospective Marriage visa, and (4) who applied for other visas1.                              * Includes the 3 Family Violence claim cases referred to in (3b). Family Violence claims may only be made once the Prospective Marriage visa holder has married their sponsor and are assessed in the context of a Partner visa application.                               (2) (b) and (3) (a) Records indicate that since 2007, no Prospective Marriage visa holders in the under 18 category applied for a visa other than a Partner visa, including Protection visas.                               (3) (b) Three Prospective Marriage visa holders who were granted their visa when they were under the age of 18 applied for permanent residency under family violence provisions after they arrived in Australia.                               Of those three, one applicant met the family violence provisions for the grant of the Subclass 801 permanent visa. Another applicant was found not to meet the family violence provisions for the grant of the Subclass 801 visa. A decision has not yet been made in relation to the third case.                               ________________                                                1 The 'year' column refers to the year in which the visa holder applied for a partner visa in Australia or departed Australia, not the year the Prospective marriage visa was granted or the applicant entered Australia.              </DOC>

                              (1) and (2) Although evidence of registration will be held on file and recorded in case notes, the information cannot be recorded in a way which allows Departmental systems to report on the number of Partner visa applicants who have registered their relationship under a relevant law of a State or Territory on the basis of a same-sex relationship.                              Under Regulation 2.03A of the Migration Regulations 1994, couples who register their de facto relationship are not required to satisfy the twelve month relationship requirement that applies to other de facto relationships. The provision to allow de facto couples to register their relationship was introduced on 1 July 2009 as part of a package of measures to remove discrimination against same sex couples and their children. This provision does not undermine the integrity of the Partner visa program because visa applicants must still be assessed as being in a genuine relationship against the definition of de facto as per Section 5CB of the Migration Act 1958.                              (3) The table below shows the number of (non irregular maritime arrivals (IMA)) Protection visa applications received by the Department between 2006 and 2011 and their source countries. Most applicants arrived holding a valid visa. In 2010-11, only 27 raised a protection claim after arriving at an Australian airport without documentation.                              Protection visa application lodged by top 20 countries of citizenship (non-IMA)                              If it were provided, evidence of registration of a relationship would be held on file and recorded in case notes. The information could not be recorded in a way which allows Departmental systems to report on the number of Protection visa applicants who have registered their relationship under a relevant law of a State or Territory on the basis of a same-sex relationship.              </DOC>

                                              (1) and (2) The former Minister for Health and Ageing attended one meeting with the National Alliance for Action on Alcohol (NAAA) in November 2010, and attended one briefing event held by the NAAA in July 2011.  The current Minister for Health has not had any meetings with the NAAA.                              (3) (a) to (d) The Department does not commission specific research in relation to risks or benefits of alcohol consumption.                              Research on alcohol and other drugs is supported by the Department's funding to three National Drug Strategy Research Centres of Excellence who negotiate work plans and research directions with the Department on a triennial basis. The Centres work within the priorities of the National Drug Strategy 2010-2015, and provide and disseminate high-quality, rigorous research that contributes to evidence informed practice by health, law enforcement and education services. The Centres undertake work in a number of key priority areas including emerging trends, treatment, prevention, drug use and young people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and workforce development. The Centres also provide expert advice to Departmental officials, and officials of the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs, and its Standing Committees and Working Groups.                               (4) (a) to (e) Grants made to member organisations are set out in the attached table. The following points are relevant:                              (i) While many of the organisations are broad based public health organisations, only alcohol related grants have been identified;                              (ii) Where individual grants/projects focused solely on alcohol cannot be identified, total funding for the organisation is included; and                              (iii) Funding is allocated against each funded organisation rather than by any individual applicant, such as office bearers.                              * amount advised is core funding and covers both licit and illicit drug related activities.                                             </DOC>

                              (1) The Australian National Preventive Health Agency (ANPHA) was established to address the increasingly complex challenges associated with preventing chronic disease. It was established in response to the recommendations of the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission and the Preventative Health Taskforce, and with the support of the States and Territories through the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health (NPAPH).                              The recommendations of the Commission, the Taskforce and the decision of Governments under the NPAPH was that an agency solely focused on prevention and health promotion would play a valuable role, given the rapidly rising costs resulting from the growing burden of disease related to obesity, tobacco and harmful alcohol consumption.                              ANPHA has been established to bring national leadership and coordination to the efforts already underway throughout Australia, to forge strategic partnerships, and look at comprehensive approaches to disease prevention and health promotion, working across the lifespan (from early years to old age) and across sectors.                              ANPHA is fulfilling a range of functions that were not being given a specific focus previously, in particular:                              providing independent preventive health policy advice to the Commonwealth, State and Territory and local governments;                              establishing, for the first time, a National Preventive Health Research Strategy, and managing a grants program under that strategy;                              delivering a report on the state of preventive health in Australia;                              working with Medicare Locals to establish preventive health measures at the local level; and                              forming partnerships with industry, community and non-government sectors.                              These functions are in addition to the transfer of specific functions previously conducted by the Department of Health and Ageing to ANPHA and given a specific focus, in particular conducting social marketing campaigns relating to preventive health and the management of the National Binge Drinking Strategy.                              (2) Three members of the ANPHA Advisory Council were also members of the nine-member National Preventative Health Taskforce. Professor Rob Moodie chaired the Taskforce, Professor Mike Daube was deputy chair and Dr Lyn Roberts AM was a member of the Taskforce.                              (3) ANPHA does not have an Advisory Board. Biographical details for each of the members of the ANPHA Advisory Council may be found on ANPHA's website: www.anpha.gov.au                               (4) As at 3 November 2011, 13 staff of ANPHA have had experience working in the food industry (consisting of food handling, manufacture or retail sale). This comprised 39 per cent of ANPHA's 33 staff.              </DOC>

                              (1) The National Alliance for Action on Alcohol has more than 60 organisational members encompassing a broad range of non-government organisations, academic groups, health care providers, professional representative groups and alcohol and drug treatment centres. ANPHA has not had any meetings with NAAA as a stand-alone entity. ANPHA has however met on many occasions with many groups that are members of the NAAA on a range of public-health related issues, some alcohol-related, some not.                              (2) ANPHA is not doing any specific work on the health benefits of moderate alcohol consumption. Key result area 2.4 of ANPHA's strategic plan is to 'reduce the harmful consumption of alcohol' and states that the Agency will work to 'promote and support evidence-based approaches to address harmful alcohol consumption through strong polices and programs'.                               ANPHA is not working with NAAA on any such projects.              </DOC>

                              The number of corporate credit cards issued to departmental staff in Australia and the total value of transactions are as follows:                              (a) 2007-08: 212 cards and transactions of $3,418,187                              (b) 2008-09: 233 cards and transactions of $3,827,420                              (c) 2009-10: 263 cards and transactions of $4,035,134                              (d) 2010-11: 525 cards and transactions of $6,041,072*                              * The increase in cards issued and transactions in 2010-11 compared to 2009-10 is primarily due to a change in departmental policy on use of credit cards allowing certain travel expenses to be charged to the corporate card.                              Prior to receiving a departmental credit card staff are required to sign an undertaking that they understand the conditions governing the use of the card. The credit card payment process includes a third party review of all credit card transactions.                              Information on credit cards issued by the department's overseas offices is not maintained centrally. It would entail a significant diversion of resources to collate this information and, in these circumstances, I do not consider the additional work can be justified.              </DOC>

                              (i) and (ii) The total number of people claiming zone1 or overseas forces2 tax offsets on their returns and the estimated total cost to revenue of the offsets are:                              Total cost to revenue is the estimated amount of the zone or overseas forces tax offsets used to reduce tax payable. Data for the 2010-11 income year is not yet available as the lodgement period is still open. It is not possible to distinguish between the different zone or overseas forces tax offset categories, as all such offsets are claimed under the one category.                              (iii) and (iv) As per response to (i) and (ii).                              ____________                                                1 Broadly speaking, a zone tax offset is for people who live or work in certain remote or isolated areas. These remote areas are called zone A and zone B. There are also special areas within these zones.                                                 2 An overseas forces tax offset is for people who:                               served in a specified overseas locality as a member of the Australian Defence Force or a United Nations Armed Force in the last financial year; and                              income relating to that service was not specifically exempt from tax.              </DOC>

                              (1) Defence does not categorise civilians and Australian Defence Force members differently when booking travel and is therefore unable to provide a breakdown of these categories. The proportion of exemption reporting codes used between 1 July 2010 and 31 October 2011 are as follows (based on a total of 378,472 tickets - 353,240 domestic and 25,232 international).                                                             (2) Defence does not categorise civilians and Australian Defence Force members differently when booking travel and is therefore unable to provide a breakdown of these categories. The table below outlines the number and proportion (as a percentage) of flights booked with domestic (total 675,543 flights) and international (total 72,753 flights) airlines.                                                                                             (3) Under Whole-of-Australian Government arrangements all domestic and international airlines were invited to provide pricing on the basis of providing services to Whole-of-Australian Government. Accordingly there is no way of identifying what price Defence would have achieved if we had contracted separately, and in turn identify what savings have come as a direct result of the Whole-of-Australian Government arrangements. However, data is showing that Defence travellers are adopting different travel practices, such as the use of more restricted fares, therefore lower unit costs for travel are being incurred.              </DOC>

                              Note: The response below assumes that this question is referring to payments totalling $4.96 million paid to ORC Australia Pty Ltd in 2010-11 to undertake survey work for Tourism Research Australia's International and National Visitor surveys (refer to The Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism Annual Report 2010-11, Appendix 4, page 210, Table 23 Advertising and Market Research).                              (a) The International Visitor Survey represents the most comprehensive source of information on international visitors to Australia. It has been operating since the early 1970s and is jointly funded by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.                              The National Visitor Survey (NVS) is Australia's primary measure of domestic tourism activity, being the major source of information on the characteristics and travel patterns of domestic tourists. It has been operating since 1999 when it replaced the then Domestic Tourism Monitor (DTM). It is jointly funded by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.                              (b) The reports are published quarterly and posted on Tourism Research Australia's (TRA) website; they provide statistics on travel patterns and behaviour, there are no direct recommendations made in the reports.                              (c) The International Visitor Survey samples 40,000 departing, short-term international travellers over the age of 15 years who have been visiting Australia. The survey is conducted by Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) in the departure lounges of the eight major international airports; Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Cairns, Perth, Adelaide, Darwin and the Gold Coast.                              The National Visitor Survey is conducted with approximately 120,000 Australian residents aged 15 years and over on an annual basis. Respondents are interviewed in their homes using random digit dialling and a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing system.                              (d) (i) The IVS and NVS are the most comprehensive national tourism surveys and measure the economic value of tourism to the economy through the collection of expenditure data. The surveys also provide detailed data on other variables including travel patterns and social and demographics as well as other characteristics of visitation in Australia. The surveys provide information to government, industry, academic institutions and the public. The surveys are jointly funded by the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments.                              (ii) Opinion Research (ORC) has been engaged to undertake this survey work through a merit based tender process. ORC won the right to undertake the foreign language field work component of the International Visitor Survey in 2004. In 2005, ORC successfully tendered for the right to conduct all field work components of the IVS. In 2006, ORC won the right to conduct the field work components of the NVS.                              (e) The reports are published quarterly and posted on the TRA website. The most recent international report titled 'International Visitors in Australia  -  September 2011' was released on the 7th of December 2011. The most recent domestic travel report titled 'Travel by Australian  -  September 2011' was released on the 14th of December 2011.                              (f) The surveys are ongoing with interviews conducted daily, with the results compiled and published quarterly.                               (g) The full reports are made public each quarter, the most recent international report was released on the 7th of December 2011 and the most recent domestic report on the 14th of December 2011.              </DOC>

                              (a) Advice from the Queensland Reconstruction Authority is that the construction of the northbound section of the A J Wyllie Bridge will cost $20.35 million.                              (b) Under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, the Australian Government will contribute up to 75 per cent to the recovery and reconstruction costs associated with the floods of summer 2010-11. Advance payments totalling  $2.26 billion were made to Queensland in the 2010-11 financial year with further advance payments of $0.5 billion and $1.4 billion in the 2011-12 financial year. By the end of 2011-12, the Australian Government will have made advance payments of $4.16 billion to Queensland. Prioritising reconstruction projects is the responsibility of the Queensland Government.                              Advice from the Queensland Reconstruction Authority is that:                              (c) The tender went to market on 28 October 2011. The contract is expected to be awarded in February 2012.                              (d) Construction is due to be completed in late 2012 and the new bridge open to two lanes of traffic. Currently the southbound bridge is open with one lane of traffic in each direction.                              (e) The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR) is working with the Queensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation (DEEDI) to respond to concerns raised by businesses. DEEDI runs workshops and programs for businesses affected by natural disasters. DTMR is also working to ensure efficient traffic flow whilst maintaining a safe environment for motorists and pedestrians with a number of measures including variable message signs, changed timings of traffic signals and installing closed circuit television cameras.                              (f) Pedestrian and cyclist access across the northbound bridge will be maintained until demolition, with a temporary pedestrian and cycling bridge mounted onto the downstream side of the southbound bridge. To ensure safety, pedestrian signals will be installed south of Leis Parade. At the northern end, pedestrians will be able to cross at the existing traffic signal at the Wyllie Park access. Local businesses and the community can subscribe for SMS updates about A J Wyllie Bridge by visiting www.northpinebridgesms.com.au.                              (g) The construction timeframe of one year is reasonable considering works will involve demolition of the existing northbound bridge, construction of the new bridge and a number of complementary activities including the relocation of services such as major sewer pipes and water mains.              </DOC>

                              (a) At 30 June 2008, 958 corporate credit cards were issued to departmental staff. The total value of payments made on corporate credit card in 2007-08 was $7,235,479.25.                              (b) At 30 June 2009, 962 corporate credit cards were issued to departmental staff. The total value of payments made on corporate credit card in 2008-09 was $6,994,877.54.                              (c) At 30 June 2010, 928 corporate credit cards were issued to departmental staff.

                              (1) Generally an announcement is made or a press release issued for business cases which are rejected or where conditions are imposed.                              (2) I approved this proposal subject to a number of undertakings which Cargill provided addressing issues that had been raised during the examination of the proposal.                               Further information on the proposal and the undertakings can be found at:                              http://www.cargill.com.au/australia/en/news/NA3044313.jsp                              (3) The ACCC conducted an extensive public review of the proposed acquisition and concluded that it would be unlikely to substantially lessen competition in any of the relevant markets in breach of section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (see media release dated 17 March 2011 on the ACCC website).                              (4) In relation to Australian flour mills, the ACCC found that the acquisition by Cargill of AWB did not alter the existing ownership structure as AWB was not involved in flour milling (although AWB was a supplier of wheat to flour mills). The ACCC concluded that the removal of AWB as a supplier of wheat to Australian flour mills would not substantially lessen competition as flour mills have many alternative sources of grain supply.                              (5) Both foreign and domestic investment proposals which the ACCC has identified as potentially raising competition concerns will undergo review to assess the impact on competition. The processes for assessing acquisitions under section 50 that involve foreign firms is the same as it would be for a domestic firm - the test is whether the acquisition would be likely to substantially lessen competition in a market based on a forward looking assessment. Competition is also one of the factors taken into account in assessing national interest considerations under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 and Australia's foreign investment policy.                              (6) The proposal was reviewed by both the ACCC and the Foreign Investment Review Board.              </DOC>

                              The Department of Immigration and Citizenship accommodates families and unaccompanied minors in motel-style facilities because this is more appropriate than a detention centre. An increasing number of families and unaccompanied minors are now being accommodated in community detention, reducing the need for motel-style facilities.                              During the 2011 calendar year the cost of accommodating Irregular Maritime Arrivals in Alternative Places of Detention  -  which includes motel-style accommodation - averaged $3.473 million per month.                              During 2011, the following motel style accommodation facilities were closed:                              Asti on 30 June 2011                              Virginia Palms on 30 June 2011                              Jandakot on 21 October 2011                              The Darwin Airport Lodge was also expanded during this time.              </DOC>

                              (1), (3) and (4) The Government is not imposing any additional GST liabilities on developers of retirement villages.  Rather, the Commissioner of Taxation issued a public ruling clarifying that the value of all benefits  -  not just the cash amount  -  obtained by a vendor as a result of a sale of a retirement village is subject to GST.  The rate of GST, which applies to all taxable supplies, is 10 per cent of the value of the supply.                              (2) The increase in GST revenue collections arising from the Commissioner of Taxation's ruling was estimated.  The modelling undertaken does not take into account any wider impact on the economy.                              (5) No.                              (6) No. However, under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations, all of the revenue from the GST goes to the States and Territories.              </DOC>

                              The Local Adaptation Pathways Program and the Coastal Adaptation Decision Pathways projects provided grant funding to local governments to assist with adaptation planning for climate change. The guidelines for each program required that expert consultants be engaged to assist with the project work. The guidelines did not specify the proportion of funding to be used for this purpose.                               Information concerning the grant funding provided under the Local Adaptation Pathways Program can be found at www.climatechange.gov.au/government/initiatives/lapp.aspx.

The role of AFP members at airports is to deliver a sustainable, efficient and effective law enforcement capability focused on deterring and responding to acts of terrorism, the provision of uniformed policing and the investigation of serious and organised crime in the aviation stream.                                                                   Table 1: Number of Australian Federal Police staff deployed at each of Australia                  '                  s international airports                                              N.B. The above data excludes Hobart Airport and Alice Springs Airport which are not designated International Airports.                                                                                                 Table 2: Cost of Officers to the Australian Government                                                                                                                 Explanatory Notes:                                              All data is actuals as per cost centre reports from SAP Financial System.                              Costs attributed to officers (staff) include the following expense categories:                              Employee, Communications, Motor Vehicle, Staff, Operational Costs, Training, Travel, Sponsored Activity, Security (including Aviation Security Identification Card access).                              Full-time equivalent data as at 31 October 2011 includes AFP full-time equivalent and Supplier paid State Airport Uniform Police secondees.                              The above data includes Uniformed Police which are comprised of Airport Police Commanders, Officer in Charge, Police Aviation Liaison Officers, Team Leaders and Team Members.                              For 2007-08, Perth and Sydney costs were higher because there was a larger contingent of State Police.                              The above data excludes costs attributed to Headquarters staff, Aviation Security Officers and Enhanced and National Canine members.              </DOC>

                                                A review of Commonwealth subordinate legislation created before January 2008 conducted by the Department of Finance and Deregulation on behalf of the Government identified redundant and potentially redundant subordinate legislation. Attachment A provides details of the advice I have received from portfolio Ministers regarding progress by agencies in reviewing subordinate legislation that was identified by the review as potentially redundant and the repeal of redundant instruments. Attachment A:                                                                                                 Attachment A                                                                                            </DOC>

                              Departmental systems do not record this level of detail and the preparation of this answer would involve interrogation of information provided by each client. This would be a significant diversion of departmental resources and it is not considered that the additional work can be justified.              </DOC>

                              (1) Under the Australian Government's Clean Energy Future Plan, an equivalent carbon price will apply to synthetic greenhouse gases from 1 July 2012. This will be implemented through the Ozone and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989.                              The existing cost recovery levy of $165 per tonne on refrigerant gas will continue to apply to all importers of these gases (in bulk or contained in products and equipment) and is not being replaced by a flat levy of $30,065 per tonne, as suggested in the question. However, the total levy payable will be proportional to the global warming potential (GWP) of the relevant refrigerant gas.                               An analysis conducted by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency shows that the impact of the new arrangement on consumers is expected to be low as the amount of these gases in consumer products is generally small, making the refrigerant gas content only a small part of the overall cost of the product. For example, the price of a domestic refrigerator would increase by around $4 and the price of a new car would increase by around $18 due to the refrigerant gas contained in the air conditioner (if the full amount of the equivalent carbon price is passed on to consumers).                              The Government's household assistance package takes these impacts into account and ensures that two in three households will get tax cuts or increased payments that cover their expected average price impact of both this measure and the other elements of the carbon price.                              (2) It is important to note that there is a range of equipment in Australia using a variety of refrigerants other than synthetic gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are banned under the Montreal Protocol, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The alternative refrigerants include carbon dioxide, ammonia and hydrocarbons which are known as natural refrigerants. Available also is HFO-1234yf, which is a new synthetic refrigerant with a low GWP of 4, highly comparable to the hydrocarbons. Uptake of lower GWP refrigerant gases is what the new policy is designed to achieve.                              According to the United Nations Environmental Program, equipment using low-GWP alternatives can achieve equal or superior energy efficiency in a number of sectors, such as domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration and some types of air conditioning systems. In the case of industrial refrigeration, for example, hydrocarbon and ammonia systems are typically 10 to 30 per cent more energy efficient than conventional high-GWP HFC systems.              </DOC>

                              In respect of the GP Super Clinic being constructed in Portland, Victoria:                              (a) The Otway Division of General Practice, which represents local general practitioners, has been an active participant in the development of the Portland GP Super Clinic.                              (b) The Government's funding allocation for the Portland GP Super Clinic is $4.9 million (GST exclusive). Any information provided by Portland District Health (the organisation) in relation to the funding allocation for the Portland GP Super Clinic relates to the business affairs of that organisation and its provision would be likely to damage the commercial interests of individuals or the organisation.                              (c) (i) to (ii) The current expenditure information requested relates to the business affairs of the organisation and its provision would be likely to damage the commercial interests of individuals or the organisation.                              (d) The Portland GP Super Clinic is expected to open around early 2012.              </DOC>

                               The number of corporate credit cards issued to departmental staff varies from day-to-day due to staff movements, machinery of government changes, cards no longer being required and new cards being issued on a business needs basis. Changes in numbers are also occasioned throughout the year by the issue of replacement cards on expiration date. To provide an accurate comparison across financial years, 30 June was used as a point in time to determine the number of active corporate credit cards and the financial year expenditure.                               (a) As at 30 June 2008, my Department had 951 active credit cards.                              (b) As at 30 June 2009, my Department had 1012 active credit cards.                              (c) As at 30 June 2010, my Department had 1078 active credit cards.                              (i) All corporate credit cards were issued to departmental staff.                              (ii) The total cost of all transactions made on these corporate credit cards as at 30 June was:                                             </DOC>

                              The 2008 Government report Australia's low pollution future: the economics of climate change mitigation provided details of modelling of the effect of a carbon price on the economy. One of the scenarios modelled in that report, labelled 'CPRS-5', incorporated information from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Green Paper and was calibrated to achieve a carbon mitigation target of 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020 and 60 per cent below 2000 levels by 2050.                              In 2011, the Government report Strong growth low pollution: modelling a carbon price was released and the core policy scenario contained in that modelling report closely matched the Government's policy as outlined in the Clean Energy Future.                              The responses to your questions regarding the 2011 report are:                              (a) Australia's GDP in 2010 is estimated to be $1.28 trillion (2010 dollars).                              (b) The forecasts of GDP and GDP per capita average growth rate per annum between 2010 and 2050 are 2.7 and 1.4 per cent respectively for the medium global action scenario. GDP in 2050 is estimated to be $3.66 trillion (2010 dollars).                              (c) The forecasts of GDP and GDP per capita average growth rate per annum between 2010 and 2050 is 2.6 and 1.3 per cent respectively for the core policy scenario. GDP is estimated to be $3.56 trillion (2010 dollars) in 2050.                              (d) This information is published in Chart 5.13 in the SGLP report, available on the Treasury website.                                                                            </DOC>

                              (1) No, the ATO has not implemented a new regulatory policy under which it will be conducting 'real time' audits on Australia's top 200 companies, thereby moving away from the long-standing policy of self-assessment and post lodgement audit.                               The Commissioner's compliance program, which consists of a range of products, is implemented using the Commissioner's general powers of administration. The Commissioner's 'real time'' initiative, which does not change the policy of self assessment in the large business market, is one of these products.                              In considering which businesses may need to be reviewed, and the frequency and intensity of that review, the ATO considers the relative likelihood of a large business taxpayer having a contentious position and the consequences of that potential non-compliance.                               Using this intelligence the ATO categorises large businesses into one of four broad risk categories, each of which has a suggested compliance approach. The ATO calls this process risk differentiation.                              For higher risk taxpayers in the large market, this 'real time' work is in the form of a 'risk review', not an 'audit'. The distinction is that a risk review only identifies whether there may be a contentious tax issue, while an audit seeks to gather the evidence necessary for an adjustment and possible litigation.                               The majority of large businesses in the risk differentiation framework are categorised as relatively lower risk and will be receiving notification from the Commissioner that their affairs for that year will not be further reviewed unless evidence of a material misstatement comes to his attention. This provides certainty to the large businesses.                              Alerting taxpayers to the ATO view of their relative risk allows large business to make better informed self-assessment choices about potentially contentious arrangements and how they engage with the ATO as the regulator of the system.                               As set out in the ATO Large Business and Tax Compliance booklet, the ATO Risk Differentiation Framework (RDF) assists the ATO to prioritise and focus on those few taxpayers, less than 2 per cent - that is less than 20 businesses, that in its professional judgment present a higher level of relative risk to the integrity of the tax system. A further 8 per cent or so are categorised as key taxpayers  -  these are the largest businesses in the tax system and pay most of the tax.                               (2) The Australian Government Best Practice Regulation Handbook (June 2010) states:                               2.7 A RIS is mandatory for all decisions made by the Australian Government and its agencies that are likely to have a regulatory impact on business or the not-for-profit sector, unless that impact is of a minor or machinery nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. This includes amendments to existing regulation and the rolling over of sunsetting regulation.                              However, the Prime Minister has discretion to grant exceptional circumstances to exempt a proposal from the RIS requirements.                               The Handbook also states:                               2.42 Where a proposal proceeds (either through the Cabinet or another decision maker) without an adequate RIS, the resulting regulation must be the subject of a post-implementation review (PIR). The review must commence within one to two years of the regulation being implemented, and will be required regardless of whether or not an exemption from the RIS requirements for exceptional circumstances was granted by the Prime Minister.                               (3) The Commissioner's 'real time' initiative is administrative in nature with no new tax regulations being introduced. On that basis OBPR were not consulted.                               (4) There has been no change to the tax regulations. Therefore a regulatory impact statement was not required.                               (5) The Commissioner did not communicate with OBPR as the 'real time' initiative is administrative in nature.                               The Commissioner communicates with the large business market using a range of channels, including the Large Business and Tax Compliance booklet which was co-designed with representatives of the Large Business Advisory Group. The booklet comprehensively outlines the Commissioner's approach to tax compliance issues, including risk differentiation and various compliance products.                               (6) The Commissioner's initiative is administrative in nature with no new tax regulations being introduced. The approach was piloted with a number of higher risk taxpayers.                              (7) There is no additional cost to Government anticipated. The Commissioner funds the majority of compliance activities from the general ATO budget. The ATO believes that early real time engagement can save both business and the ATO time and money. By working with the large business market to identify areas of possible contention as early as is practical, taxpayers can then make more informed self-assessment decisions in regard to those matters.                               (8) The OBPR is not aware of the specific US Internal Revenue Service program. The OBPR does not determine what policies or approaches should be adopted by the Government. The OBPR's role is to administer the Government's regulatory impact assessment requirements (outlined in the Best Practice Regulation Handbook (June 2010) and Council of Australian Governments Guide to Best Practice Regulation (October 2007).              </DOC>

                              My Department has advised me that the International Energy Agency's (IEA's) World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2011 estimates that global conventional oil production will move from 70.4 million barrels/day (mb/d) in 2008 to plateau at around 69 mb/d for a number of years and move to 68 mb/d by 2035.                               The IEA maintains that production of natural gas liquids and unconventional oil will continue to grow strongly and therefore total global oil production is not expected to peak before the end of the WEO forecast period, which goes out to 2035.               </DOC>

                              (1) The Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) was abolished as a budget savings measure to fund rebuilding after the floods. There are significant cost savings generated by continuing the work of the ALTC within DEEWR with staff costs less than half of what was incurred by the ALTC. These savings occur because DEEWR already has areas of support in place, such as IT and human resources, which do not need to be duplicated.                               The ALTC was established in 2004, at a time when funding for university teaching was significantly lower than it is today. The Government is investing $35.7 billion over the next four years in teaching and learning in our universities to drive greater participation and improve access and equity. This will be supported by new regulatory and quality arrangements to be funded through the $1.1 billion Advancing Quality in Higher Education initiative announced in the last Budget. The suite of quality initiatives includes: the establishment of the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), which will carry out regulatory functions from January 2012; Reward Funding for achieving performance targets for participation of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and other underrepresented groups; the Structural Adjustment Fund to assist universities adjust to the new operational requirements of a demand driven funding system; and the My University website which will improve transparency and inform choice.                               (2) Quality teaching and learning will continue to be a high priority for the Government as the sector moves towards a demand driven environment and student numbers expand.  TEQSA's primary task will be to ensure that students receive a high quality education at any of Australia's higher education providers. It will register providers, accredit courses for those institutions without the authority to self-accredit, carry out evaluations of standards and performance, streamline current regulatory arrangements and protect and assure the quality of international education.                              The Office for Learning and Teaching will promote and support excellence in learning and teaching in higher education institutions with funding of $50 million over four years for a Grants and Awards Program. The Office will be guided by a Strategic Advisory Committee to ensure the ongoing involvement of the higher education sector.                               The Office's responsibilities include:                              providing grants to academics and professional staff to explore, develop and implement innovations in learning and teaching and to develop leadership capabilities                              commissioning work on issues of strategic significance to the higher education sector to inform policy development and practice in relation to learning and teaching                               managing a suite of awards to celebrate, recognise and value teaching excellence and programs that enhance student learning                              funding fellowships and secondments for leading educators to address significant national educational issues                              disseminating resources on innovations in learning and teaching                               supporting the development of effective mechanisms for the embedding of good practice in learning and teaching in Australian higher education                              encouraging collaboration and sharing of good practice for improved student learning outcomes                              facilitating networking and professional development opportunities for academics and professional staff.              </DOC>

                                              Funding for the GP Super Clinics Program was first made available in the May 2008 Budget. Funding Agreements could not be entered into prior to this time.                                                The original Practical Completion dates in Funding Agreements are indicative only                  .                   It is recognised that these will vary over time as they are heavily dependent on external factors beyond the control of the funding recipient including                   the availability of land/suitable premises for the clinic, local council planning and approval processes, availability of construction workforce and materials, and weather conditions                  .                   The size and complexity of the construction project can also impact on the anticipated project timeframe.                                                                                  The Department monitors the Funding Agreements for each GP Super Clinic and negotiates variations to milestone timeframes, if required, to reflect the impact of these external influences.

                              (1) Airservices Australia (Airservices) has advised that the installation of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) is based on whether an airport is strongly impacted by weather conditions that affect visibility conditions when navigating the runway.                               (2) and (3) Airservices funds the installation of an ILS.                               (4) Airservices has an agreement in place with the Gold Coast Airport to progress the installation of an ILS at the airport. Airservices will be working collaboratively with the airport and other key stakeholders to progress this initiative.                                                                             </DOC>

                              On 3 December 2007, the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism (RET) was formed out of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources (DITR). RET falls within the portfolio of the Minister for Resources and Energy, and the Minister for Tourism.                               The Australia Solar Institute (ASI) was incorporated as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee on 10 August 2009, and falls with the purview of the Minister for Resources and Energy.                              As at 31 December 2011, the full-time equivalent (FTE) employees for:                              RET was 565.81 (excluding the Secretary).                              ASI was 8 (including the Executive Director).                              Legislation passed the Parliament in 2011 to create the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). This entity commences operation on 1 July 2012.              </DOC>

                              Eight agencies have been created within the portfolio since 24 November 2007. The names of each entity and the number of fulltime equivalent employees each entity had at the end of 2011 are provided in the table below.                                                             The definition used for Full Time Equivalent (FTE) is as follows:                              FTE is calculated based on the number of hours worked by a staff member in a given reporting period, usually calendar months.  Paid leave (either full or half-pay) taken by staff does not affect the FTE calculations.  Unpaid leave taken by staff reduces the FTE as the total number of hours worked in the period reduces.                                                                            </DOC>

                              (1) The target audience comprises:                              (a) decision-makers;                              (b) emerging middle class;                               (c) young aspirants;                              (d) students; and                              (e) regional nationals who are Australian alumni.                              DFAT selected the target audience as the demographic sectors which would most likely form a dedicated and influential viewership, and achieve the overarching Commonwealth Objectives for the service, in particular the Objective of 'providing a credible, impartial and independent voice, delivered to an international audience via innovative as well as conventional multimedia platforms'. The selected target audience are also the priority demographic sectors to attract to viewership of Australia Network in terms of the Commonwealth's Objectives to:                              promote an image of Australia as a dynamic and culturally diverse nation of the Asia-Pacific region and raise awareness of Australia's strengths and achievements across a range of fields;                              present Australian perspectives on the world and foster public understanding of Australia's global and regional role; and                              increase awareness of the close links between Australia and the Asia-Pacific region.                              (2) In accordance with the previous contract dated 4 August 2006 ('ABC Contract'), DFAT undertook a review of the performance of the ABC, including its reach to the target audience, in June 2010                              the Network was available at that time in 31 million homes across 45 markets, through 640 rebroadcast partners (up from 460 in 2009).                              This information was sourced from surveys Australia Network has subscribed to (as required under the terms of the ABC Contract). These surveys measure 'elite' viewership across markets (the target audience).                              (3) Yes                              The ABC contract set out detailed performance standards which were reported on annually and addressed the reach and appeal of the service, and the quality, relevance and credibility of programming, including of news, current affairs and business programs                              the ABC Contract also required DFAT to undertake a detailed review of the performance of the ABC after three years of the term of the contract                              this review was completed in June 2010.                              (4) Television remains a key medium. DFAT anticipates that the rapid evolution of digital media services and technologies will continue. The Statement of Requirement, which formed part of the Request For Tender, therefore emphasised the Government's expectation of a modern up-to-date service, which is not limited to television, and which keeps pace with technological developments over the life of the contract.                              The Statement of Requirement anticipated that greater efficiency and effectiveness would be delivered through increasing the Australia Network's online presence, increased use of social media and employment of new digital media technologies as alternative means to the television service of providing audio-visual content to target audiences.              </DOC>

                              (1) There are 19 towns in the remote central and eastern Australia licence area in the Commonwealth electorate of Maranoa that receive television via analog retransmission. Of these towns, five are council funded self-help  retransmission sites (Adavale, Eromanga, Eulo, Wyandra and Yowah).                               (2) It is not the Australian government's policy to provide digital television retransmission services at remote analog self-help sites. The Department has not assessed the cost of conversion to digital at these sites. This would require a competitive tender process approved for this purpose. Factors that would need to be taken into account at each site include the range and extent of capital works required and the ongoing maintenance costs involved.                              Minister Conroy informed Councils in March 2010 that local councils who wish to pursue a retransmission option must do so at their own expense. This includes costs associated with going to market to attract potential tenderers or costs incurred in seeking independent commercial advice about the provision of the necessary services.               </DOC>

                              The first release sites for the NBN were chosen and designed to test the variety of locations and operational conditions likely to be encountered in the overall rollout of the NBN.                               The pattern of connection methodologies employed was varied to enable an assessment of performance in these trials. The lessons from these trials are now being incorporated in the design of the volume rollout. Accordingly, the particular characteristics of these trials cannot be considered indicative of the likely experience in the rollout overall.               </DOC>

                               The power consumed by NBN Co's fibre network termination device (NTD) depends upon the services being utilised at the time. The average power consumed by an indoor type fibre NTD serving one 100 Mbps data service and one PS TN -equivalent UNI -V service which is utilised 10% of the time is approximately 6.8 Watt.                               In comparison the measured average power consumption of a DECT cordless phone on its base station (a Panasonic Range 900) was 6.1 Watt, with the telephone line idle, no calls in progress, and the cordless phone resting in its cradle. In addition, the average power consumption of a personal computer varies from approximately 30 Watt for a laptop to between 200 and 1000 Watt for desktops, including the monitor. A connected ADSL modem to the computer has been measured at 7.2 Watt.              </DOC>

                              The table below provides details of NBN Co Limited's leased assets and the proportion of leased assets versus owned assets as of 29 February 2012:                                                             Notes:                              Leased assets relate to both operating and finance lease arrangements as defined under Australia Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standard 117.                              Estimated market value is predominantly based on a return of rental formula, rather than a formal valuation.                              The lease value disclosed relates to the initial contractual term of the agreement, not the financial result as at 29 February 2012.                              Leases of property are the most common arrangements as at 29 February 2012.                              Licences have been excluded from these results.              </DOC>

                              The Australian Government does not accept the findings of Dr Ferenc Miskolczi on the Saturated Greenhouse Effect Theory.                              The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has reviewed Dr Miskolczi's findings that the Earth's greenhouse effect is constant, is naturally controlled by a balance between water vapour and other greenhouse gases, and that currently accepted rules significantly overestimate the sensitivity of greenhouse forcing.                              Dr Miskolczi's findings have not been published in a mainstream science journal that is open to the process of peer-review.                              The Government has not directed the CSIRO to investigate the Saturated Greenhouse Effect Theory.                              There is clear evidence that our climate is changing, largely due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. The Fourth Assessment Report, produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007, states global warming is 'unequivocal' and 'most of the observed increase in globally-averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in greenhouse gas concentrations'.                              There are multiple lines of evidence in the report showing that the Earth's climate system is warming. These include increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level. The report represents the international consensus on climate change science in literature that has been extensively peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals. The report can be found at www.ipcc.ch.                              The findings of the IPCC have been strongly supported by recent publications that synthesise the peer reviewed literature including, the American National Academies (www.dels.nas.edu), the Royal Society in the United Kingdom (www.royalsociety.org) and the Australian Academy of Science (www.science.org.au).                              The consensus within the mainstream science community is that climate change is real, currently being observed and will have significant future impacts if no action is taken to reduce global carbon pollution.              </DOC>

                              The only agency in the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) Portfolio that has been created since 24 November 2007 is the National Mental Health Commission (NMHC). The NMHC was established on 1 January 2012 as an executive agency. As the entity was not established until 2012, the entity did not have any full-time equivalent employees to report at the end of 2011.                              The Department of Climate Change and its related entity, the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator, were established in the PM&amp;C Portfolio on 3 December 2007. The department has since been renamed the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and both agencies transferred to a separate portfolio, the Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Portfolio, on 8 March 2010. As this department is not part of the Prime Minister's Portfolio, questions regarding staffing levels at the end of 2011 should be addressed to the relevant Portfolio Minister.                              The Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government was established in the PM&amp;C Portfolio on 14 September 2010. The department has since been renamed the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport and transferred to a separate portfolio, the Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport Portfolio, on 14 December 2011. As this department is not part of the Prime Minister's Portfolio, questions regarding staffing levels at the end of 2011 should be addressed to the relevant Portfolio Minister.                              The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner was established in the PM&amp;C Portfolio on 1 November 2010. The agency has since transferred to the  Attorney-General's Portfolio on 19 October 2011. As this agency is not part of the Prime Minister's Portfolio, questions regarding staffing levels at the end of 2011 should be addressed to the relevant Portfolio Minister.              </DOC>

                              The Australian Government's strategic study on the implementation of the High Speed Rail network on the east of Australia between Brisbane and Melbourne is well underway. The first phase of the study, released, on 4 August 2011, showed that constructing an eastern seaboard network connecting Brisbane to Melbourne via Sydney and Canberra would cost between $61 billion and $108 billion in $2011. On the basis of population forecasts, assumed fares and operational characteristics, up to 54 million passengers could be using the high speed rail by 2036. The full phase one report is available at &lt;http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/rail/trains/high_speed/&gt;.                              Phase two of the study is currently in progress and due for completion at the end of 2012. It will analyse the phase one findings in much greater detail and will identify a preferred corridor alignment and station locations, including regional stations. It will also refine cost estimates, passenger and revenue forecasts, assess financial and economic viability and provide options for staging, financing and governance.                               My Department has not received a submission from the community of Taree regarding a dedicated high speed rail station.              </DOC>

                              I recently released a work schedule for the full completion of the Pacific Highway developed by my Department in consultation with the NSW Roads and Maritime Services (NSW RMS) at Attachment A.                               An estimate provided by the NSW RMS in late 2011 indicated that the cost to duplicate the remaining sections of the Pacific Highway is in the vicinity of $7 billion. Individual project estimates are being prepared using the Australian Government Best Practice Cost Estimation Standards. These estimates will be refined and further developed as the planning, environmental and geotechnical works progress on the remaining unduplicated sections of the Pacific Highway.

                              (1) Planning and construction of the NBN is well underway including in the Wide Bay electorate. Indicative coverage maps published by NBN Co suggest that Cooran, Cooroy, Goomeri, Gympie, Maryborough, Murgon, Pomona, Rainbow Beach and Tin Can Bay are likely to be served by fibre to the premises (FTTP) technology capable of providing speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second.                               Tiaro, Kilkivan, Imbil and Cherbourg are likely to be served by next-generation fixed wireless technology which will provide peak download speeds of 12 megabits per second. NBN Co expects higher speeds will become available as technologies improve. All remaining premises will be served by next-generation satellite technologies providing peak download speeds of 12 megabits per second. Current indicative coverage information for Queensland is available at www.nbnco.com.au/our-network. It is important to note that coverage information is indicative only and subject to change.                              (ii) Premises covered by the NBN fibre, fixed wireless and satellite technologies include residential and business premises as well as schools and hospitals.                              (iii) The precise optic fibre footprint will only be known when NBN Co completes its detailed region by region designs of the network.                              (iv) NBN Co will offer a free connection to the network when the NBN is rolled out in each suburb. This includes the standard installation of a network termination device (NTD) -  - the box which provides connection to the NBN -  - at the premises of all consenting customers. In some cases charges may apply for non-standard installations.                               (v) NBN Co is moving as quickly as practical to roll out the network, including to Wide Bay. However, consistent with any major project of this size and complexity, it is necessary that the planning and design phases are undertaken to ensure that the rollout occurs as efficiently as possible.                              As outlined in the 2011-2013 Corporate Plan NBN Co forecasts it will take approximately 9.5 years to build the NBN.                               NBN Co has not yet indicated dates for the fibre network rollout in the electorate of Wide Bay. However, on 18 October 2011 NBN Co released its first 12 month national rollout schedule. The schedule was subsequently updated on 15 February 2012 and will be further updated each quarter to include new locations. You can visit the NBN Co website at www.nbnco.com.au for more information on the network rollout.                              NBN Co plans to complete the rollout of its fixed-wireless network, including some communities in the Wide Bay electorate, by 2015.                              On 1 July 2011, NBN Co launched its Interim Satellite Service (ISS) which offers improved broadband services to homes and small businesses unable to access a metro-comparable broadband service, ahead of the introduction of a long term satellite service solution in 2015.              </DOC>

                              (a) Australia Post apologises for the disappointment and inconvenience caused by the loss of mail in the truck fire in December 2011. Parcels posted around 14 December 2011 from Western Australia to Queensland may have been impacted.                              Compensation is payable in accordance with the type of service chosen by the sender. For customers who chose services such as 'Registered Post' and/or                               'Extra Cover', Australia Post is offering compensation and a refund of postage.                               Customers who sent a parcel that may have been impacted by the fire can lodge their claims via the Australia Post website www.auspost.com.au, in person at a corporate post office or by calling its Customer Contact Centre (CCC) on 13 13 18.                              (b) Customers that used Australia Post products such as Express Post, Express Post Platinum, Registered Post and eParcel with transit cover may be entitled to compensation if proof of value and proof of posting can be provided.                               (c) All CCC staff have access to the same database that details information about the truck fire including which parcels may have been impacted and what customers need to do in order to lodge a claim for compensation.                                Australia Post is not aware of complaints about 'inconsistent information' and is more than happy to investigate any such complaints if Ms Marino is able to provide specific details.              </DOC>

                              The average Medicare benefits paid per capita (1) in Federal electoral divisions, based on patient Medicare enrolment postcodes for 2010 &amp; 2011, by year of processing of claims, is presented in the table below:                                                              NOTES:                               (1) Populations for Commonwealth Electoral Division (CED) are calculated on a financial year basis. The 2010 table uses the estimated resident population (ERP) at 30 June 2010. The ERP at 30 June 2011 is not yet available for Federal electoral divisions. Therefore the 2011 table also uses the ERP as at 30 June 2010.                               (2) Calendar year of processing is the year in which the claim was processed by Medicare Australia. For example, a service rendered by a Medicare provider to a patient in December 2009 and having the claim processed by Medicare in January 2010, will appear in 2010 data.                               (3) Only health services receiving a Medicare benefit appear in Medicare data sets.                               (4) In compiling Medicare statistics by state/territory, each postcode is usually allocated to only one state. In contrast, the electorate concordance file allocates fractions of particular postcodes across states. Some postcodes are not represented on the concordance file. As a consequence, data coverage for state/territory in electorate data, may differ slightly from the coverage of state/territory data reported elsewhere.                              (5) Medicare benefits have been allocated to electoral divisions on the basis of each patient's Medicare enrolment postcode at the time of service. Patients may change enrolment postcode in a period, and as a consequence have services in more than one electorate. Patients may also have changed their postcode of residence and not yet updated their Medicare enrolment postcode.                                Where possible, PO Box postcodes have been allocated to an electorate using geospatial programs and a PO Box/delivery area postcode file from Australia Post. Where a postcode boundary overlaps different electorate boundaries, the postcode data is allocated to the respective electorates using a postcode to CED concordance file, built by  the Department of Health and Ageing, using Australian Bureau of Statistics population data. This assumes that Medicare postcode data is geographically distributed in the same proportions as the population was distributed for these split postcodes. This may result in some postcode-based service and funding data being allocated to an electorate different to that of the address of the service provider or user.               </DOC>

                              The Australian Government has commissioned two studies relating to the financial challenges facing local government:                              The Department has commissioned Ernst &amp; Young to conduct an analysis of prioritisation and financing of local government infrastructure. Ernst &amp; Young is expected to deliver a final report for the Government's consideration in late April 2012.                              The Government is reviewing the equity and efficiency of the total current funding provided for local government through the Financial Assistance Grants program. The review is expected to be completed in 2012-13.              </DOC>

                              The Better Regulation Ministerial Partnership on Working Visa Simplification managed between the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and Department of Finance and Deregulation is being progressed.                              After the release of the initial Simpler Visas public discussion paper in June 2010, a second public discussion paper outlining proposals for Temporary Work visas was released in December 2010, and a third public discussion paper outlining proposals for Visitor visas was released in April 2011. All three public discussion papers are available on the Department's website.                              Following public response to the second and third papers my Department and I are considering final proposals for Temporary Work and Visitor visas.                              It is also proposed that simplification and deregulation outcomes will be delivered across the General Skilled Migration, Business Skills and Employer Nomination and Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme visa programs in conjunction with the proposed SkillSelect model reforms on 1 July 2012.               </DOC>

                              (1) To ensure the integrity of our migration and visa systems the department takes any allegation of migration fraud very seriously. The integrity of English language testing across program areas is important as English language results are a key component in certain visa application requirements.                              IELTS is an independent commercial enterprise and the department does not have a contract with IELTS or any agency contracted to conduct the IELTS test. Issues relating to identity/verification checks undertaken as part of IELTS testing are a matter for IDP International as administrators of the IELTS test.                               A Deed of Agreement for the provision of access to online test score verification services exists between the DIAC and IDP International English Language Test System (IELTS) Pty Ltd for the provision of English language test results for Student visa purposes. This agreement describes intellectual property rights, security arrangements, protection of personal information and described required services to enable the department to verify IELTS test score results.                               The Deed of Agreement also includes a number of integrity standards that IELTS is expected to conform to, including measures to minimise the risk of identity substitution and ensure appropriate document fraud prevention measures are in place.                              The department works closely with IDP International to ensure we are promptly notified of all fraud attempts and detection in relation to the IELTS test, and takes action as appropriate.                               Specification of English language tests accepted for the purposes of Australian visas is at the sole discretion of the Minister for Immigration of Citizenship. English language test providers are aware that their specification may be reviewed should they be found not to have robust practices in place to identify and address possible instances of fraud.                              (2) The department does not maintain statistical information at this level therefore is unable to provide this information.                               (3) The department does not maintain statistical information at this level therefore is unable to provide this information.                               (4) The department currently employs five facial image comparison specialists. In addition to the facial image comparison specialists, the department is developing four staff in-house as facial image comparison trainees.

                              (1) Eleven staff (equating to 8.09 full-time equivalent), including one manager and ten customer-service staff members are employed in the Department of Human Services (DHS) Service Centre offering Medicare services  in the Stirling Centre, Bunbury, WA.                              (2) The consolidation of the DHS service centres in Bunbury, which currently offer Medicare and Centrelink services in separate locations, is currently under consideration for co-location.                              (i) The consolidation of the service centres is being considered as part of the government's service delivery reform to significantly improve service delivery to customers, especially in key life stages such as bereavement, separation or birth of a new child. It would create a one-stop shop for Bunbury residents, allowing them to access all Medicare and Centrelink services in one location.                               (ii) The consolidation is under consideration. At this point, no timeframe has been decided.                              (iii) DHS experience of previous colocations is that customers value the change and support the integrated approach to service delivery. Consolidation of DHS services in any community is assessed carefully to ensure that customers continue to experience a high level of service and accessibility. Assessments include property and security considerations, and advice from local DHS staff who are aware of community preferences. The community is engaged through a range of channels to ensure they are aware of any changes to services in their community.                              (iv) If co-location occurred in Bunbury, the existing customer-service staff members would continue to provide Medicare services at the consolidated service centre.                               (v) Yes                              (vi) The provision of customer parking is a consideration of the property and accessibility assessment of all consolidating sites, to ensure that customers continue to enjoy convenient access to DHS services.              </DOC>

                              The decision to freeze redemptions is a commercial decision made by the individual fund and not a decision taken by Government. Funds are required under the law to freeze redemptions if they do not have sufficient liquid assets and cash reserves to be able to pay out redemption requests. It is important to note that funds, particularly mortgage funds, had been under liquidity pressure for some time before the announcement of the Government's deposit guarantee in October 2008, as a result of the property downturn and the general turmoil in financial markets.                               As its liquidity improves a fund can offer its members an equal opportunity to redeem some or all of their investments. In addition, funds can provide a special hardship measure to members in certain circumstances.              </DOC>

                              The Department of Defence's departmental guidelines state that 'an official must only use a Defence Credit Card to obtain cash, goods or services for official business of the Commonwealth'.                              The Department of Defence investigates all credit card misuse, including accidental and intentional. In all cases appropriate disciplinary action such as counselling, issuing fines or formal sanctions are undertaken. In a small number of cases the employee resigned before action could be taken. The Department of Defence attempts to recover all funds.                              Some data relating to debt recovery is unavailable, particularly in earlier years. This is due to a previous departmental process whereby the area undertaking the investigation, was not responsible for actual recovery. Since February 2011, the fraud recovery function has been centralised with Defence's Audit and Fraud Control Division. This new arrangement has seen an improvement in both the rate of recovery and the accuracy of recovery data.                              The controls and detection strategies applicable to card misuse are effective and are becoming increasingly so with evidence that card misuse is being detected faster, with the number and dollar value of individual cases decreasing over time.                              In 2008-09, the guidelines were breached 51 times, with a total value of $89,718.49.                                                              (1) Insufficient evidence to determine liability                              (2) Insufficient evidence to determine liability                              (3) Includes 2 instances of misuse committed by one individual                              (4) Includes 11 instances of misuse committed by one individual                              (5) Includes 15 instances of misuse committed by one individual                              (6) Includes 35 instances of misuse committed by one individual                              (7) Includes 9 instances of misuse committed by one individual                              (^) Information on amount recovered is unavailable                              In 2009-10, the guidelines were breached 83 times, with a total value of $32,314.85.                                                             (*) Total does not include foreign currency                              (^) Information on amount recovered is unavailable                              In 2010-11, the guidelines were breached 91 times, with a total value of $37,138.10.                                                             (1) Property obtained through credit card was recovered                              (2) Card was stolen                              (^) Information on amount recovered is unavailable              </DOC>

                              The Royal Australian Air Force was unable to support the flypast request for the commemorative service for the seventieth anniversary of the sinking of the HMAS Sydney (II) owing to the unavailability of aircraft in Western Australia at the time.  The request was considered by both Number 2 Flying Training School and Number 79 Squadron.  These two squadrons operate the only two aircraft types in Western Australia  -  the PC-9/A and the Hawk 127.                                Number 2 Flying Training School was extensively committed to the training of two pilot courses. There was no capacity to support other activities outside of course commitments.  To conduct rehearsals and the flypast would have impacted significantly on the flying training program.                              Number 79 Squadron aircraft availability at the time was limited due to engine maintenance issues.  A program had been put in place to conserve flying hours to allow the Squadron to continue to provide essential flying training and support to the operational priorities for Army and Navy.                              Use of an aircraft from an Air Force Base outside of Western Australia was also considered. At the time all other likely aircraft were tasked in support of Operation RESOLUTE and were located elsewhere. Given the significant costs involved in providing an aircraft for a single event, the decision was taken that a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft would not be provided.              </DOC>

                              Frontline staff within the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry are rotated in accordance with the Department's Regional Rotation Principles.                               There are no set periods for rotation. Rotation decisions are made at a regional level taking into account a range of factors such as operational requirements, the need for succession planning and the opportunity for staff development.                               For operational reasons, one staff member has worked in the freight/cargo operations area in the South East region for fifteen years, albeit in a number of different operational roles and work units over this period.              </DOC>

                                                 (1) Under the AusAID NGO Cooperation Program (ANCP) (which in 2011-12 provides funding of $98.1 million to 43 accredited Australian NGOs to undertake over 600 international development activities across approximately 50 countries), NGOs may use up to ten per cent of their funding to raise awareness of development issues within Australia. AusAID's guidelines (available at http://www.ausaid.gov.au/ngos/pdfs/ancp-awareness-raising-guidelines.pdf) restrict activities to those which meet at least one of three objectives, these are: promoting transparency in the use of public funds; enhancing development effectiveness; and increasing public understanding of development issues.                              Development awareness raising activities will not be supported if they include any form of fundraising, promote a particular religious adherence, build public support for increases in aid funding or lobbying for changes in aid policy, or mobilise members of the public to undertake advocacy in relation to the aid program.                               Of 43 eligible NGOs, there are 22 who have opted to use ANCP funding to engage in development awareness raising activities in 2011-12. The approximate portion of ANCP funding used for these activities is provided in the table below. AusAID has also provided separate funding of $317,200 to World Vision Australia in 2011-12 to conduct 'One Just World' public discussion forums.                                                             (2) AusAID funding to NGOs to undertake development awareness raising activities between 2008 and 2012 is as follows:                                                             (3) NGOs which receive grants under the ANCP are required to provide AusAID with annual financial and project plans and reports. Annual plans are required to outline objectives, outputs and targets for all activities, including development awareness activities in Australia. These are assessed against the objectives in AusAID's guidelines and are subject to approval before funding is granted.                                                                             </DOC>

                               (a) 2008-2009                              (i) There were 16 instances of non-compliance with departmental guidelines relating to the use of departmental credit cards for non-official purposes.                              (ii) The dollar amount of each instance is outlined in the table below. The full amount in each instance has been reimbursed to the Attorney-General's Department (the 'Department').                              (iii) All officers that were non-compliant were counselled on the proper use of the cards and their responsibilities as cardholders. 13 non-compliances involved accidental use of a departmental credit card. Three non-compliances involved the use of a departmental credit card to pay a single account that included both official and private expenditure. The Department has since amended its internal guidelines to permit the use of a departmental credit card for coincidental private expenditure which is permissible under Regulation 21 of the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 1997. The Department guidelines require that expenditure of this type must be reimbursed to the Department as by the card holder in accordance with its acquittal procedures.                              (b) 2009-2010                              (i) There were six instances of non-compliance with departmental guidelines relating to the use of departmental credit cards for non-official purposes.                               (ii) The dollar amount of each instance is outlined in the table below. The full amount in each instance has been reimbursed to the Department.                              (iii) All officers that were non-compliant were counselled on the proper use of the cards and their responsibilities as cardholders. All non-compliance involved accidental use.                              (c) 2010-2011                              (i) There were eight instances of non-compliance with departmental guidelines relating to the use of departmental credit cards for non-official purposes.                               (ii) The dollar amount of each instance is outlined in the table below. In relation to non compliance 7 and 8, the full amounts have been reimbursed to the Department. Responsibility for the recovery of the amounts listed for non-compliance 1 6 became the responsibility of the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport when the Territories Division moved to that Department as a result of the Administrative Arrangements Order of 14 October 2010.                              (iii) In relation to non-compliance 7 and 8 the officers were counselled on the proper use of the cards and their responsibilities as cardholders. These instances of non-compliance involved accidental use. Responsibility for disciplinary action for non-compliances 1 - 6 is with the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport.                               Non-Compliance by Year                                                                            </DOC>

(6) The Minister for Tertiary Education has received a letter from Ben Bardon, CEO, Skillset, requesting additional funding. The Minister is currently considering the request, but as noted below in the response to Question 7, there is no legal obligation on the Government to provide additional funding.                               (7) The $5 million in funding from EIF was for capital costs and no Australian Government funding has ever been provided for recurrent or operational costs. The Australian Government has no legal obligation to provide additional funding under the terms and conditions of the EIF funding agreement. Skillset has confirmed that it does not receive operational funding from the Australian Government.                              (8) This information was requested from Skillset.

                              (i) In 2010-11 there were no instances of credit card usage that breached departmental guidelines.                              Between 2008-09 and 2009-10 two staff members breached departmental guidelines in relation to the use of credit cards.                               In the first case an investigation in 2009 uncovered eleven instances of a breach of departmental guidelines.                               In the second case an investigation in 2009 uncovered two instances of a breach of departmental guidelines.                               (ii) In the first case the total value of the eleven breaches was $2,494 which was fully repaid.                              In the second case the total value of the two breaches was $295 which was fully repaid.                              (iii) In the first case the employee was suspended whilst a formal investigation was undertaken.                               In the second case a formal investigation was undertaken.                              Both investigations determined that breaches of the APS Code of Conduct had occurred and sanctions were recommended. Both employees were terminated at their request before sanctions could be imposed.                                                                            </DOC>

                              Continuous glucose monitors are not currently listed on the National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS), as these products are medical devices, not consumable items.                              The NDSS provides subsidies for consumables items such as syringes and needles for insulin delivery, blood glucose test strips, urine ketone test strips and insulin pump consumables.                                There are two insulin pumps listed under the Prostheses List that include integrated continuous glucose monitors. Private health insurers may pay benefits for medical devices on the Prostheses List. However, it is up to each individual health insurer to determine whether they cover such products.              </DOC>

                               (a) to (c)(i) The number of times the use of corporate credit cards breached departmental guidelines in the years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 is set out in the following table:                                                             (ii) The total dollar value of the breaches and repayment amounts for the years 2008 - 09, 2009-10 and 2010 - 11 is set out in the following table:                                                             (iii) Most credit card breaches of departmental guidelines occur by mistake and are generally fixed by the card holder as soon as the mistake is realised. In all instances of breaches of the departmental guidelines, the offending officers were reminded of their obligations when using a corporate credit card. In addition, every instance of misuse of corporate credit card is reviewed and, where doubts exist, referred for further investigation.                               Such investigations resulted in the preparation of one brief for prosecution in 2009-10. Such action was not necessary in the other years.                                                                            </DOC>

                                                      Mr Bowen                     The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows.                              Visa Grants                              Table 1 lists the Migration Program Outcome for each subclass and year as requested in the question.                              Table 1                              *The 2011-12 figure is up to 29/02/2012                              ^The term Migration Program Outcome refers to visa grants counted in the Migration Program. Contributory Parent visas contain 'two-stage' visa processing, where clients have the option of applying for a temporary Contributory Parent visa (Subclass 173 or Subclass 884) prior to applying for the permanent Contributory Parent visa (Subclass 143 or Subclass 864). Where a client undergoes 'two-stage' visa processing they are only counted in the Migration Program once.                                                                  Processing Times                                                                                  Parent Category                                              New Parent category visa applicants (Subclasses 103 or 804) can expect an approximate 15 year wait before visa grant consideration after being allocated a queue date. This waiting period reflects the significant number of Parent category visa applications in comparison to the limited number of visa places available each Migration Program year.                              For example, 2000 visa places have been available in the Parent category in 2011-12. As there are 28,948 visa applicants in the pipeline (as at 31 January 2012), new applicants will reach the front of the queue approximately 15 years after being allocated a queue date.                                                                  Contributory Parent Category                                              Contributory Parent visa applicants can expect to wait 12 to 24 months before visa grant consideration, depending on their circumstances. As current migration planning levels sufficiently cater for demand for these visas, new Contributory Parent category visa applicants are not being provided with a queue date.              </DOC>

                              Australia recognises the importance of providing legal protections to migrant workers. The human rights of migrants and temporary entrants to Australia are protected under existing domestic and international law, including the human rights conventions to which Australia is already a party. Australia passed new domestic laws in 2008 to better protect temporary overseas workers in Australia - the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008.                              In 2009, the Government undertook analysis of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (Convention) and in 2010 determined that it was incompatible with domestic migration policies.                              For example, at times the Convention does not distinguish between those who are working lawfully and those working unlawfully. Becoming party to the Convention would also require Australia to treat migrant workers and their family members more favourably than other migrants in visa application processes.                              Becoming a party to the Convention would require potentially significant changes to Australia's visa regime for non-citizens with work rights and their families. The analysis of the Convention in 2009 involved an article by article assessment of the Convention. As a result of this analysis, in 2010 the Government decided to maintain its position not to become a party to the Convention.                              The Australian Government views existing protections in place for migrant workers as adequate and does not intend to become a party to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families.              </DOC>

                              Australia Post regrettably had to cease trading in Dampier on 23 March 2012 due to the lack of availability of suitable premises from which to operate the Licensed Post Office (LPO).                              Despite an extensive search within the community, Australia Post has, to date, been unable to locate a local business to take over the ongoing operation of the LPO.                              Due to the shortage of properties within Dampier, Australia Post is again appealing to local business owners to assist in securing a new location for the LPO to ensure continuity of postal services to the community.                              Australia Post is committed to the Dampier community and will continue to work with local businesses to find an alternative solution to resume postal services in Dampier.              </DOC>

Over 400 people attended, including approximately 35 Indigenous Australian non-government representatives and five Australian Government representatives, along with representatives from UN Permanent Missions and delegations to the Permanent Forum. The reception featured food prepared by the chefs of the television show MasterChef Australia, and MasterChef contributed substantially to the food and venue costs (including audio-visual equipment).                              The Australian Permanent Mission to the United Nations provided AUD8,947.06 towards the event, which was a unique public diplomacy opportunity for Australia to promote our work on indigenous issues, and promote indigenous issues globally. Details of that expenditure were as follows:                                                             (2) No. Nil.                              (3) The Mission provided advice to the producers in their interaction with the United Nations. There were no costs incurred.                              (4) The Mission liaised with the United Nations on the arrangements to enable filming on United Nations premises.              </DOC>

                               (a) (i). In the 2010-11 Budget the Australian Government committed $9.7 million over four years to countering violent extremism in Australia. The Building Community Resilience (BCR) grants program is one component of the overall strategy across all levels of government to address extremist influences before they pose a threat to our security. The grants program supports community-based projects that assist individuals and groups to resist or disengage from intolerant and radical ideologies, and encourage positive and constructive community participation. Projects include work across the areas of education, skill building and developing counter narratives to challenge violent extremism and extremist ideologies. Through the BCR grants program, 29 projects have been funded (to the total value of $2.8 million).                              (ii) The Islamic Society of Victoria is not a recipient of funding from the BCR grants program and has not been funded to undertake any other activities through the $9.7 million allocated from the 2010-11 Budget to counter violent extremism.                              (iii) The Government's CVE program, including the BCR grants program, is not funding anyone, including overseas religious workers, to spread Islam in Australia. In July 2011, Darebin City Council was awarded a BCR grant of $100,000 including $66,000 for the employment of an outreach officer based in Australia. The role of the outreach officer is to build stronger relationships between Muslim and non-Muslim communities within Australia by supporting and delivering opportunities for interfaith dialogue and education.                               (b) The CVE Program is directed at all types of violent extremism, regardless of the motivation or ideology. The aim of the Building Community Resilience grants program is to support local initiatives that actively address and discourage violent extremism in all its forms. Neither the broader CVE strategy nor the grants program promotes an ideology of any kind, be it religious, political or otherwise. The BCR grants program is open to all communities in Australia.              </DOC>

                                              In respect of current Tourism Ambassadors under the Tourism Ambassador Program:                              (a) How many Ambassadors are currently engaged                              Tourism Australia (TA) currently has over 160 international and Australian based advocates in its ambassador program, known as the Friends of Australia program (FOA). Ambassadors engaged as part of FOA have committed to help promote Australia without financial payment. See Attachment A.                              TA also engages with Australian and international personalities in broader marketing projects. Any activity that a FOA is engaged in where their services go beyond that of their FOA commitment is dealt with as part the broader marketing project they are engaged in.                              (b) Does each primarily conduct their work domestically or internationally                              FOAs are engaged in opportunities both domestically and internationally free of charge.                               Examples of domestic work include but are not limited to:                              participating in media interviews and content projects as part of TA's domestic marketing strategy;                              providing testimonial content (both written and video) that is distributed via Australia.com, Tourism Australia's You Tube channel and other digital platforms;                              blogging and using social networks to share positive stories about Australia.                              Examples of international work include but are not limited to:                              hosting international media and participating in interviews as part of TA's International Media Hosting Program;                              providing testimonial content to be used in advertorials, editorials, digital and broadcast content initiatives;                              attending TA related events in key markets, such as G'day LA, press conferences, launch announcements and media briefings.                              (c) Is their work voluntary or paid; if the latter, how is payment determined (ie, fixed term, fee per event) and what sum was paid per Ambassador in 2010-11; if under contract, on what date will each contract expire                              FOA are not paid for their involvement in the program and advocate about Australia on a voluntary basis.                              On occasion, TA does offer paid opportunities for FOAs, where the scope of work is considered to require significant time and effort on behalf of the ambassador. Examples of this include:                               A FOA hosting a TA owned television series or major broadcast initiative, other than general editorial coverage                              A FOA emceeing an event, such as a press conference or stakeholder event                              A FOA appointed as a formal ambassador for a specific campaign, that requires a significant working commitment                              In instances where a FOA is paid for their activities, payment is determined as a one off fee per event/ campaign/ opportunity. When a Friend of Australia is involved in activity as part of a marketing campaign (such as a television series or as an ambassador for a specific campaign), this activity is considered beyond their involvement in the FOA program, and is managed and paid as part of the relevant marketing project.                              Ambassadors currently under contract include:                              Matt Moran is currently under contract for the T-Qual Tick Tour campaign. His contract ends 31/07/2012.                               Erica Angyal is an Australian expatriate living in Japan and is under contract for her services as an ambassador until 31/12/2014.                              Please see part (d) for payments to FOA.                              (d) What costs have each Ambassador incurred (to date) in performing their duties, and                              In 2010/11 no payments were made to FOA.                              In 2011/12 FOA were paid as follows:                              Steve Liebmann emceed 5 Tourism Australia press conferences to date, at a reduced average fee of $2500 (+GST) per event;                               Catriona Rowntree emceed 1 Tourism Australia event, at a reduced fee of $1000 (+GST);                              Sophie Falkiner emceed 1 Tourism Australia press conference at a reduced fee of $1500 (+GST).                              In 2011/12 FOAs engaged in broader marketing activities including the domestic Dream Team promotion, T-Qual Tick Tour and No Leave No Life TV Show were paid as follows:                              Tim Ross - paid by Endemol Southern Star (ESS) who produced No Leave No Life season 3. Payment by ESS was for 7 episodes of No Leave No Life season 3, including 7 weeks of filming. Tim Ross was not a FOA until after the series went to air.                               Matt Moran - paid a fee of $108,000 for services as T-Qual Tick ambassador and participation in the T-Qual Tick Tour from 22 March  -  27 July 2012, including visits to over 52 T-Qual accredited operators.

(e) What total sum was spent on the Tourism Ambassador Program in 2010-11, and is budgeted to be spent 2011-12.                              In addition to the direct payments outlined in question (D), TA allocates an annual operating budget to support the development of the program. Payments made to FOAs are through the marketing project or event budget, and not as a FOA.                              The total budget spent on the FOA program in 2010-11 was $142,000. This included video production, content development, an annual networking event and fees to an external public relations company to manage the program.                               The total budget allocated to the FOA program in 2011-12 is $49,500.00. The 2011-12 FOA budget does not include the services of a public relations company, as the program is now managed within TA.

                              (1) The Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 requires that the Australian Government Budget be based on external reporting standards. The budget treatment of the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund (REVCF) is consistent with these external accounting and budget rules.                              The REVCF provides early-stage equity investments to encourage the development of Australian companies that are commercialising renewable energy technologies.                               The underlying cash balance impact of the REVCF reflects the full write-down of these equity investments at the early proof of concept stage. Early-stage investments generally involve a higher degree of risk (and are, therefore, essentially treated as a grant for budget accounting purposes).                              (2) The Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 requires that the budget be based on external reporting standards. The budget treatment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) is consistent with these external accounting and budget rules.                              The estimated underlying cash balance impact of the CEFC of $312 million across the forward estimates includes an allowance for unrecovered investments, interest and dividend receipts and departmental costs, excluding public debt interest costs.                               The CEFC will provide commercial loans, concessional loans, loan guarantees and equity for the commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy and enabling technologies, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies. It will also invest in the transformation of existing manufacturing businesses.                               The CEFC costing took into account the Government's policy that that the CEFC invest in a mix of commercial projects earning a positive return and non-commercial, higher risk projects with a probability of not recovering the investment or achieving a positive return.                               As the renewable energy stream is expected to invest in some higher risk projects, a 15 per cent allowance for unrecovered investments has been included in the costing for the CEFC. This represents a conservative approach to budgeting, rather than a forecast of expected activity.                              To the extent that the transactions are commercial there will be a limited impact on the underlying cash balance because they are largely balance sheet transactions changing the composition of financial assets.                              Treasury expects that taxpayers will, over time, get a positive return on the investment through interest and dividends.              </DOC>

                              (1) In respect of the Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) system:                              the total sum of revenue collected from ETAs from 04 February 2007 to 03 February 2012 is $38,289,140;                              In 2008-09, revenue of $8,020,460.00 was generated.                              In 2009-10, revenue of $7,259,480.00 was generated                              In 2010-11, revenue of $7,090,980.00 was generated                              The amount of revenue to be collected in 2011-12, 2012-13, and 2013-14 is dependant on the number of ETA applicants who utilise the ETA system. Information trends suggest that usage will remain at similar levels over the remaining term of the contract, although a maximum increase of 5.5% per annum has been estimated for planning purposes.                              (2) In respect of the contract for the ETA system a competitive tender process was used to select a provider of the required services. SITA Global Services provides access to the ETA system. The original signatory to the contract was CPS Systems Pty Limited. CPS Systems Pty Limited was acquired by SITA Global Services in January 2010 and the contract was novated to SITA Global Services soon after.                              The ETA system contract commenced on 04 February 2007 for an initial term of four (4) years, with two (2) options to extend the contract for up to two (2) years for each option. Both options to extend have been exercised by the Department following an assessment and confirmation of value for money consistent with the requirements of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines (CPGs).  The contract does not contain any further options for extension.                              Much of the contract contains information that is commercially sensitive, however an extract of those parts of the contract that concern the ETAS services has been provided for your reference.                              (3) None of the $20 internet application fee is retained by SITA. All ETA application fees are remitted to DIAC on a monthly basis. SITA is paid a monthly fixed charge for the provision of ETA system services.

Subclasses 104 and 806 were repealed as of 1/11/1999 however finalisations of ongoing visa applications in these subclasses after this repeal date are included within the Other Family category.

The time taken to assess these visa applications is subject to variation between processing offices depending on the size and composition of the visa caseload at the particular processing office, the priority level of the visas in this caseload, the complexity of individual cases and the response time for clients to provide the necessary information and documentation                  .

However, it should be noted that the introduction of cap and queue arrangements has meant that there are a significant number of applications which have been assessed as meeting core visa requirements for the purpose of queuing, but are yet to be finalised pending places in the migration program to proceed to grant. This will have an impact on future data of average processing times once finalisation of these applications (grant) has been completed.                                                 * 2011-12 program year finalisations as at 29 February 2012                                                &gt; All grants of  Aged Dependent Relative (Subclass 838) visas for 2011-12 to date have been by Ministerial Intervention.

                              The Department currently uses two credit cards, Mastercard for general business expenditure and Diners for travel related expenditure.                               All cardholders must understand the responsibilities associated with the use of the corporate credit cards. Employees are required to pass a test on departmental credit card policies before being issued with a corporate credit card. A breach of departmental policies can lead to the card being withdrawn and may also result in serious disciplinary action.                              In all but two of the instances of breaches of departmental policies noted below, inappropriate use of the Commonwealth cards occurred due to accidental personal use.                              (i) The number of times the use of a credit card has breached departmental guidelines is provided below:                                                             (ii) The dollar value of each breach and the sum repaid in each instance is provided below:                              NOTE *: This breach was not identified until after the staff member left the APS. The Department did not pursue the matter further on the assessment that available evidence was insufficient to substantiate criminal proceedings through the Australian Federal Police.                              For the financial years 2009-10 and 2010-11 all breaches were repaid.                              (iii) The number of employees disciplined for these breaches is provided below:                                                                                                 The single case referred to above in 2008-09 is a case where the employee was formally investigated by the Department, found to have breached the APS Code of Conduct and was disciplined.

                              (1) The Australian Government has given effect under Australian law to all sanctions obligations imposed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in relation to Iran.                              In relation to Australian autonomous sanctions measures (that is, measures applied autonomously of a UNSC obligation), the measures announced by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs on 6 December 2011 and 24 January 2012 are currently subject to public consultation and it is expected they will commence on 1 July 2012. These measures, once in force, would prohibit, without prior authorisation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs:                              (a) the import, purchase or transport of specified Iranian crude oil, petroleum or petrochemical products;                              (b) the provision of financial assistance or a financial service related to the import, purchase or transport of such products;                              (c) the acquisition or extension of an interest in, or the establishment of or participation in a joint venture with, or the granting of a financial loan or credit to  -  an entity in Iran that is engaged in the petrochemical, oil or gas industry in Iran, or  -  an Iranian or Iranian owned entity involved in such industries outside Iran;                              (d) the sale or otherwise making available of an interest in a commercial activity in Australia that is related to the oil and gas industry to the Iranian Government or an Iranian company or citizen;                              (e) the direct or indirect sale, purchase, transportation or brokerage of gold, diamonds or precious metals to, from or for the Iranian Government, its public bodies, corporations or agencies, or the Central Bank of Iran;                              (f) the opening in Australia of a branch, subsidiary or representative office of, or the establishment of a joint venture with, or the acquisition of ownership of an Australian financial institution by, or the establishment or maintenance of a correspondent relationship with  -  a financial institution that is operated by or on behalf of the Iranian Government, an Iranian company or citizen;                              (g) the establishment of a representative office or subsidiary in Iran, or the opening of a bank account in Iran, by a financial institution; and                              (h) the delivery of newly printed or unissued Iranian denominated bank notes or newly minted or unissued Iranian denominated coinage to or for the Central Bank of Iran.                              (2) Australia's autonomous sanctions regime in relation to Iran is broadly consistent with that of the European Union and the United Kingdom. The principal differences between the regimes are:                              (a) the measures listed in paragraphs (a) to (h) in the response to question (1), which the European Union and United Kingdom currently impose and which Australia is in the process of bringing into force;                              (b) an additional 'human rights' criterion applied by the European Union and United Kingdom to designate persons as being subject to targeted financial and travel sanctions;                              (c) in relation to the United Kingdom only, a requirement for all financial transactions with Iran to be subject to prior authorisation (Australian law requires authorisation for any transaction with Iran valued at $20,000 or more).                              The sanctions regimes of Australia, the European Union or the United Kingdom are not directly comparable to US sanctions against Iran in terms of reach and restrictiveness, including provision under US law for imposing sanctions on third country persons who engage in specific kinds of trade and investment with Iran. Detailed information about US sanctions can be found at www.treasury.gov.                              (3) A number of existing Australian measures are of general application and apply to all financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Iran. This includes the requirement under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Regulations 2008 for authorisation for any transaction with Iran valued at $20,000 or more. Of the measures expected to commence on 1 July 2012, those referred to in paragraphs (e) and (h) in the response to question (1) above will apply directly to the Central Bank of Iran, and that referred to in paragraph (f) in the response to question (1) above will apply to the Central Bank of Iran in the same way it would apply to any Iranian financial institution. These measures are broadly consistent with measures imposed by the European Union and the United Kingdom.               </DOC>

In preparing such advice, PMC draws on information from other departments and agencies as appropriate, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as it did on this occasion.                              Question (3)                              I released a joint statement with President Bongo following our meeting on 29 March, which notes that we had wide-ranging discussions on a number of important issues, including food security, climate change, peace and security challenges, trade, natural resources governance and development cooperation. I, along with other members of my government, regularly talk to other leaders and governments about the strong contribution Australia would make to the United Nations Security Council if elected.                              Question (4)                              President Bongo's visit to Australia was a state visit conducted under the guest of government program. The usual range of costs was covered by the Australian Government, including accommodation and ground transport. I am advised that the total cost of the visit was $156,991.44 (including GST).                              Question (5)                              President Bongo did not use the Australian Government's special purpose aircraft during his visit.                                                                            </DOC>

                              The question of a draft code of conduct for Members of Parliament was referred by the Government to the House Standing Committee on Privileges and Members' Interests and the Senate Standing Committee of Senators' Interests on 23 November 2010 and 2 March 2011 respectively.                                The House Committee reported on 23 November 2011.  While the report did not contain any recommendations, it did include a draft code of conduct for Members.  The Senate Committee is not due to report before 27 November 2012.                                The Government notes that the Member for Lyne has moved a motion proposing that the House endorse a code of conduct for Members of the House of Representatives and will consider the adoption of a code in that context.              </DOC>

                              I am aware of the case regarding Ms Ranjiny (Ranjini) Perinparasa.  Ms Perinparasa and her two children are currently being accommodated at Sydney Immigration Residential Housing (IRH).  This facility is an alternative place of immigration detention.                              On 24 April 2012, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) advised the Department that the Director-General of Security issued an adverse security assessment to Ranginy Perinparasa who ASIO assesses to be directly (or indirectly) a risk to security within the meaning of section 4 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979.  This means that she does not fulfil the criteria for grant of a visa to settle in Australia permanently.                              The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship does have discretion to grant a visa in the public interest to any person in immigration detention.  However, it is current Government policy that persons with an adverse security assessment not be released into the community.                                                                            </DOC>

                              Since 1 January 2008, the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has not contracted Skills Training Australia Pty Ltd, 92 Copeland Street, Liverpool, NSW, to conduct training.                                                                            </DOC>

                              The department's credit card management system was implemented in April 2009. The systems used prior to this date have been de-commissioned and the information requested prior to this date is not readily available.                              The majority of instances of misuse relate to circumstances where the officer has mistaken the corporate credit card for their own. Where card misuse has been repeated or the intention of the card holder appears to be of concern these matters have been referred for follow up action. There have been a small number of more serious cases which have led to formal investigations. The department requires full reimbursement in all instances.                              The breaches represent less than 0.05% of the value of transactions made using departmental credit cards.                              From 1 April 2009-30 June 2009 there were 45 instances of breaches of departmental credit card guidelines. The dollar value of the breaches is as follows:                              No internal investigations were finalised during the period.                               For the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 there were 108 instances of breaches of credit card guidelines. The dollar value of the breaches is as follows:                              Three internal investigations were finalised during the period.                               For the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 there were 64 instances of breaches of credit card guidelines. The dollar value of the breaches is as follows:                              One internal investigation was finalised during the period.                               During the 2010-11 financial year one instance of serious credit card misuse was identified totalling $39,711.42. The officer's employment has been terminated and a repayment arrangement is in place to fully recover the funds.              </DOC>

                              (a) to (c) The Department of Health and Ageing had the following breaches of departmental guidelines for credit cards that constituted a breach of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and Regulations:                              Two breaches in 2008-09 for the amounts of $200 and $91 GST inclusive;                               Two breaches in 2009-10 for the amounts of $50 and $12 GST inclusive; and                               No breaches in 2010-11.                               In each of these cases a debt was raised against the credit card user and the amount was repaid to the department. Staff were reminded of their responsibilities and conditions of use for departmental credit cards.                               There were a number of instances where the credit card limit was exceeded, contrary to departmental guidelines, however these were for legitimate departmental purposes, therefore it was not considered necessary to provide details. The Department has reminded all credit card holders of limits pertaining to credit cards and regularly monitors credit card usage to ensure limits are observed.               </DOC>

                              (1) In respect of the GP Super Clinic currently under construction on Charters Towers Road in Townsville:                              (a) The total Commonwealth funding for the project is $5.5 million (GST inclusive);                              (b) The hours of operation of the GP Super Clinic, as approved by the Townsville City Council, will be 7am  -  11pm seven days a week;                              (c) Bulk billing is anticipated for clients with concession cards, children under 16 and senior citizens over 65;                              (d) Triage protocols are a matter for the operator and will be determined closer to the opening date of the GP Super Clinic.                              (2) In respect of the establishment of a GP Super Clinic for the Northern Beaches suburbs of Townsville, this will be dependent on:                              (a) the achievement of a successful proposal in the ITA process; and                              (b) the successful negotiation of a funding agreement with the applicant.                                                                            </DOC>

                              Divisions across the department undertake a wide variety of economic and quantitative analysis, dealing with a wide range of issues that could be categorised as economic modelling. More formal and extensive modelling is undertaken principally by the Macroeconomic Modelling Division, Domestic Economy Division and Tax Analysis Division.                              Treasury's Macroeconomic Modelling Division has undertaken extensive economic modelling on the impact of a carbon price. Economic modelling was released in October 2008 and reported in the Government's Australia's low pollution future: the economics of climate change report. Additional modelling was released in July 2011 and reported in the Government's Strong growth, low pollution: modelling a carbon price report. The Macroeconomic Modelling Division also maintains and develops a range of models which are used to help inform policy debate such as tax reform and assist in projecting aspects of the economy.                               Treasury's Tax Analysis Division performs the key functions of revenue forecasting, developing cost estimates and distributional analysis, and undertaking other quantitative studies. Economic modelling plays a part in all these functions and, accordingly, amounts to a large part of the day to day activities of the division, rather than being some discrete exercise undertaken from time to time. The issues on which the modelling is undertaken cover the range of matters handled by the division.                              Treasury's Domestic Economy Division maintains a range of models which are used to help forecast different aspects of the economy. These models are typically used heavily during forecasting rounds, particularly ahead of the Budget and MYEFO but, because they are being continuously updated and refined, are often run more frequently. These sectoral models complement other sources of information, such as information from business liaison, when producing the macroeconomic orecasts.                              In addition, as part of the Review into the governance, efficiency, structure and operation of Australia's superannuation system, Treasury conducted modelling to estimate the possible long-run and short-run, direct and indirect impact of the review's recommendations on superannuation fees.              </DOC>

                              I can advise that on 10 May 2011 the Australian Government announced that as part of the 2011-12 Federal Budget, funding of $3 million was being provided to Mercy Health for the expansion of the operating theatre at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Mackay. This project will increase the hospital's surgical capacity and service provision to the wider Mackay region.              </DOC>

                              (a) and (b) Payments under the Practice Incentives Program General Practitioner Aged Care Access Incentive (PIP GP ACAI) are made to GPs, rather than to a practice participating in the PIP.  As the Department holds PIP GP ACAI payment data according to GP provider numbers rather than PIP practice identification numbers, it is not possible to report on how many PIP GP ACAI payments have been made to a GP Super Clinic.              </DOC>

                              As at 26 June 2012, 26 GP Super Clinics were operational. Of these:                              (a) 17 have received the Practice Incentives Program (PIP) Indigenous Health Incentive Sign-on Payment1;                              (b) 12 have received PIP Indigenous Health Incentive Patient Registration Payments2;                              (c) (i) 9 have received PIP Indigenous Health Incentive Tier 1 Outcomes Payments; and                              (ii) 13 have received PIP Indigenous Health Incentive Tier 2 Outcomes Payments.                               When registering for the PIP, GP Super Clinics are not required to identify as such and do not necessarily use their GP Super Clinic name for the purposes of the PIP. The Department has therefore where possible, matched the address of a GP Super Clinic to that of a practice participating in the PIP for the purposes of this analysis.              </DOC>

                              I refer to your three questions on 8 February 2012, asking:                              (1) Whether any tenders were received for the roll-out of set-top boxes throughout Australia under the Household Assistance Scheme?                               (2) Can I indicate who submitted the tenders?                              (3) Whether any of the prices tendered were less than the one selected?                              The answers to these questions are as follows:                              (1) Yes.

                                              (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) Program 1.3  -  Border Protection and Enforcement, largely covers our Enforcement and Investigations and Intelligence and Targeting Divisions. It does not include cargo inspection activities, including inspection and examination of air, sea and mail cargo which is undertaken by the Cargo Division and reported under Program 1.2  -  Trade Facilitation.                              The tables below outline the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service's estimated resourcing and Full Time Equivalents (FTE) staffing numbers for each of the requested activities undertaken under Program 1.3  -  Border Protection and Enforcement. We have utilised data from the agency's Budget and Resource Management Framework which aligns generally, although not exactly, with the requested categories.                              Prior to 2009-10 Customs and Border Protection reported on an outputs basis, rather than Programs, as per the Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS). It is not possible to provide accurate details of FTE staff or funding on a detail basis for these years as there was no framework in place at the time to capture this data at the level required. In 2009-10 a new costing methodology was introduced which allows analysis at this level to be undertaken. As a result of the limitations noted above, we are unable to accurately provide reliable results for the years prior to 2009-10.                               Similarly, we have been unable to provide accurate cost figures, at the level required, for the forecast years 2012-13 through 2014-15 as Customs and Border Protection is still undertaking its internal budgeting and business planning processes.                                             </DOC>

                               All cargo reporters, including air couriers are required under Customs legislation to electronically report particulars of all goods they have arranged to be carried on an aircraft and are to be unloaded in Australia.                                Air couriers submit electronic reports (Air Cargo Report) to Customs and Border Protection through the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) not later than two hours prior to the arrival of the aircraft at the first airport in Australia. Information in this report is used by Customs and Border Protection to conduct initial risk analysis and assessments.              </DOC>

                               Australia Post does not carry or arrange the carriage of inbound international mail. It is arranged by foreign postal services. Australia Post is responsible for arranging the carriage of outbound international mail.                               All international mail is reported to Customs and Border Protection at the 'receptacle' level (by bag or air unit load device) by the operator of the vessel or aircraft carrying the mail.                              Australia Post does operate some import and export cargo services that are subject to full cargo reporting requirements, which requires the details of all individual items they are importing into Australia to be reported to Customs and Border Protection. This activity represents a small proportion of overall activity undertaken by Australia Post.                               In 2003, Australia Post and seven other national postal operators established the Kahala group to explore new integrated business models. The group now has 10 members comprising: Australia Post, China Post, Correos, Hong Kong Post, Japan Post, Korea Post, La Poste, Royal Mail, Singapore Post and the US Postal Service.                              In recent years, the group has focussed on new logistics frameworks that can be applied to the processing of parcels and Express Mail Service (EMS) items. The group is currently working on electronic reporting for EMS and parcels between group members. It is anticipated that implementation will commence in 2013.               </DOC>

                                               (1) Volumes                              (i) and (ii) The following information was provided by Australia Post through the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy:                              Standard Mail Items includes both letters and parcels. In recent years there has been a continuing and sustained increase in parcels. From a border risk perspective, parcels currently pose a much higher risk than letters. On this basis, Customs and Border Protection increased the number of parcels subject to inspection in 2011-12 and reduced the letters inspected.                               (iii) Articles classified as International Mail can only be transported between members of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). Australia Post is the only Australian member of the UPU and no other entity (including private couriers) may process international mail in Australia.                              (2) Inspections                              The term inspection includes any combination of x-ray, detector dogs, trace detection or physical inspection.                              For postal articles, Customs and Border Protection records inspection activity in two categories:                              Letters; and                              Parcels/Express Mail Service (EMS)/Registered articles.                              The number of articles inspected for each category of international mail is as follows:                                                                  Table Two  -  Inspection Volumes International Mail - 2005/06 to February 2012                                              The number of detections (including quarantine referrals) found in international mail and air cargo are as follows:                                                                   Table Three -  Detections in International Mail - 2005/06 to February 2012                                              The key to the increase in the number of successful detections is the implementation of an intelligence-led approach by Customs and Border Protection.                              In 2010-11 using this intelligence-led approach, Customs and Border Protection made 41,499 detections of prohibited items in international mail compared to just 23,085 detections in 2006-07.                              This represents an 80 % increase in detections in international mail from 2006-07 to 2010-11.                              (3) Forecasts                              (a) and (b) The following information was provided by Australia Post through the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy:                              (c) Articles classified as International Mail can only be transported between members of the Universal Postal Union (UPU).

                                               Customs and Border Protection record and report on weapons and firearms separately as these are differentiated in separate sections of legislation.                              'Weapons' include (but are not limited to) items of warfare, bladed weapons, laser pointers, electric shock devices and crossbows.                               'Firearms' include (but are not limited to) rifles, handguns and firearms and are controlled under different legislation to weapons.                                                                  Number of weapons detained and seized in air cargo, sea cargo and international mail.                                              Customs and Border Protection detains (intercepts) prohibited items at the border. On presentation of an appropriate import permit, detained items are able to be released. If the importation is not permitted or a permit is not presented, the item is seized.                                                                   Table One - Number of weapons detained and seized in air cargo, sea cargo and international mail  -  2005/06 to March 2012                                              # Data not available                                                                  Number of detained (intercepted) undeclared firearms                  +                   in air cargo, sea cargo and international mail.                                              Undeclared firearms are where firearms are imported into Australia and are detected and identified by Customs and Border Protection as prohibited or restricted goods, and where they have not been declared to Customs in accordance with the import requirements. Some of these detained (intercepted) firearms may subsequently be released on presentation of a valid import permit.                                                                  Table Two - Number of detained (intercepted) undeclared firearm detections+ in air cargo, sea cargo and international mail  -  2005/06 to February 2012                                              +This data does not include commercial importations of firearms.                              # Data not available                              Customs and Border Protection advise that 85 per cent of gun and gun part seizures come from intelligence provided by law enforcement agencies before the parcel or container even arrives in Australia. Since the implementation of a risk-based, intelligence-led approach to intervention across the end to end cargo process in 2009, Customs and Border Protection's detections at the border have increased significantly. The figures above demonstrate the importance of an intelligence-led approach to detecting prohibited items at the borders.               </DOC>

                               Australia Post's role within the international gateway is to handle international mail, including sorting and presenting the mail according to requests by border agency officers from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs and Border Protection) or the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF). Australia Post is also required to open specific articles for examination by border agencies when requested under their direction and supervision.                              Customs and Border Protection and DAFF officers determine the risk rating of items in accordance with their risk-assessment practices. Customs and Border Protection is responsible for assessing items for revenue purposes, including those that meet the low value threshold.              </DOC>

Depending on the specific training package, this may be undertaken on an annual basis, or every two years. A centralised database is maintained of training certification for LPOs.

                               Commencing 1 January 2011, the law enforcement-related aspects of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service were added by Regulation to the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI).  By subsequent amendment to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, commencing 6 December 2012, Customs and Border Protection was added to ACLEI's jurisdiction on a whole-of-agency basis.                              ACLEI advises that, as at 22 March 2012, seven corruption issues relating to Customs and Border Protection were being investigated by the Integrity Commissioner.  Four of these investigations were commenced on 10 January 2011. The others were commenced on 16 March 2011, 1 September 2011 and 21 October 2011, respectively.                              Each investigation concerns either information or an allegation that a staff member or members may have engaged in conduct that involves an abuse of office and/or conduct that, having regard to the duties and powers of a staff member, may involve corruption of any other kind.  Since these investigations are current, it would not be appropriate to comment further.                              On 30 March 2012 I announced that the Federal Government will introduce legislation to conduct targeted integrity tests on Commonwealth officers suspected of corruption.                               This includes officers from the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.                              Integrity tests are covert operations designed to test whether a public official will respond to a simulated situation in a manner that is illegal or would contravene an agency's standard of integrity.                              Examples of integrity testing include:                              A covert operative handing a wallet containing cash to officers and observing that correct handling protocols are observed;                              Leaving valuable goods at a simulated crime scene or suspected shipping container to test whether an officer steals the item;                              A covert operative offering a Commonwealth officer a bribe; and                              Putting false information in a database to catch a person suspected of unlawfully disclosing information.                              Under the legislation the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and agencies including the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Crime Commission will have the power to conduct targeted integrity testing.                                The Integrity Commissioner or the head of the agency will be responsible for authorising integrity tests.                              The Integrity Commissioner will have overall oversight of the integrity testing system and will be made aware of all integrity tests being undertaken by agencies.                              Oversight will be provided by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.                              Employee representatives are also being consulted on the development of the system to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.                              This legislation will build on the powers that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity already has which include:                              coercive powers to gather information through hearings and notices;                              telecommunications interception and data access;                              electronic surveillance;                              controlled operations and assumed identities;                              search warrants, and                              scrutiny of financial transaction records.                              On 28 April 2012, I announced further reform to make law enforcement more corruption resistant:                              1. Doubling of the number of enforcement agencies oversighted by Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. New agencies to be oversighted by ACLEI are:                              The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  -  Biosecurity Staff (formerly the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service);                              the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC); and                               CrimTrac.                               2. Doubling of resources available to ACLEI to oversee the Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs).                              3. A series of new measures the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission are undertaking and the extension to Customs of the same integrity powers as the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission. These include:                              The power to authorise drug and alcohol testing;                                The power for the CEO to make a declaration terminating the employment of an officer for serious misconduct; and                               The introduction of mandatory reporting requirements, whereby Customs officers are required to report any misconduct or corruption activity.              </DOC>

                               Customs and Border Protection has an organisational mobility policy, the Mobility Practice Statement that facilitates the movement of personnel between work areas.  Mobility processes are conducted at a regional level to meet Customs and Border Protection's operational requirements.                               Since re-institution of the policy in August 2011, mobility processes have been conducted in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.  The policy specifies that mobility processes will be undertaken in each region at the discretion of the respective Regional Senior Management Group (RSMG) and will be driven by identified business requirements and employee considerations.                              Customs and Border Protection does not record data in a way that would readily allow answers to be provided on the length of service of individuals in particular work areas.   To attempt to provide this level of detail would involve an unreasonable diversion of resources.              </DOC>

                              (a) As at 29 May 2012, a total of over 957,000 computers had been installed under the National Secondary School Computer Fund (the Computer Fund).                              (b) and (c) The purchasing ,management and maintenance of ICT equipment under the Computer Fund is taking place at a state, sector or school level. Consistent with the Digital Education Revolution (DER) National Partnership and Funding Agreements, government and non government education authorities provide bi-annual reports to the Australian Government on the number of computers each school receives on a six monthly basis. The July 2012 Progress Reports are currently being received and assessed.                               In addition to formal Progress Reports, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) also monitors implementation of the Computer Fund through its engagement with education authorities on an as needs basis. In the event of reports that there were, for example, instances of non-compliance with the DER National Partnership or Funding Agreements or systemic problems associated with the deployment of devices, DEEWR would seek an explanation from the education authority involved. DEEWR is aware of individual instances of equipment failure but not of any systemic problems.                              Government and non-government education authorities are responsible for achieving and maintaining the one to one computer to student ratio (1:1 ratio) for all Australian schools with students in Years 9 -12. Where computers are taken out of service, for example for maintenance purposes, it is the responsibility of the relevant education authorities to ensure that students are not unduly disadvantaged and that they continue to have access at a 1:1 ratio.                               (d) The Australian Government recognises that there are additional costs associated with the implementation of the Computer Fund. In that context, the Government has provided additional funding of $807 million to support the installation and maintenance of computers purchased under the Computer Fund.                               (e) and f) In line with the DER Evaluation Strategy, a mid-program review is currently underway, with consultations occurring during May-July 2012. The Department expects to receive the final report by September 2012. Once the report has been finalised and its contents examined the Department will undertake to release relevant findings within three months of its completion.              </DOC>

                               Does the AFP internally advertise expressions of interest: Yes, for selected roles requiring specialised skill sets. For general policing roles members of the Mission Component (i.e. the permanent deployable pool of experienced staff) are selected and deployed based on field of expertise.                              (a) How: The AFP advertises Expressions of Interest (EOI) for mission roles openly through internal communication channels such as all staff emails or via the AFP's intranet. A selection process is undertaken in accordance with internal governance documentation (Australian Federal Police Commissioners Order on Selection for Vacant Roles (CO7)).                              (b) What measures have been undertaken to ensure:                              (i) Enhanced consultation with the Solomon Islands Ministry and Police personnel: AFP personnel in the Solomon Islands are deployed through the multi-national Participating Police Force (PPF), the policing component of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The PPF Commander (an AFP member) also performs the role of Deputy Commissioner Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF). There is a great deal of engagement between the PPF and the RSIPF both at the executive level and at the rank and file level with PPF members working along side RSIPF members in an 'advisor' role, often as a one on one counterpart arrangement. The PPF remains engaged with the Solomon Islands Government Ministry for Police, National Security and Correctional Services, in partnership with the RSIPF Commissioner.                              The transition plan for the PPF was developed in consultation with the RSIPF including identification of key roles and areas of responsibility where an advisory capacity was seen as appropriate. The PPF structure, which is the catalyst for any internal opportunities, has been developed to complement the new RSIPF revised structure.                               (ii) That a proportion of AFP personnel sent to the Solomon Islands has recent front line policing experience: Selection processes for mission roles, either through an EOI process or through selection from the Mission Component, ensure that contemporary front line policing experience is delivered in mission roles.                               Mission Component members rotate between mission deployment and Australia based deployments. Whilst in Australia they perform a variety of front line roles to ensure contemporary experience is maintained.                               RAMSI has embarked on a process of drawdown which commenced in 2010 and as a part of this drawdown the PPF has been transitioning from front line policing to capacity development. This transition requires a broad range of both policing and non-policing skill sets, in a variety of traditional and non traditional policing functions. The PPF ensures that the correct balance of skill sets from the AFP and all other contributing nations continues to meet the ongoing requirements of the RSIPF.               </DOC>

                              (a) The participation trust fund for Rio +20 is managed by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).                              (b) As managers of the trust fund, DESA decide on the allocation of funding.                              (c) DESA will consider applications on a first-come-first-served basis. Countries are able to request support for up to two participants. Member states are encouraged to be represented at the conference at the highest possible level including Heads of State or Government.                              (d) Funding is available to developing countries, including the least developed countries. Australia has expressed its preference that the funds be used to support representatives from the Asia-Pacific region, particularly least developed countries and small island developing states.                              (e) The participation trust fund is operated in accordance with the United Nations financial rules and regulations.                              (f) Other countries that have contributed to the fund include Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Iceland, Japan, Mauritius, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. We do not have a breakdown of individual funding.              </DOC>

                              (1) (a) Yes.                               (b) and (c) usAID consulted on this matter with relevant Australian Government agencies: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Australian Government Solicitor; the Australian Federal Police; and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.                              (2) Through thorough examination of material alleging such links, and other relevant material, in consultation with relevant Australian Government agencies and others, AusAID determined that there was no evidence of a breach of the UN Charter Act as a result of AusAID funding of UAWC-implemented activities through World Vision. In particular, none of the material examined demonstrated that assets had been provided, directly or indirectly, to a proscribed entity or that any other entity has, or had, effective control over UAWC's assets.                               (3) Under the Australia Middle East NGO Cooperation Agreement (AMENCA) program, background checks on staff and officials of UAWC are the responsibility of World Vision. AusAID consulted with the Department of Foreign Affairs to confirm that UAWC Board members are not listed under the UN Charter Act.                               (4) AusAID requires that all those involved in managing and implementing Australia's aid program make all reasonable efforts to ensure that aid funds and resources are not used to support terrorist activity. AusAID's contracts and agreements require other parties to use their best endeavours to comply with the law. The actions required to satisfy these legal and contractual obligations may differ depending on particular circumstances. At a minimum, AusAID expects all development partners :                              To know the persons/organisations that are being directly assisted;                              To make sure that people/organisations being directly assisted are not listed as terrorist organisations for the purposes of the Criminal Code or listed as proscribed persons or entities for the purposes of the UN Charter Act (1945).                              To make sure that directly funded persons/organisations are aware of and obliged to comply with relevant Australian laws, and that they in turn are obliged to make sure that their distribution of the funds or support is made on the same basis.              </DOC>

                              The Government is not building or operating an immigration detention centre on the Cocos Islands. As is appropriate, the department is making contingency arrangements to accommodate any irregular maritime arrivals who might arrive at the Cocos Islands for short periods until they can be transferred to Christmas Island.                               The department, in consultation with the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport, is considering options for holding irregular maritime arrivals for short periods on the Cocos Islands using existing infrastructure pending transfer to Christmas Island. Work has commenced on minor refurbishment works to the Quarantine Station on West Island. It is estimated that these works will cost $50 000. The Quarantine Station can hold approximately 80 persons on a short term basis pending transfer to Christmas Island. There will also be capacity to house agency and service provider personnel to support the response to any arrivals at the Cocos Islands.                              The department aims to transfer irregular maritime arrivals at the Cocos Islands to Christmas Island as soon as possible. Normally, this is within 72 hours.                              Due to the isolated nature of the Cocos Islands, the department relies on air services to respond quickly to irregular maritime arrivals at the Cocos Islands. Charter costs vary according to the size of the aircraft used and its routing. The department follows Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines to source aircraft for charter services and uses panel arrangements established by the Department of Defence.                              The department has a small contingent of officers on the Cocos Islands. These staff currently include a small number of detention service provider personnel and an interpreter, although staffing arrangements are under ongoing review.               </DOC>

                              Strict liability offences form part of a number of regulatory schemes in Commonwealth legislation, many of which fall outside the scope of responsibility of the Attorney-General's Department. There is no existing compilation of strict liability offences contained in Commonwealth legislation. Therefore it would require a manual analysis of all legislation enacted in the 42nd and 43rd Parliaments to identify every strict liability offence.                              Providing such a response would involve an unreasonable diversion of resources. As such, a response cannot be provided.              </DOC>

                              (a) On 9 August 2011, the Minister for Defence announced two new Associate Secretary positions.  The Associate Secretary Capability position was created on the advice of the former Secretary of the Department of Defence with the intent of introducing further delivery of integrated capability development, acquisition and sustainment within the Kinnaird/Mortimer framework.                              (b) The decision to no longer proceed with the recruitment to the Associate Secretary Capability position was made on 3 May 2012 on the advice of current Secretary, when it was announced that the General Manager Submarines position would be created.                               (c) A selection process commenced in November 2011 to fill the Associate Secretary Capability, the Associate Secretary Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Executive Officer, Defence Materiel Organisation. A draft selection report had been received but not actioned.                              (d) A total figure of $96,795.89 was spent on recruitment for the Associate Secretary Capability position.                              (e) The Secretary of Defence determined that a senior officer to provide coordinated oversight and outreach across Government and industry to successfully progress the current and future submarines projects was of greater importance at this time than pursuing an Associate Secretary Capability position.              </DOC>

                              The first release sites for the NBN were chosen and designed to test the variety of locations and operational conditions likely to be encountered in the overall rollout of the NBN.                              The pattern of connection methodologies employed was varied to enable an assessment of performance in these trials. The lessons from these trials are now being incorporated in the design of the volume rollout. Accordingly, the particular characteristics of these trials cannot be considered indicative of the likely experience in the rollout overall.               </DOC>

                              (1) The number of frontline staff (FTE) employed in the Sutherland and Caringbah Centrelink offices in each financial year between 2006-07 and 2011-12 was as follows:                                                             (2) The number of staff seconded to work temporarily in other Centrelink offices or sites from the Sutherland and Caringbah Centrelink offices in each financial year between 2006-07 and 2011-12 was as follows:                              This information is based on the number of employees that were seconded to work for any period during the financial year (i.e. part or full).                                                             (3) Based on current information, the number of frontline staff employed in the Sutherland and Caringbah Centrelink offices in the 2012-13 and 2013-14 financial years is not predicted to change from the number employed in the 2011-12 financial year, as per the following table:                                                             (4) (i) The average length of employment at the Sutherland Centrelink office is 12.8 years as at 31 May 2012.                              (4) (ii) The average length of employment at the Caringbah Centrelink office is 14.8 years as at 31 May 2012.                              (5) The number of staff that left their employment from the Sutherland and Caringbah Centrelink offices in each year from 2008 to 2012 was as follows:                                                              (6) For each case in part (5), the number of staff from the Sutherland and Caringbah Centrelink offices that left due to (a) transfer, (b) redundancy, and (c) dismissal was as follows:                                                                                            (7) In the 2011-12 financial year, refined front-of-house practices (electronic recording of customer entry patterns) have led to an increased number of contacts being recorded at the Sutherland (45,406) and Caringbah (29,901) offices than in previous years. Therefore, the yearly figures provided below cannot be compared with 2011-12 financial year figures.                               The number of cases handled in each financial year between 2006-07 and 2010-11 was as follows:                                                             Note: Figures provided in the above table are indicative and do not capture all customer demand. These figures represent those customers that had a more complex interaction with a customer service officer. It should be noted that over this period the sites queuing strategies and recording practices have changed several times.                               (8) The number of cases forecast to be handled through the Sutherland and Caringbah Centrelink offices in 2012-13 and 2013-14 is as follows:                                                             The number of cases in 2012-13 is expected to increase slightly from the 2011-12 financial year, but remain steady in the 2013-14 financial year.                              Note: The forecasted figures in the above table are also subject to the same limitations explained in the note against question 7 (above).                                                                                                           </DOC>

                              (1) (a) The Government approved the acquisition of up to 214 additional Bushmasters on 26 June 2012.                               (b) The Defence Materiel Organisation executed a Contract Change Proposal for the additional Bushmasters on 13 July 2012.                              (c) The decision has not slipped due to the 2012-13 federal budget.                              (2) (a)The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has a total of 12 C-130H aircraft. Of these, four are currently in preservation maintenance. All 12 C-130H aircraft will be withdrawn from service.                               (b) The intended cease date for C-130H operations is 1 December 2012. C-130H aircraft will be progressively withdrawn from service as each aircraft falls due for its next planned maintenance servicing.                               (c) The C-130H planned withdrawal date previously was December 2013.                               (d) The disposal strategy for the C-130H is being prepared by Defence and will include the transfer of four C-130H aircraft to Indonesia as announced by the Government.                               (e) A total workforce of approximately 250 are employed in support of C-130H aircraft, including prime contracts with QANTAS Defence Services, Raytheon and CAE Ltd and Australian based sub-contractors including Rosebank Engineering, Marshall Aerospace and Kellstrom Australia. The largest segment of industry workforce supporting the C-130H aircraft is approximately 80 QANTAS Defence Services technicians employed at RAAF Base Richmond in airframe deeper maintenance.                               (f) Total RAAF personnel numbers at RAAF Base Richmond are expected to remain about the same as the C-130H aircraft is drawn down. RAAF personnel operating and supporting the C-130H aircraft will be progressively redeployed in 2012 and 2013 across other RAAF capabilities including the C-130J aircraft and C-27J aircraft transition. The C-27J aircraft Squadron will progressively ramp up to a Squadron of approximately 211 personnel, with most of these people drawn from the C-130H aircraft workforce.                               Contractor support requirements at RAAF Base Richmond for both C-130J and C-27J aircraft are currently under review.                              (g) The Minister for Defence has not visited RAAF Base Richmond since the announcement to retire the C-130H fleet. However, the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Geoff Brown visited personnel working to support the C-130H aircraft fleet on 9 May 2012, the day following the Federal Budget announcement.                                                                            </DOC>

                 (a) No. The National Broadband Network (NBN) Implementation Study, the NBN Co. Limited                 Corporate Plan, and the independent verification by financial advisory firm Greenhill Caliburn were                 prepared prior to the funding decision in the 2011-12 Budget to proceed with the investment in the                 NBN.                  The government announced on 7 April 2009 that it would establish a new company to design, build and operate a new enhanced high-speed National Broadband Network (NBN) connecting 90 per cent of all Australian premises with fibre to the premise technology (FTTP) and all other premises with next generation wireless and satellite technology. The decision to adopt FTTP technology was informed by advice from a range of stakeholders including the independent Panel of Experts who advised on the original fibre to the node (FTTN) Request for Proposal (RFP) process. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also endorsed the use of FTTP as a superior technology to FTTN.                 At the time of the NBN announcement the government commissioned a detailed National                 Broadband Network Implementation Study which was undertaken by McKinsey &amp;                 Company/KPMG and completed in March 2010. The study, informed by detailed stakeholder consultations, found that FTTP is widely accepted as the optimal future proof technology and can be built on a commercially viable basis with affordable prices for consumers.                 Following initial equity investments from June 2009 to establish the Company and initiate detailed                 planning, the 2011-12 Budget reflected the Government commitment to proceed with the detailed                 NBN Co Plan, and providing $18.2 billion in equity funding to the NBN Co.                 The funding decision was informed by the NBN Co Corporate Plan 2011-2013. This confirmed that the NBN will provide all Australians with world class broadband on a financially viable basis with affordable prices for consumers. The Greenhill Caliburn Pty Ltd assessment of NBN Co's Corporate Plan 2011-13 concluded that it provides the level of detail and analytical framework that would be expected from a large listed public entity, and taken as a whole is reasonable for the development of the NBN.                 (b) The NBN Co is an investment that is assessed to generate a financial return.                 The National Broadband Network (NBN) Implementation Study, the NBN Co. Limited Corporate                 Plan, and the independent verification by financial advisory firm Greenhill Calibum collectively                 demonstrated the financial viability of the NBN and that the project is feasible.                 The Government has not commissioned any reports to evaluate the Government's policy objectives                 or to evaluate the full social benefits that will result from the implementation of a high speed                 broadband network. The broader economic benefits have, however, been well understood and                 accepted for some time. Such benefits have been documented and endorsed by the Organisation of                 Economic Cooperation and Development, Access Economics and a range of other studies conducted here and overseas prior to the NBN announcement.                 The three studies cited were all concluded prior to the decision to proceed with the investment in the NBN as reflected in the 2011-12 Budget.

                 The Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) manages the whole-of-government fleet and vehicle leasing arrangements with LeasePlan Australia Ltd (LeasePlan).                  (1) As at 30 June 2012, the fleet for the Ministerial responsibilities covered by the questions consisted of 8,348 vehicles of which:                 (a) 2,033 were leased; and (b) 6,315 were owned.                   A summary of the leased and owned vehicles operated by each department named in the Honourable Member's questions is provided at Attachment A.                 (2) A breakdown by make and model of the leased and owned vehicles operated by each department named in the Honourable Member's questions is provided at Attachment B.                   Departments take into account the Australian Government Fleet Vehicle Selection Policy which requires that:                 When selecting passenger vehicles within the Australian Government Fleet they must:                 be made in Australia; and                 have a five star ANCAP safety rating.                  Where no operationally suitable Australian-made passenger vehicle exists, agencies must provide a business case for the Chief Executive or their delegate's approval detailing the operational requirements that precludes the selection of an Australian-made passenger vehicle.                   When considering an imported passenger vehicle some factors that may not be considered operational requirements include:                 vehicles with similar size, load capacity and ground clearance to an Australian-made passenger vehicle;                 environmental considerations, such as fuel efficiency; and                 cost of the vehicle.                 As at 30 June 2012 Australian-made vehicles compromised 62.00% of the Commonwealth passenger fleet.                 When selecting passenger vehicles, agencies should have close regard to the Government's Green Car Challenge which states that by 2020, 50 percent of the Government fleet's passenger vehicles will be Australian-made, value for money, environmentally friendly cars.                   Light Commercial Vehicles (i.e. commercial vehicles with a Gross Vehicle Mass (GVM) of less than 3.5 tonnes) should be Australian-made or sourced from an Australian manufacturer unless no operationally suitable alternative exists.                 From 1 July 2012, light commercial vehicles are required to have a minimum four star ANCAP safety rating [subject to fit for purpose and/or operational requirements]. During vehicle selection, agencies should have regard to a vehicle's environmental performance as a means of distinguishing between functionally similar vehicles.                 (3) The Department of Defence advised that the costs (GST exclusive) of its owned commercial vehicle fleet for the financial years 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 were:                                   (3) (a) (ii), (3) (b) (ii) and (3) (c) (ii) In relation to the leased and owned fleet (excluding the Defence-owned commercial vehicle fleet) annual lease costs (GST exclusive) for the financial years 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 are provided in the table below.                  The costs for scheduled vehicle maintenance are generally included as a component of the total monthly lease charge. The maintenance-inclusive lease charge has been reported under 'Total Lease Costs'.                 The Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government was established following the 2010 federal election. As a consequence, no costs are reported for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 financial years.                 Following a departmental restructure, reporting for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for the 2011-12 financial year has been altered to include vehicles operated by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.                                   (3) (a) (iii), (3) (b) (iii) and (3) (c) (iii) The Australian Government makes, on average, 300,000 fuel purchases each financial year. The Australian Government's fleet manager, LeasePlan, has advised extrapolating the fuel purchase data against each Ministerial responsibility would be a large and unreasonable volume of information to collate.                 In relation to the leased and owned fleet (excluding the Defence-owned commercial vehicle fleet), a summary of annual fuel costs (GST exclusive) for the Ministerial responsibilities named in the question for the financial years 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 are provided in the table below.

                 I have authorised anyone occupying the position of Deputy Secretary of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to make CDDA decisions on my behalf. It is not possible to identify who will be the decision-maker for a particular matter until the matter is ready for decision. A decision-maker for the Demand Group's matter will be identified when it is ready for final decision, having regard to the availability of officers.

                 (1) (a) Contemporaneous records of the EAG meeting have not been made publicly available by the TGA.                 (b) The EAG was not asked to consider this question.                  (c) There were a number of TGA officers present at the EAG meeting. The TGA officers provided information to members of the EAG and undertook secretariat services for the EAG.                 (d) The contemporaneous records do not record evidence of BSE, penicillin or aspirin contamination.                  (2) The members of the EAG were drawn from the TGA's expert statutory committees and had expertise in clinical pharmacology, naturopathy medicine and pharmacology, toxicology, paediatrics, geriatric medicine and nutrition. They were chosen for their expertise in relation to the EAG's Terms of Reference.                 (3) (a) The TGA produced a number of audit reports into Pan Pharmaceuticals in 2003. The TGA has not made these reports publicly available.                  (b) The audit report dated 27 April 2003 noted that certain batches of finished product used chondroitin sulphate from bovine cartilage, rather than from shark cartilage as specified in the master formula and on the finished product label. Evidence of BSE contamination is not recorded.                  The audit report further noted concerns about cleaning validation and the fact that non-dedicated filter socks were shared with the antibiotic Doxycycline. Evidence of penicillin or aspirin contamination is not recorded.                  (4) The TGA decision in April 2003 to require a mandatory consumer level recall of Pan Pharmaceutical's sponsored products did not extend to its exported products. However, the TGA:                 directed Pan Pharmaceuticals to advise all distributors/suppliers/customs clearing and forwarding agents etc in the overseas countries to which Pan Pharmaceuticals had exported its 'export only' medicines which were cancelled from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) in April 2003;                 directed Pan Pharmaceuticals to provide to the TGA the complete list of all persons notified as per point 1 above; and                 notified all overseas health authorities whose countries were likely to have received Pan Pharmaceuticals 'export-only' products manufactured since 1 May 2002. The TGA provided lists to these countries containing the names of products that the TGA had approved for export-only or for which it had issued Certificates of Pharmaceutical Product. The letters sent to these countries by the TGA advised of the situation in Australia and the regulatory action the TGA was taking.                  (5) (a) Medicines are entered on the ARTG by sponsor name not by manufacturer. Frequently, sponsors will list a number of companies as possible manufacturers of their listed or registered medicine. The sponsor is not required as a matter of course to inform the TGA about which of those companies is responsible for the manufacture of any particular batch of the registered or listed medicine.                  In the month of April 2003 there were a total of 870 adverse drug reaction reports lodged with the TGA, relating to a number of different products. Apart from the travel sickness medicine Travacalm (which was known to have been manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals), for the reasons described above, it is not reasonably practicable from the information currently available to ascertain if any of these products were manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals or by other manufacturers.                 (b) In the month of April 2003 there were 12 adverse drug reaction reports lodged with the TGA concerning Travacalm.                 (c) The TGA did not receive any advice that Pan Pharmaceuticals products exported to overseas countries in April 2003 were causing illness or adverse reactions at that time. Adverse reactions from products listed on the ARTG as 'export only' are not generally reported to the TGA. Adverse events concerning products exported from Australia are generally reported to the health authority of the importing country.                  (6) The data required to answer this question is not available without the expenditure of significant resources.                  (7) The TGA did not test any products sponsored by Pan Pharmaceuticals that were cancelled from the ARTG in April 2003 and were the subject of a TGA decision to require the company to undertake a mandatory consumer level recall.                 (8) (a) The TGA conducted an audit of Pan Pharmaceuticals on 30 April and 1 May 2002 ('the 2002 audit'). The report of this audit was on the relevant TGA file and was available to the TGA auditors who conducted the April 2003 inspection.                 (b) The 2002 audit used the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Therapeutic Goods  -  Medicinal Products (August 1990) (the 1990 Code). The April 2003 audit of Pan Pharmaceuticals used the 1990 Code and the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products dated 16 August 2002 (the 2002 Code).                  The audit report dated 27 April 2003 states:                 'Each of the requirements of the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products dated 16 August 2002:                 identified in this GMP Audit Report as having been breached by the company, and                 identified as a deficiency;                 can be correlated with corresponding requirements of the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Therapeutic Goods  -  Medicinal Products (August 1990).'                 (c) The 2002 audit was a 2-day audit that found 10 'significant' (a term used at that time that encompassed the scope of what became 'critical' and 'major' under the 2002 Code) deficiencies. The April 2003 audit was significantly longer (8 days) and found 9 'critical' deficiencies, 32 'major deficiencies' and 1 'minor deficiency'.                 (9) (a) From 28 August 2002 to 28 August 2003 manufacturers could comply with either the 1990 Code or the 2002 Code.                 (b) The April 2003 audit of Pan Pharmaceuticals used the 2002 Code, and as noted in the answer to Question 8 above was correlated with corresponding requirements of the 1990 Code.                  (c) By instrument dated 20 August 2002, gazetted on 28 August 2002, the delegate of the Minister, acting under subsection 36(1) of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, determined that medicines must be manufactured in compliance with the 2002 Code. This determination provided for a 12 month transition period during which time manufacturers could comply with either the 1990 Code or the 2002 Code. On 28 August 2003 the 2002 Code became the sole mandatory standard.                 (10) It would require a significant expenditure of resources to review the information and advice obtained and considered by the TGA (in the period during which the audit inspections were undertaken and reports written) to determine (a) whether it came from companies or individuals (other than employees and executives of Pan Pharmaceuticals) and (b) whether it was about Pan Pharmaceuticals' products.                  (11) The manner and conditions of settlement varied as follows:                 (a) No formal settlement agreement or deed was entered into and no admission of liability clause was agreed. The conditions of settlement were contained in Short Minutes of Order to which the Commonwealth consented. Refer to attachment A. The settlement figure was $55,000,000.                  (b) The conditions of settlement were contained in Settlement and Release Deed between the Pharm-A-Care class action participants, the Commonwealth and 5 individuals, without admission of liability. A copy setting out the terms of the settlement is attached. Refer to attachment B. The settlement figure was $67,500,000.                  (c) The conditions of settlement were contained in Settlement and Release Deed between Markethaven, the Commonwealth and 2 individuals, without admission of liability. A copy setting out the terms of the settlement is attached. Refer to attachment C. The settlement figure was $550,000. This was not a class action.                  (d) The conditions of settlement were contained in Settlement and Release Deed between the various Vita Health companies, the Commonwealth and 5 individuals, without admission of liability. A copy setting out the terms of the settlement is attached. Refer to attachment D. The settlement figure was $5,000,000. This was not a class action.                   Copies of Attachments A, B, C and D can be obtain from the House of Representatives Table Office.

                  Prior to its passage through Parliament on 29 June 2012, the Stronger Futures legislation was the subject of extensive Parliamentary scrutiny. In late November 2011, the legislation was referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee (the Senate Committee). The Senate Committee received more than 450 submissions and conducted hearings in Canberra and the Northern Territory, including in two remote communities.                  The National Congress of Australia's First Peoples appeared before the Senate Committee and made a submission. Many other human rights and public advocacy bodies, such as the Australian Human Rights Commission, also used the Senate Committee's processes to make submissions and advocate their views on the legislation.                  Since the Government released the Stronger Futures discussion paper in June 2011, the Government has been through a genuine process of consultation with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.                 The Government has held whole-of-community meetings in approximately 100 communities and town camps, public meetings in major towns, as well as hundreds of less formal discussions in communities.                 On 14 March 2012, the Senate Committee reported with a number of recommendations to amend the legislation, which the Government adopted and which resulted in amendments to the legislation.                 The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills also examined the Stronger Futures legislation and reported on 29 February 2012.                  On 28 May 2012, Senator Rachel Siewert wrote to me suggesting that I refer the Stronger Futures Bills to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights under section 7(c) of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011.  On 28 June 2012, I responded to Senator Siewert's letter indicating that given the level of parliamentary scrutiny and debate that had already occurred in relation to the legislation, further scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee was not necessary.                  I am aware that on 20 June 2012, the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, Mr Harry Jenkins MP, wrote to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Jenny Macklin MP, inviting the Minister to provide the Committee with an assessment of the policy objectives of the Bills against human rights.                  The Minister responded on 28 June 2012 detailing information on how the Government had taken its human rights obligations into consideration in the development of the Stronger Futures policy. The Minister further detailed the significant level of parliamentary and public scrutiny that the Bills had already received, informing the Committee that the Bills provided for a number of public, independent reviews and reports on the measures from two years after the legislation commences and enclosing assessments of the policy objectives of the Bills with human rights. A copy of this response was published on the Committee's website.

                  The Australian Federal Police (AFP) did not brief me or other Ministers on the details of this investigation before the program went to air.                 The AFP provides me with general briefings on operations but does not provide specific details of these investigations.                 When I was appointed Minister for Home Affairs, I sought the advice of the Commissioner of the AFP on operational briefings.                 His strong advice was that the AFP should not brief me on details of on-going operations because of the need for a high degree of operational security and the statutory independence of the AFP's role.                 I accepted the Commissioner's prudent advice.

                 (1) (a) During the period 1 June 2011 to 31 May 2012 the Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) received 8,188 applications for exemptions under section 19AB(3) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act).                  (b) During this period, the Department granted 7,004 exemptions under section 19AB(3) of the Act.                  (c) As each application for an exemption under section 19AB(3) of the Act is assessed individually and in accordance with the provisions set out within the Section 19AB Guidelines, the Department does not keep statistics on the average processing times for exemptions. However all exemption applications have been processed within the statutory timeframe of 28 days from the date that the application is received by the Department.                  (2) For the purpose of assessing applications for exemptions under the spousal provisions of clause 5.6 of the Guidelines for section 19AB of the Act,  only those applicants who are the spouses of certain types of migrants (i.e. migrants skilled in occupations on the Migration Occupations Demand/Skilled Occupation List) may be assessed under the spousal provision (along with the spouses of medical practitioners not subject to 19AB or who have been granted an exemption). Accordingly, when assessing applications for exemptions under the spousal provisions, persons who have not been granted a general skilled migration Visa by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship are not considered to have migrated to Australia.                  (3) Applications for exemptions under section 19AB(3) of the Act are assessed by the Minister for Health's delegate. The Minister's delegate may seek legal advice to assist in the assessment of applications for an exemption under section 19AB(3) of the Act where necessary.                  (4) Applications for exemptions under the spousal provisions of clause 5.6 of the Section 19AB Guidelines are assessed by the Minister's delegate at the Department. The Minister's delegate may seek legal advice to assist in the assessment of applications for an exemption under Clause 5.6 where necessary.                  (5) Yes.                  (6) Yes.                  (7) No                 (8) The Section 19AB Guidelines are currently being reviewed by the Department.

                 I note the Discussion paper on the late effects of polio/post-polio syndrome prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, and its recommendations. I would like to acknowledge the work of the Committee in highlighting this important health issue.                  Recommendation 3 of the paper calls on Medicare Locals to engage with Polio Australia and other stakeholders to help raise awareness of the late effects of polio / post-polio syndrome.                  Medicare Locals are a nation-wide network of 61 primary health care organisations, and operate as health system planners at the regional level. They have primary responsibility for identifying the health care needs of their local populations, based on a comprehensive needs assessment process involving public and stakeholder consultation, and coordinating activities to address identified service gaps. Medicare Locals are also responsible for ensuring that primary health care works for the whole of the local community, including through addressing the needs of people affected by the late effects of polio/ post-polio syndrome.                 Community members, including post-polio syndrome patients, their families and their carers, are encouraged to engage with their Medicare Local to ensure that their specific health care needs can be better understood, and appropriately addressed, by the Medicare Local.                 The Medicare Local network is well placed to support clinicians, service providers and peak bodies in improving patient care. An example of how this can be achieved is through Medicare Locals supporting local primary health care providers to participate in continuing professional development activities.                 The Government urges peak stakeholder groups such as Polio Australia to engage with the Australian Medicare Local Alliance (AML Alliance), as the national body for Medicare Locals, to jointly consider options for how the Medicare Local network can help to address the impacts of the late effects of polio / post-polio syndrome, in collaboration with local primary health care service providers and practitioners.

                   (1                   )                  Note: Figures provided in the above table are indicative and do not capture all customer demand. These figures represent those customers that had a more complex interaction with a customer service officer. It should be noted that over this period the sites queuing strategies and recording practices have changed several times. In particular, for the 2010-11 financial year, changes to front-of-house practices led to the number of contacts not being recorded for part of the year and the results are not accurate. The recording of contact numbers resumed in 2011-12. Therefore the yearly figures are not comparable and are a guide only.                    The Department is unable to provide the number of referrals of customers between the Revesby and Bankstown sites as this information is not collected.                    (2                   )                    The premises are leased by the Commonwealth.                   (a)                    The lease expires on 2 December 2013.                   (b)                    The annual cost of the lease, including rent and outgoings, is $282,846 GST exclusive.                   (c)                    There are no further lease options available.                   (3                   )                    The size of the tenancy is 1,012 square metres and approximately 20% of space is used for public enquiries and front counter services.                   (4                   )                    There are 10 car parking spots included in the lease and these are not available to the public. They are primarily used for Commonwealth fleet vehicles.                   (5                   )                    Revesby Service Centre has recently had old Centrelink external signage decommissioned and replaced with signage for the Department of Human Services. Works were completed at this service centre on 21 June 2012 at a cost of $5,214 GST exclusive.                   (6                   )                    The carpet was last steam cleaned on 24 February 2012.                   (7                   )                    As at 18 August 2012, at the Revesby Service Centre there were two staff providing face to face services and one Team Leader, plus 52 non-customer facing Smart Centre staff providing processing services.                   The staff providing face to face services at Revesby will relocate to nearby sites; the two customer service staff have opted to move to the Bankstown site and the Team Leader is considering options on where they would like to move to. The 52 Smart Centre staff providing processing services will remain at the Revesby site.                   (8                   )                    As per the answer to part 7, as at 18 August 2012, there were two staff providing face to face services with one Team Leader at the Revesby Service Centre.

                 The objective of the Rewards for Great Teachers initiative is to improve the quality, performance and development of all teachers in Australia, in order to improve student learning outcomes. This program is about recognising and rewarding our best performing teachers and keeping them where they are most needed  -  in the classroom.                 The Australian Government acknowledges the vital role in supporting teachers that Learning Support staff provide in schools every day. Responsibility for the recruitment and employment of learning support staff rests with the states and territories and non-government education authorities.                  The Commonwealth does not provide direct funding for learning support staff, however, under the $550 million Improving Teacher Quality National Partnership, a number of states are implementing a range of reforms that are focused on learning support staff.                  In New South Wales 166 paraprofessional support positions have been created to support teachers to focus on student learning. These paraprofessionals are employed in a variety of roles including supporting literacy and numeracy programs, developing and implementing data support and management systems, working as Aboriginal Education Assistants and providing general in-classroom support.                 In Queensland, the Department of Education and Training will create an extra 500 full-time equivalent teacher aide positions, which will provide extra assistance every week. It will also expand opportunities for Indigenous staff to gain nationally recognised qualifications through the enhancement of the Remote Area Teacher Education Program (RATEP). RATEP will provide additional opportunities for Indigenous education workers to gain qualifications at a Certificate III, IV and Diploma level.                  In Western Australia, the Department of Education and Training is facilitating the up skilling of over 150 education assistants and has established a new Senior Learning Assistant (SLA) level to improve career paths. The Department is also supporting Aboriginal and Islander Education Officers (AIEOs) and Aboriginal Teaching Assistants to be up skilled. Nearly 50 AIEOs completed Certificate III or Certificate IV qualifications in 2011.                  In South Australia a major component of the strategy to improve in-school support for teachers and leaders in disadvantaged schools in all sectors has been to increase the skills of school support staff through accredited learning and work redesign. School Support Officers and Aboriginal Community Education Officers are able to choose from a range of accredited skill sets and certificates in finance, in education support, and in government services. Aboriginal Community Education Officers are also able to participate in a certificate in community services work.                  In the Northern Territory the Inclusive Leadership model is being implemented in 22 large, very remote government and non-government schools. It is allowing these schools to determine the most appropriate way to enhance engagement with local community members. Some models being implemented include cultural advisors and local staff that support cultural programs, staff cultural competence and promote community engagement with school.

Post budget analysis has shown that it is more appropriate for Army to retain the full M1A1 Abrams Tank capability by placing an additional 22 M113AS4 Armoured Vehicles into storage, for a revised total of 122.                 (4) (a) to (d) and (5)                    The Army reserve training salaries budget provides funding for Army reservists, covering both salary and allowance payments                   .                    The 2012-13 Army internal budget allocation process has not yet been finalised.                    Functional commands have been allocated their budgets for FY12/13.                   However,                   consistent with                   the process in previous years, the 2012-13 Army internal budget allocation process down to Division, Brigade and Unit level                   remains ongoing.                   The budget is a dynamic process, which provides Army with sufficient flexibility to manage                   resources in an efficient manner                   to deliver capability to Government in accordance with national security priorities                   .                    This process covers the full range of Army activities, including funding for Army Reserve Training Days.                   Accordingly, the budget for Army Reserve Training Days for all Reserve Units remains under consideration                   and has not been finalised.                   Unit commanders are being consulted as part of the current budget allocation process.                   Prioritisation of Defence expenditure                   is designed to                   maximise the delivery of core Defence capabilities.                   Reservists and their permanent colleagues are employed                   as a total force to deliver core capabilities to the Australian Defence Force                   .                    Reservists will continue to                   make fundamental contributions to capability                   on                   operational deployments such as                   Operation Anode and                   Operation Astute                   .                    They will also                   be resourced to enable them to maintain a level of                   individual readiness to                   undertake allocated tasks, such as those performed during                   OP Flood Assist/Op                   Fire Assist.

                 1. (a) &amp; (b) Army  -  Functional commands have been allocated their budgets for FY12/13. However, as with previous years, the 2012-13 Army internal budget allocation process down to Division, Brigade and Unit level remains ongoing.                 The budget is a dynamic process, which provides Army with sufficient flexibility to manage resources in an efficient manner to deliver capability to Government in accordance with national security priorities.                  Army is committed to fiscal responsibility and will therefore continuously review and adjust resource allocations against priorities. Accordingly, resource allocations and budgets for Reserve Units remain under consideration. Army will continue to ensure that Reservists deploying on exercises and operations are trained and equipped as required. Unit commanders continue to be consulted throughout the entirety of the budget cycle.                  Reservists and their permanent colleagues are employed as a total force to deliver core capabilities to the Australian Defence Force. Reservists will continue to make fundamental contributions to capability on operational deployments such as Operation Anode and Operation Astute. They will also be resourced to enable them to maintain a level of individual readiness to undertake allocated tasks, such as those performed during OP Flood Assist/Op Fire Assist.                 RAAF/Navy - Reserve personnel in the Navy and Royal Australian Air Force are integrated into regular units, as part of one total force to deliver required capabilities to the ADF and the Australian people. Therefore, RAAF and Navy Reservists will continue to contribute to the capability of that total force based on the necessity to meet national security requirements.                    As the Prime Minister and I stated on 3 May 2012, the 2013 Defence White Paper will be delivered in the first half of 2013.                    The Minister for Defence Materiel and I jointly released the 2012 Defence Capability Plan on 10 July 2012.

(b) Based on 2007 Defence Census data there are approximately 16,000 dependants living in Trial regions as follows:                 Singleton = 297 Dependants;                 Pilbara Region = 55 Dependants;                 Sale = 551 Dependants;                 Cairns (including Weipa, Mt Isa and Thursday Island) = 719 Dependants;                 Katherine =  1054 Dependants;                 Townsville = 6044 Dependants;                 Darwin (including Alice Springs, Nhulunbuy, and Kununurra and Broome) = 5554 Dependants; and                 Puckapunyal = 1537 Dependants.                 (c) The estimated proportion of registered dependants in each region (as at 20 June 2012) based on the 2007 Defence census data is:                 Singleton = 47 per cent                 Pilbara Region = 73 per cent                 Sale = 74 per cent                 Cairns (including Weipa, Mt Isa and Thursday Island) = 61 per cent                 Katherine =  40 per cent                 Townsville = 34 per cent                 Darwin (including Alice Springs, Nhulunbuy, and Kununurra and Broome = 31 per cent                 Puckapunyal = 29 per cent                 (2) (a) Based on the 2007 Defence Census there are approximately 70,000 dependants of permanent ADF members.                 As at 20 June 2012 there are currently 5,630 dependants registered for the Trial.                 Based on the 2007 Defence Census there are an estimated 54,189 dependants residing in areas not covered by the Trial.                 (3)Yes, the views of Defence families not residing in Trial regions have been represented in every Defence Attitude Survey since 2008 which contains specific questions relating to the ADF Family Health Trial. Additionally, feedback from families not residing in Trial regions has been sought and included in various Trial evaluation activities such as online surveys as well as anecdotal feedback collected throughout the Trial period.                 (4)Subject to Government approval the rollout of a National ADF Family Health Program is planned for 1 July 2013.                 (5) Ongoing funding for the program is in the Defence budget.                 (6)(a)   The National ADF Family Health Program will enable all ADF dependants throughout Australia to participate.                 (b)  Based on the 2007 Defence Census there are approximately 70,000 dependants of permanent ADF members that will be covered by the National ADF Family Health Program.                  (c)  100% of ADF Dependants residing in Australia will be eligible to enrol in the National ADF Family Health Program.                 (7)(a)  The budget for ADF Family Health for Financial Year 2012-13 is $10m.                   (b)  The current estimate is approximately $60 million per year.                  (8) The trial was evaluated at the end of 2011 in preparation for a national rollout of this access to healthcare Australia wide in 2012-13. Take up of the services on offer was assessed as only in the order of 30 per cent of eligible participants. The full rollout has been deferred to enable further assessment of the basis for the low take up rate. The resulting savings of $50 million form part of the overall Defence Budget savings for 2012-13.

                 The next-generation fixed wireless and satellite networks to be delivered to those outside the fibre footprint are being engineered to deliver high-speed broadband to regional and remote communities. These services are expected to be the equivalent of, or better than, current ADSL services.                 NBN Co will continue to upgrade its fixed wireless and satellite networks, including deploying commercial grade services over the long term satellite service and through other technological improvements, delivering further services of importance to regional and remote Australia.                 The government established the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency (TUSMA) on 1 July 2012 to ensure the ongoing provision of basic consumer safeguards in the transition to the NBN and beyond. Under agreements reached between Telstra and the Commonwealth, and administered by TUSMA, Telstra will have a contractual obligation to maintain the copper network and provide voice-only services to locations outside the fibre footprint for a period of 20 years from 1 July 2012 with a review into these arrangements scheduled to occur in 2018. NBN Co's 2012-15 Corporate Plan highlights that it will be providing 100 per cent of Australian premises with access to high-speed broadband by June 2021 while the fixed wireless and long term satellite service will be in place over 2015.                  The Government's revised telecommunications arrangements and the rollout of the NBN fixed wireless and satellite services do not place any impediment on residents retaining their current copper-based services outside the footprint. The specific services offered will be a matter for retail service providers.

                 The Australian Government considers the United Kingdom (UK) Government's policy of not indexing pensions in most Commonwealth countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, where the majority of its expatriate pensioners reside, to be unfair and discriminatory. The Government strongly supports the efforts of UK pensioners seeking equal treatment on the indexation issue. All UK pensioners paid their contributions under the same rules and should be paid their pensions under equal conditions.                 Prior to the media report cited by the honourable member, the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Jenny Macklin MP, issued a statement on 21 May 2012 that also appeared in the online edition of the The Telegraph, reiterating that the Government considers the indexation policy to be unfair and discriminatory and urging her UK counterparts to look at options for resolving this longstanding issue.                  Minister Macklin recently met with her UK counterpart, the Rt Hon Iain Duncan Smith MP and reiterated the Government's views on the indexation issue. In this context, the UK Government has agreed to an officials dialogue with Australia, including examination of options for indexation.                 On previous occasions when Government Ministers have approached UK Government Ministers on the indexation issue, the consistent message is that the indexation issue is not open for negotiation due to concerns about the cost to the UK Government. I understand the Canadian Government has made similar approaches on this issue and has been given the same response.                 I note that there have been requests that Canada and Australia work together on this issue. The Government will consider the possibility of joint action with other affected countries, such as Canada, if an opportunity arises. In the meantime, the Government will continue to press the UK Government on this issue, whenever appropriate.

                 Telstra is a private company and therefore is under no obligation to disclose commercial information to the department about its performance unless it is required to do so by legislation or legislative instrument.                  Telstra provided the department with the following response to this question:                 'The extensive information sought is not readily available as Telstra does not track the performance of its fixed line network against the large number of municipal shires and individual cities in Australia.                  Telstra also considers its performance at such very low levels of disaggregation to be commercially sensitive information, as there is likely to be a variation in performance between the many regions within a state. This is due to the variation in the density of fixed line services (and the subsequent impact on the level of reported faults); the classification of Telstra exchange service areas within a region into urban, rural or remote; and the distances that Telstra technicians must travel to attend individual faults. Telstra also manages its performance on a state/national basis, as the impact of seasonal weather events (and the subsequent increase in fault levels) will require Telstra to temporarily relocate field staff from one state to another in order to manage the increased workload.                 In terms of data that is readily available to address Ms Marino's questions, Telstra considers the information on its website regarding Network Reliability Framework (NRF) performance to be the most suitable data on which to base a response. The Shires of Capel, Dardanup and Harvey, and the cities of Bunbury and Busselton, fall within the NRF geographic area of Western Australia South Western Region.'                  According to Telstra's website, the percentage of Customer Service Guarantee (CSG) services with no faults for the South Western region of Western Australia for May 2012, the latest month for which Telstra provides data, was 98.54. This measure describes the percentage of CSG services that were fault free for this region. The CSG is a regulated performance standard that sets down maximum timeframes for the connection and rectification of fixed line services for residential and small business customers.                 The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) publication, Telecommunications (fixed-line) performance bulletin 2010-11: Data tables, provides NRF performance data on an annual basis for Western Australia South Western Region. According to the ACMA, the annual average percentage of CSG services without a fault for 2007-08 was 98.86, for 2008-09 it was 98.62, for 2009-10 it was 98.50 and for 2010-11 it was 98.79.

                 The Foreign Investment Review Board's Annual Reports provide data on proposed investment into Australia for each financial year. Table 2.10 provides a state and territory distribution of proposed investment in the real estate sector broken down by the number and value of the approvals. The Annual Reports are available at: http://www.firb.gov.au/content/publications.asp?NavID=5. It is important to note that the data contained in the Annual Reports is based on investor intentions and not actual purchases.                 Specific investment information disaggregated by suburb is not available, reflecting the need to protect the commercial interests and privacy of individual investors. It would also involve significant work to produce the information sought.

                 As emissions from generating electricity will fall under the cap of Australia's emissions trading scheme (ETS), there will be no net additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from the use of network termination devices once the National Broadband Network has been rolled out.                 This demonstrates the value of an ETS as a mechanism that allows the Government to set a quantitative emissions target for the entire economy and have certainty of delivering on that target.                 Under Australia's ETS, commencing in 2015-16, the Government will set a cap on greenhouse gas emissions (including CO2) from covered sectors of the Australian economy and issue permits up to that cap. Covered entities will be required to surrender one permit for every tonne of CO2 they emit. Because the total number of permits cannot exceed the cap, any emissions increases in one sector of the economy must be offset by emissions reductions elsewhere, or through the purchase of an offset unit. This results in net emissions from covered sectors being limited to the level of the cap.

                 (1) (a) The budget for 2011-12 for the Australian Army History Unit (AAHU) was $2.7 million.                  (b) The budget for 2012-13 for the AAHU is $1.3 million.                 (2) (a) The decrease in funding has been achieved through some reduction in the publishing program, introducing e-book technology and deferring this year's Chief of Army History Conference. This will now be a biennial conference and offset the biennial Land Warfare Conference.                  (b) No services will be affected. AAHU is primarily tasked with producing military historical analysis in support of Army's modernisation. This support will continue. In addition, the budget allocation will enable the Army's substantial historical collection to be maintained and accessible to visitors from within the Australian Defence Force and the wider public. The AAHU will also continue providing support to the Capability and Technology Management College.                 (c) (d) The military history publishing program has been reduced, but will continue to produce quality Australian military history titles. The only publications that were supplied free to Defence members were The Australian Army Campaign Series.                  This will now be produced via e-books to improve distribution and access to all serving members online via the Army's online learning portal, i-Army.

                 (1) All persons in immigration detention are able to apply for, or be offered the opportunity to participate in, excursions. Principles underpinning this policy are that persons in immigration detention are treated fairly and reasonably within the law and that conditions of detention will ensure the inherent dignity of the human person.                 An excursion cannot proceed without the express approval of the Regional Manager or their nominated delegate and the Department reserves the right to cancel or postpone excursions. Factors for the Regional Manager to consider include, but are not limited to, the following:                 availability of Detention Services Provider staff to escort the persons in immigration detention on the excursion;                 current security, site and flight risk assessments;                 advice from medical professionals who may be treating the person in immigration detention; and                 the individual's personal circumstances (for example, the requested visit may be to a close family member in hospital).                 In determining whether a 'high risk' client will be able to attend a visit to a home, consideration is given to assessing risk in conformity with the Australian Risk Management Standard (ASNZ s4360:2004) and the Department's own risk management framework. This includes the departmental risk assessment matrix which helps departmental officers and detention service providers make decisions which are in line with the Department's obligations to protect the Australian community and staff and as part of its duty of care to the client and other detainees.                 (2) The information requested is not held on the Department's electronic data management systems. Obtaining this information would be a resource intensive exercise involving manual extraction of data from hard copy files. As such the Department is not able to provide a response to this question.

                 (a) and (b) The method of costing Army platforms differs by capability. Army aviation platforms are costed by the hour. Army land platforms are costed by the kilometre. There is also a static cost for certain Army land platforms. This static cost is based on the cost to maintain the equipment without operating it.                 In addition, the costs provided in this response are drawn from the Defence Financial Manual Volume 4, which is currently under review. It is assessed that these costs will change once reviewed, most notably the helicopter costs, as the data for capabilities such as ARH Tiger and MRH-90 matures.                  Noting this, the current average cost of Army platforms is estimated as follows:                  Land platform static capability costs (not including crew):                 (i) M777 155 millimetre Light Weight Towed Howitzer: $117.42 per day;                 (ii) Australian Light Armoured Vehicle: $1,138.25 per day;                 (iii) Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle: $398.68 per day;                 (iv) M1A1 Abrams Tank: $1,260.69 per day; and                 (v) M113AS4 Armoured Personnel Carrier: $201.78 per day.                  Land platform operating costs (including crew):                 (i) Australian Light Armoured Vehicle: $52.05 per kilometre;                  (ii) Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle: $2.66 per kilometre;                  (iii) G Wagon: $0.28 per kilometre;                  (iv) M1A1 Abrams Tank: $213.99 per kilometre; and                 (v) M113AS4 Armoured Personnel Carrier: $49.06 per kilometre.                  Aviation platform operating costs (including aircrew for helicopters):                 (i) ARH Tiger: $17,451 per hour;                  (ii) MRH-90: $15,575 per hour;                 (iii) S-70A9 Black Hawk: $15,186 per hour;                 (iv) CH-47 Chinook: $15,992 per hour;                 (v) B-206 Kiowa: $2,063 per hour;                 (vi) Scan Eagle UAV: $3,549 per hour (based on 7000 hours per year);                 (vii) Shadow 200 UAV: $2,370 per hour (based on 7920 hours per year); and                 (viii) Heron UAV: $12,535 per hour.                 Please note that the static cost for G Wagon and the operating cost for M777 are not available as they have both been recently introduced into service and the data to quantify these costs has not yet been captured.                  The daily cost for land vehicle platforms is calculated from the kilometres driven in a single day. If a vehicle sits static for a day, then the static operating cost is used. If a vehicle is driven to a location and then left static for a period, of 24 hours or part thereof, the cost is calculated by adding the static capability cost and the operating cost.                 The daily costs for aviation platforms are calculated by multiplying the hourly cost by the hours flown that day.                 All costs detailed are the direct operating costs to Army. This includes petrol, oil, lubricants, forecasted maintenance and crew (where specified). These costs do not include procurement, overheads, depreciation and infrastructure costs.                  The UAV costs are based on the hours flown in Financial Year 2011/12 for Scan Eagle (historical) and allocated in Financial Year 2012/13 for Shadow (allocated) as costs vary depending on hours flown. These years represent the greatest rate of effort for scan eagle and the predicted yearly rate of effort for Shadow. With UAVs, the more hours flown, the less expensive they are to operate per hour as there is a fixed component to the cost of flying UAVs.

                 (1) (a) and (b) The table below provides the cost to Defence for Royal Australian Air Force platforms.                  The basis is the cash cost (direct cost) incurred by Defence, including sustainment costs, fuel, and aircrew salary, allowances and superannuation.                  Unless otherwise stated, the hourly cost rates used are those published in Finance Manual Volume 4 (FINMAN 4).                 The daily cost to Defence is calculated as the hourly cost rate multiplied by the total hours flown in the corresponding financial year (defined as the achieved 'rate of effort'), divided by 365 days.                 The hourly cost to Defence is the specified hourly cost rate.

                 (a) and (b) The table below provides the daily and hourly cost to Defence for Royal Australian Navy vessels.                 The daily and hourly cost of each Navy vessel is based on the 2011-12 direct cash costs incurred by Defence by Navy Platform, which includes: sustainment, fuel, salary, allowances and superannuation.                   The average daily cost per vessel has been calculated by dividing the annual cost for each Platform Class by the number of vessels, and then dividing that cost by 365 days (except for HMAS Choules).                   The average hourly cost per vessel has been calculated by dividing the average daily cost by 24.                 It should be noted that this method of calculating a hourly rate per vessel does not differentiate between a vessel at sea or a vessel alongside in harbour  -  it is an average.  Of course, in reality, a fully crewed ship at sea costs Navy substantially more per hour that those alongside in harbour.

                 The decision to declare the Syrian Charge d'Affaires, Mr Jawdat Ali, persona non grata applied to family members because the diplomatic visas for family members are tied to that of the officer.                  The decision was made by the Australian Government as an effort to convey to Damascus Australia's grave concerns regarding the Haoula massacre and the Assad regime's lack of commitment to the ceasefire and the Joint Special Envoy's six-point peace plan.

                 (1) (a) Information on the schedule, cost and capability of Defence Capability Plan projects is available in the Public Defence Capability Plan which was released on 10 July 2012.                 The Government remains committed to the core capabilities outlined in the 2009 Defence White Paper, including:                 the Joint Strike Fighter;                  the replacement for the Caribou aircraft;                  upgrades to Orion maritime patrol aircraft; and                  upgrades to C-130J aircraft;                  the Growler Airborne Electronic Attack capability.                  Of the DCP projects underpinning the 2009 White Paper, 10 have been removed, with those being overtaken by related projects or replaced by newer technologies.                 A range of lower-priority capability projects will be deferred.                 Other major and minor capability and facility programs will be subject to re-scoping.                 (b) Information on the cost, capability and schedule of the top 30 projects by expenditure in the Approved Major Capital Equipment Program is included in the Defence Portfolio Budget Statements 2012-13.                  (c) Information on the progress and cost of scope of projects in the Approved Major Capital Facilities Program is included in the Defence Portfolio Budget Statements 2012-13.                 (2) Costs 'absorbed' by Defence cover a wide range of activities conducted within the funding provided to Defence by Government without supplementation. This includes new measures, priorities and activities not previously identified. For example, in the 2012-13 Budget, Defence reallocated and reprioritised $2.9 billion to meet a range of new cost pressures which emerged across the portfolio as outlined at Page 18 of the Defence Portfolio Budget Statements 2012-13.                 Providing a full list of all 'absorbed' measures would involve an unreasonable diversion of Defence resources.                 (3) (a) and (b) As reported in the Defence Annual Report 2010-11 and contrary to the Australian Strategy Policy Institute's 2012-13 Cost of Defence Brief, Defence achieved in excess of its SRP savings target for 2010-11. Defence's SRP savings target for 2010-11 was $1,016 million and savings achievement was $1,064 million. Some of the key areas where cost reductions were achieved include:                  upgrading and consolidating Defence's ageing Information and Communications;                 Technology (ICT) infrastructure;                 conversion of military and contract positions into Australian Public Service (APS) positions;                 improved demand management of travel, training, professional services and garrison support;                 streamlining the maintenance of military equipment;                 making contract improvements across a range of support and sustainment services; and                 changes in the way that financial risk is managed.                 (4) (a) With an expected full achievement of $1,284 million in Financial Year 2011-12, to date Defence has achieved a total of $3,370 million in cost reduction savings.                  As reported on page 6 of the Defence Annual Report 2010-11 the achievement for Financial Year 2009-2010 was $1,022 million.                 As reported on page 8 of the Defence Annual Report 2010-11 the achievement for Financial Year 2010-2011 was $1,064 million.                 The expected achievement for Financial Year 2011-2012 is $1,284 million. This will be reported in the Defence Annual Report 2011-12.                 (b) and (c) The savings made under the SRP represent a reallocation of funds away from Group and Service operating and sustainment budgets to the core capabilities identified in the White Paper. Savings from cost reduction's will be reinvested to order to deliver Force 2030. Approximately $18.2 billion will go towards new capital equipment and approximately $2.4billion for the remediation of areas of under investment such as estate, ICT and Logistics.                 (5) The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Materiel meet regularly with defence industry companies and industry groups to discuss Defence industry and acquisition matters.                  (6) As part of the 2012-13 budget process Defence undertook analysis of reducing expenditure in support of the Government's fiscal strategy.                  (7) The Strategic Reform Program was developed with the purpose of increasing the efficiency and productivity in Defence. The savings achieved under the SRP for 2011-12 will be reported in the Annual Report. They are not reported on a six-monthly basis.                 Defence will further enhance productivity through the implementation of further shared services reform, tighter recruitment practices, and a prioritisation of Australian Public Service (APS) positions. This includes reductions in the growth in APS positions announced in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 Budgets.                 Defence has also been subject to a range of efficiency dividends on its non-operational, non-capability funding, which Defence has achieved through greater cost consciousness, improved economies of scale, and a prioritisation of activities.

                 (1) ADF leave has not been cut.                 (2) On 1 July 2012, Defence made changes to the recreation leave travel policy. In summary those changes were:                 Setting an upper age limit of 20. Previously there was no age limit. This age limit will not apply to trainees who remain eligible to travel up to three times a year regardless of age.                 Removal of the second recreation leave travel benefit provided to Navy members. This brings them into line with their Army and Air Force counterparts.                 Limiting the assistance to travel within Australia. Previously trainees and members undergoing training were provided with travel to overseas destinations.                 Reducing the number of times per year that members undergoing training (not trainees) can access the benefit from three to one.                  On 13 September 2012, the Government removed the age restriction that had applied to recreation leave travel since 1 July 2012.                  Since 13 September 2012, members without dependants serving in Australia have been eligible for return travel to where their nominated family lives in Australia. No age limit applies.                 In summary, the following recreation leave travel benefits apply from 13 September 2012:                 Members without dependants who are trainees are eligible for up to three return trips in a leave year. Members undergoing training are not trainees.                 Any other eligible members without dependants, including members undergoing training, are eligible for one return trip in a leave year.                 Travel assistance is for travel within Australia only.                 For responses 2a to 2e inclusive (including parts [i] and [iii]) please see the table below.                 Information is not available to answer part ii of this question.                 *The total annual cost has been calculated in FBT financial year periods for Defence personnel utilising their recreational leave travel entitlement (FBT inclusive).                 (3)For the changes made with effect Sunday 1 July 2012, the online version of PACMAN was amended and uploaded to the Defence Intranet on Monday 2 July 2012. From 21 June 2012 the actual Defence Determination that created the changes was available online.                 For the changes made on 13 September 2012, the online version of PACMAN was updated, including the Defence Determination at 1430h on 13 September 2012.                 (4)For the 1 July 2012 changes, transitional arrangements were put in place to assist members who had already made travel plans:                 If before 9 May 2012, the date the changes were announced, a member without dependants was granted a recreation leave travel benefit to travel on or after 1 July 2012, the member would continue to be eligible for that benefit. The travel must have been undertaken by 30 June 2013. The leave year for ADF members runs from 1 July to 30 June each year.                 A member without dependants may retain a benefit that had been deferred from the current leave year into the leave year commencing on 1 July 2012.                 If before 25 June 2012, a member without dependants was approved an advance of recreation leave travel from leave year 2012/13 to travel in leave year 2011/12, the member continued to be eligible for that benefit.                 (a) Travel that had been approved for a member without dependants who would have been  no longer eligible for recreation leave travel (unless the member's circumstances were included in the transitional arrangements) was to be cancelled.                  (b) The recreation leave travel benefit is a return economy class airfare from the member's posting location to the location of their nominated family. This travel should be booked by Defence in order for Defence to be able to claim back the value of the GST. So in most cases cancellation of the benefit would simply involve cancellation of the travel booking. If members were covered by the transitional arrangements, they would not have their travel cancelled nor be required to pay back the cost of the trip. A discretionary provision exists in the ADF Pay and Conditions Manual which enables approving authorities to approve payment of the reasonable costs of travel and related expenses for certain persons who would not otherwise be eligible for those benefits.                  For the changes made on 13 September 2012, the removal of the age limit is not applied retrospectively; therefore no transitional arrangements are required.                 (5) (a) and (b) Members with dependants who are accompanied at their posting location by their dependants are not entitled to any Defence funded reunion trips. Members with dependants who live at their posting location in Australia while their dependants live in another location (members with dependants (unaccompanied)) are provided with up to six reunion visits per year. This reunion travel benefit for members with dependants (unaccompanied) applies regardless of age.                 ADF members are also eligible for other forms of Defence funded travel, including remote location leave travel. These trips are not age limited and the number depends on whether or not the member is accompanied by their dependants and the grading of the remote location they are posted to.                 (6) (a)The changes relating to Mr Robert's question came into effect on 1 July 2012.                 On 13 September 2012, following the concerns raised by the Defence community and members of the public, the Government removed the age restriction that had applied to recreation leave travel since 1 July 2012.                  (b) (i) and (ii) Defence's employment offer contains a range of other benefits that assist in attracting potential recruits, and retaining serving personnel. When considering the totality of that offer, Defence is confident that it will continue to attract and retain ADF members.                 (c) (i) and (ii) No.                 (d) The policy changes of 1 July 2012, to recreation leave travel had been under consideration for some time as part of the Strategic Reform Program, Non-Equipment Procurement stream but were brought forward for inclusion as a Budget measure.                 (e) (i) and (ii) The minor savings generated from the changes to the recreation leave travel benefit will contribute to both the Strategic Reform Program and the Budget bottom line over the forward estimates to 2015/16.

                 1. As at 30 April 2012 there were 84 staff performing the heritage functions of the department. Staff heritage work on the full complement of heritage matters  -  historic, natural and Indigenous. The number of staff working in heritage over the past three years has reduced however it is not possible to indicate by how many as the structure of the organisation has changed during this period. Heritage staff numbers may vary over the estimated period in line with the forward estimates and budget parameters.                 2. The Portfolio Budget Statement reflects a one-off increase in heritage grant funding of $4 million per annum for the period 2011-12 and 2012-13. The 2013-14 forward estimate shows grant funding returning to its previous level.                 3. It is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question because the nature of each assessment varies due to complexity of the nominated matter.                 4. The Australian Heritage Council does not have a separate budget, and it is not struggling to fulfil its responsibilities. The work of Council so far during this calendar year has included: three formal meetings of Council, conducting a workshop with national experts to develop an assessment methodology for heritage aesthetics, facilitating a workshop for key stakeholders and heritage experts to develop themes for the Australian Heritage Strategy, fulfilment of statutory obligations in regard to places nominated by the public for possible inclusion in the National Heritage and Commonwealth Heritage lists, fifteen written assessments against Commonwealth Heritage criteria and one against National Heritage criteria to the minister and support for Australian Heritage Week.                 5. Yes.                 6. The Federation of Australian Historical Societies (FAHS) has received funding under the Grants to Voluntary Environment, Sustainability and Heritage Organisations (GVESHO), formerly Grants to Voluntary Environment and Heritage Organisations, since the 1999-2000 financial year.                  Over the past 5 years, FAHS has been awarded a range of funding: $17,000 in financial year 2007-08; $30,000 in financial years 2008 09, 2009-10 and 2010-11; and $23,500 in financial year 2011-12. Multi-year funding under GVESHO has only been offered on two occasions, in financial years 2004-05 and 2008-09. Multiyear funding was allocated to FAHS on both of these occasions. As funds under the program are limited, historically the majority of successful organisations receive a grant which is less than the full amount requested. Grant amounts in the 2011-12 funding round ranged from $1,300 (local organisations) to $77,000 (large state organisations).                 7. Historically the majority of successful organisations receive a grant which is less than the full amount requested as funds under the program are limited. The program follows the longstanding practice of awarding grants based on the rankings assigned to specific applications. As a result the total funding received by the heritage, environment and sustainability sectors will vary each time a competitive grants round is called.                  8. There has not been a change in the level of support awarded to national, state, regional or local eligible organisations under the program.                 9. The Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities regularly reviews its process for the administration and awarding of grants. The Grants Administration Framework is reviewed annually to ensure documentation, guidance, resources and tools are aligned with current better practice and legislative requirements. The next review is due August 2012 and is already underway to incorporate the anticipated release of the new Commonwealth Grant Guidelines scheduled for release in July 2012.

                 As at 30 June 2012, 82,138 set-top boxes had been installed under the Household Assistance Scheme.                 Also as at 30 June 2012:                 (a) and (b) the total sum spent on the scheme was approximately $42.53m GST exclusive. This includes the departmental cost of the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy for the scheme of approximately $8.68m (GST exclusive). This is under budget, and funds have been returned to the Budget.                 (c) Of the 82,138 installations, there had been 2,257 complaints lodged with the Minister's department. These complaints ranged across issues with Centrelink, service contractors, digital reception, Viewer Access Satellite Television and Household Assistance Scheme eligibility. The total represents 1.5 per cent of set-top box installations to that point in time.

                 (a) The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts published the Approved List of Insulation Products (Approved List) on 23 December 2009.                  That list was compiled using publicly available insulation product certification documentation published by accredited testing authorities and the National Association of Testing Authorities.                  (b) Under the Home Insulation Program Guidelines, installers were required to ensure that the living areas of dwellings were insulated to the minimum thermal resistance rating (Minimum R Value) required for the location of the dwelling. Installers could meet the R Value requirements by installing insulation products with a sufficiently high R Value. Alternatively, installers were able to use products with R Values less than the Minimum R Value required, if, when combined with the thermal resistance value of existing building elements and air spaces, the Total R Value for the dwelling met or exceeded the required Minimum R Value for the location.                 Certain types of products which were certified by testing authorities did not have an R Value specified. This is because for these types of products, the R Value could not be determined until after installation. These included cellulose products, where the R Value is dependent on the way the product is installed, and foil products, where the R Value is dependent on the way the product is installed and other factors.                 Accordingly, products on the Approved List which had an R Value lower than R3.5, or an R Value shown as 'N/A', may have been used in the Sydney area.

                 (1) The slowing of the growth in the aid program to 0.5 per cent of GNI from 2015-16 to 2016 17 has not resulted in a cut to current aid levels or in reduced Australian aid to any region. Assistance to all regions will increase by 2015-16, with the exception of Latin America and the Caribbean which will be maintained around its current level. The deferral has been achieved through a more graduated increase in aid to most regions than originally planned, and a more graduated increase in our support for multilaterals.Growth adjustments were informed by consideration of targets set in the Comprehensive Aid Policy Framework and existing commitments to particular countries, regions, or initiatives.                 (2) Membership of the African Development Bank (AfDB) will demonstrate Australia's commitment as a long-term development partner to Africa. To join the AfDB, a full treaty process, the passage of legislation through the Parliament, and agreement from AfDB members is required. These membership processes are not expected to be concluded before 2014.                  Australian membership of the AfDB offers the opportunity to extend our reach and impact in Africa and to work more effectively in more development areas than are possible when working alone or through bilateral mechanisms.                  The AfDB works in areas that are critical to spurring sustainable growth and reducing poverty in Africa. The Bank received a favourable review in the Australian Multilateral Assessment, which found that funding to the Bank would deliver tangible development benefits in line with Australia's aid objectives and represent value for money.

                 (a) AusAID's Civil Society Engagement Framework addresses commitments made in the Australian Government's aid policy An Effective Aid Program for Australia: Making a difference - delivering real results. The Framework is an overarching policy statement that sets out, among other things, how Australia will work more effectively with civil society organisations in Australia and overseas to increase the impact of aid for the world's poorest.                  (i) In formulating the Framework, AusAID drew on a range of sources including the National Compact between the Australian Government and the not-for-profit sector, AusAID's Head Agreement with Australian non-government organisations, the Australian Council for International Development's Code of Conduct and the Office of Development Effectiveness' report Working Beyond Government: Evaluation of AusAID's engagement with civil society in developing countries.                  (ii) Legal advice was not sought by AusAID in the formulation of the Civil Society Engagement Framework because it is an overarching statement of purpose and strategy for the Government to broaden and strengthen ties with civil society organisations. Compliance with international and treaty obligations is built in to all AusAID agreements with NGOs, which follow the Commonwealth Procurement Rules and the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines. Legal advice is sought on all AusAID contract and grant agreements with NGOs, including advice on whether the organisation is listed as a terrorist organisation under Australian law or under UN regulations.                  (b) See (a)(ii) above.                 (c) AusAID conducted a broad consultation process during the development phase of the Civil Society Engagement Framework. The draft Framework was made available on AusAID's website for public consultation in March 2012. Nineteen submissions were received.                 (i) The Framework draws on whole-of-Government policy statements, including the National Compact between the Australian Government and the not-for-profit sector and An Effective Aid Program for Australia.                 (ii) AusAID discussed the draft Framework with donors including the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The Framework was informed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - Development Assistance Committee's How Development Assistance Committee Members Work with Civil Society Organisations report and the Office of Development Effectiveness' Working Beyond Government report.

                 In line with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules and the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines, AusAID's contracts and grant agreements require our civil society partners to comply with:                 laws in Australia, partner countries and any other applicable laws of other countries                  AusAID policies and guidelines (including counter-terrorism)                 UN resolutions, and                 requirements to ensure that funds do not provide direct or indirect support or resources to organisations and individuals associated with terrorism.                 NGOs that receive funding from AusAID are required to provide AusAID with financial reports and project plans. Project plans are required to outline objectives, outputs and targets for all activities. These are assessed against the objectives in AusAID's guidelines and are subject to approval before funding is granted.                  AusAID's contracts and grant agreements with NGOs require NGOs to have regard for, comply with, and use their best endeavours to ensure that all delivery organisations comply with relevant and applicable laws, regulations and policies, both in Australia and in the partner country. NGOs are also subject to an ongoing program of audits to ensure compliance with these requirements.                  Australian NGOs receiving funding under the AusAID NGO Cooperation Program must be accredited. Accreditation is a 'front-end' risk management tool that assesses NGOs' governance, program management capacity, partner management, links with and support from the Australian public, and risk management, including fraud risk.

                 The Australian Government considers that an efficient and competitive global transport fuel market is the most effective means to deliver transport fuel outcomes for consumers. As such, the Australian Government has not undertaken any research and does not hold any data that indicates the amount of natural gas needed if it were to be used as a substitute energy source for all products and vehicles currently powered by petrol or diesel.

                 (1) Approval was given by Acting Director of Detention Operations NSW/ACT on 26 July 2012 for two high risk asylum seekers to visit the home of Ms Saradha Nathan. Approval was also given for another asylum seeker to attend the home at the same time.                 Prior to the decision, the Department's Detention Service Provider undertook a thorough risk assessment of the clients and the location of the visit and submitted an operational plan to the Acting Director of Detention Operations NSW/ACT. She also considered that the two high risk clients at the centre of this excursion are permitted, pursuant to the existing agreement between the Department and their legal representative, visits outside the Villawood Immigration Detention facility. Approval for the visit was given on the basis of risk mitigation strategies outlined in the operational plan.                 (2) Neither the Minister nor his office were informed of the visit prior to it occurring. Special Purpose Visits are an operational activity. Notification of operational matters including Special Purpose Visits to the Minister's Office is not required.                 (3) The Minister was not briefed on this matter.                 (4) This television interview of asylum seekers during a home visit was raised with the Detention Service Provider, Serco, at a meeting following the incident. Serco agreed to provide the Department with a post incident report, which it expects to receive shortly.                 (5) The Department relies on the advice of the Detention Services Provider on the likelihood of persons presenting a danger to themselves, others and their likelihood of escape from immigration detention while their status is resolved. The two asylum seekers were rated 'high risk' as a result of their involvement in recent incidents.                 (6) The information requested is not held on the Department's electronic data management systems. Obtaining this information would be a resource intensive exercise involving manual extraction of data from hard copy files. As such the Department is not able to provide a response to this question.                 (7) No funding has been granted to Ms Nathan or the Australian Tamil Congress by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.                  (8) No further outings have been approved to the home of Ms Nathan since the incident. Approval to visit the privates homes of other individuals are assessed on a case by case basis at each of the detention facilities.                 (9) A review of the visit is in progress. Abatements may be applied as part of the performance management framework in which performance of the Detention Service Provider is assessed on a monthly basis.                 (10) The Department contracts the Detention Service Provider to manage services for people in immigration detention. This includes managing transport, escorts and visits for detainees. Should there be any issue with the appropriateness or level of service provided by the Detention Service Provider; the Department will take the necessary steps to manage this situation as outlined in the Detention Services Contract.

                 (a) (i) The merit criteria used to assess BlueScope Steel's application were:                 potential of the renewable energy technology encompassed in the Australian Centre For Renewable Energy (ACRE) Project to deliver economic benefits from lowering the cost and increasing the supply of the renewable energy technology or energy generation in Australia over the long term;                   technical strength of the ACRE Project to deliver clearly defined technical outcomes to progress the renewable energy technology along the technology innovation chain and the national and international significance of the technical innovation involved;                 the contribution of the ACRE Project to ACRE's renewable energy and enabling technology priorities, as set out in the Information Guide as revised from time to time;                  the capability of the applicant and any proposed supporting consortium to implement the ACRE Project set out in the proposal, including (as relevant):                 - management capability and expertise of the applicant;                  - track record of the applicant in undertaking similar projects, including delivering in time and on budget;                  - the roles of consortia members and the status of any relevant agreements; and                 - comprehensiveness of the planning for the ACRE Project, including costings, budgets and readiness to commence the ACRE Project;                 the funding sought from the Program for the ACRE Project in relation to the total ACRE Project costs, taking into account:                 - other expected sources of funding and evidence of any funding that has been secured;                  - the financial capacity of the applicant to fund its expected contribution to the project costs; and                 - the position of the ACRE Project along the technology innovation chain;                  the applicant's need for funding for the ACRE Project taking into account the extent of funding for the ACRE Project from other government and private sector sources; and                  the overall risk associated with the ACRE Project as set out in the proposal, including without limitation compliance, technical and financial risks.                 (ii) BlueScope Steel requested $2,284,800 in its application for the project. The ACRE Board assessed this amount of funding as part of the merit assessment and determined it was appropriate for the proposal and represented value for money.                 (b) (i) In assessing the innovative nature of the proposal, expert due diligence consultants and the ACRE Board noted a lack of equivalent commercially developed building integrated photovoltaic technology in the domestic and international markets, and that BlueScope Steel presented strong evidence of being able to develop a product which would contribute to the renewable energy mix in Australia. No other building integrated photovoltaic proposals have been presented to the Emerging Renewables Program.                 (ii) see answer to (b) (i).                 (c) (i) The Emerging Renewables Program is an open, non-competitive grants program, where grant applications are assessed on their individual merit. Therefore, the number or quality of other applications to the program was not a factor in assessing the BlueScope Steel application for funding.                 (ii) None, as the Australian Government does not approach companies to award grants under this Program.                  (d) While there are several technologies under development that relate to building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications across several building structures (such as roofing tiles), I am not aware of any Australian companies which are developing BIPV products using the same innovations as that of BlueScope Steel.  The BlueScope Steel project aims to develop a new roofing profile that joins Australian steel roofing and inverter systems with international second-generation thin-film solar technologies.                 The program has responded to enquiries from companies currently developing building integrated photovoltaic technology in regards to several structures, although, as noted, no funding proposals have resulted from these enquires.

                 (1) Yes. NBN Co Limited's (NBN Co) Corporate Plan of 2012  -  2015 (the Plan) indicates the rollout to communities announced in the three year rollout plan on 29 March 2012 are on track (page 36 refers). The Plan also states the entire fixed wireless and satellite networks are expected to be completed nationwide in 2015 (page 39 refers).                  (2) Yes. The NBN will be rolled out to 100 per cent of Australian premises, including those in the Blue Mountains region.                  I am aware that the Blue Mountains region has not yet been included in NBN Co's first three year rollout plan. The three year rollout plan will be updated in March each year with new locations and rollout information.                  On 20 December 2010, I announced a list of regional towns across Australia that will be receiving the high-speed fibre network. Four towns in the Blue Mountains local government area, Mount Victoria, Blackheath, Yellow Rock and Medlow Bath, were included on this list.                  Less densely populated areas are likely to be served by next-generation fixed wireless or satellite technologies, which will be completed in 2015. The precise optic fibre footprints will only be known when NBN Co completes detailed suburb-by-suburb, region-by-region network designs.

                  There is one strict liability offence in the legislation that I have introduced since becoming Attorney-General on 14 December 2011. This offence is in subsection 36(3) of the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Bill 2012.                 As the identification of strict liability offences requires a manual analysis of enacted legislation it would involve an unreasonable diversion of resources to itemise strict liability offences in all legislation introduced since 24 November 2007 in the Attorney-General's portfolio.

                  (1) Under Section 8 of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 975, I may, by notice in writing, exempt goods from dumping duties if I am satisfied that like or directly competitive goods are not offered for sale in Australia to all purchasers on equal terms under like conditions having regard to the custom of usage of trade. Downstream Australian businesses that import materials from overseas that are not accessible in the Australian market may apply for such an exemption by writing to the National Manager, International Trade Remedies Branch, Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.                 From 2 July 2012 the Government has funded an International Trade Remedies Adviser (ITRA), located within the Australian Industry Group, to provide information and assist small and medium enterprises by periodically reviewing available data about downstream industries following the imposition of measures and assist with preparation of anti-dumping or countervailing applications in respect of those goods. If appropriate, the ITRA will refer matters relating to the dumping of downstream goods to me, as Minister, to determine whether there are grounds for a Minister-initiated investigation, consistent with the World Trade Organization agreements.

                  (a) The major factors for extended investigation timeframes are usually:                  the number of members of the Australian industry party to an application, which may lead to delays in the provision of consolidated information by the Australian industry and its performance over the injury period;                 the complexity of the particular case reflected by the number of potential interested parties, and the number of countries involved, which may require additional processes for sampling parties for the purposes of verification; and                 the complexity of the particular case reflected by the issues raised and the information required to be provided and potentially verified (e.g. combined claims of dumping and subsidisation, with the latter adding a requirement for consultation with foreign governments).                 (b) In 2011-12, 52% of investigations, reviews, continuations and duty assessments were completed within 155 days.

                   (1)                   2.69% of research book publications submitted by universities for the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) evaluations in 2010 were apportioned to the ABS field of research code 2204 (Religion and Religious Studies).                   (2)                   Since                   2002:                   a.                   0.61 per cent of projects funded by the Australian Research Council have included research in Religion and Religious Studies..                    b.                   Religion and Religious studies has been the primary focus of 0.24 per cent of research projects funded by the Australian Research Council.                    (3)                   Yes. The disparity exists because the proportion of research book publications in a field of research is not an accurate reflection of the proportion of research activity in that field of research.                    Books are only one of several research output types commonly produced by the higher education research sector and the ratio of books to other output types varies substantially between fields of research.                    For example, 9% of research outputs apportioned                   to the field of Religion and Religious Studies were books in ERA 2010, whereas only 1% of the total research outputs submitted across all ABS field of research codes were books.                    Of the total research outputs submitted across all ABS field of research codes, 0.45% were apportioned to the ABS field of research code 2204 (Religion and Religious Studies), as the table below illustrates.                    The proportion of research outputs in religion and religious studies in ERA 2010                                   Note: The ERA 2010 Reference Period for Research Outputs was 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008.

                 The Department does not maintain a single database which captures details of all contracts. The Department uses a number of mechanisms to record its contracts including Austender and the Defence Annual Procurement Plan. The Department also has Whole of Australian Government contracts, which are managed by the Department of Finance and Deregulation. Given the broad nature of the question the information sought is not readily available, and an unreasonable amount of Departmental resources would be required to develop a response.

                 The Australian Government does not require medical practitioners to relocate from their patient base when applying the Medicare provider number restrictions under section 19AB of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) in the cases where the district of workforce shortage (DWS) status of an area changes.                  The Australian Government recognises the valuable contribution made by GP registrars and other trainees to service delivery across Australia. Accordingly, medical practitioners are not required to relocate from an established patient base upon obtaining their Fellowship qualification, even if the local area is not a DWS.

                 As committed in the 2007 election context the Government provided $2.4 million in funding over four years to the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project. While the 2012-13 Budget did not provide additional funding for the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project, the Government has allocated over $14.6 million to support community broadcasting in 2012-13. The Community Broadcasting Foundation have allocated funding in 2012-13 to maintain the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project while the government is investigating options for the project's continuation.                 The Australian Government currently supports music activity in regional areas through a range of programs, including the Indigenous Broadcasting Program (which is also administered by DBCDE), the Regional Arts Fund and the Contemporary Music Touring Program (CMTP). Through the CMTP, for example, the Australia Council provides funding to assist emerging and established musicians creating original and contemporary Australian music to take their music on tour to Australia's regional and remote areas. The Regional Arts Fund supports cultural development across a range of artforms, including music, in communities across regional and remote Australia.
